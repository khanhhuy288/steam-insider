       " 'review': \"There's a lot of things going for this game. Music, atmosphere, item collection, diverse enemies, etc. but one severe drawback from my pov.\\nThe game is challenging but not necessarily in a healthy way. Enemies are positioned to attack where it came off as frustrating. With game design, players shouldn't need to approach a new area cautiously for negative surprises - we should clearly see and adapt without needing to die over and over unless we've memorized enemy layouts when they're unclear. It's the (main) difference between Super Mario versus the Syoban Cat game. This game felt as if it was developed to have more 'random' risks than reward.\\nTo be fair, I only played an hour and a half on writing this review, but here are some examples from what I've seen:\\n- A wolf breaks out of a box that begins shaking when you approach it. However, the pixel art and lack of ambient lighting in that location made the wolf unapparent\\n- Witches began firing before they appeared in the player's fov. There are multiple audio cues for when they fire, but having to rely on that is a bad accessibility move. \\n- Enemies apparated/spawned in undeclared locations, which includes the location the player may currently be standing at\\n\\nOne thing that may be worth noting is that I chose the 'hard' difficulty - but that shouldn't matter with a game design heuristic that applies across the board. Enemies inflicting more damage or having larger hp pools scaling with difficulty makes sense - that's a separate topic from the issue addressed above. At any given difficulty, the issue would still stand; the only difference was that I probably died much more often than had it been on an easier difficulty. \\nThe overall combat mechanics make it interesting enough for me to give the game a few more hours of playtime in case this is just an issue of me needing to 'git gud'. And I'll still possibly purchase their upcoming 2019 title, where hopefully the same issue doesn't persist (the trailers look great so far).\\nAs a huge fan of this genre, I'm still very eager to see what Bombservice has in store!\",\n",

       "'A short but sweet metroidvania that is worth your time, especially if you like getting difficult achievements! awooooo Fun game, but a bit too easy imo Momodora: RUtM is the 4th game in the series and easily the best. It\\'s a 2-d action platformer with a simple yet rewarding combat system and difficulty options aplenty. The game is pretty short, about 4 hours on my first play-through (on switch). If you play on normal, I would recommend a second play-through on insane, which adds enemies and drastically lowers the player health bar. Other than that, there isn\\'t a ton of replay value unless you want to find all the hidden collectibles. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this game. . Short but sweet It\\'s really fun! If you like games like Rabi-Ribi or Metroidvania  games in general you\\'d def like this game!! Man, it\\'s short enuf that my monke brain was able to finish it twice within 7.4hrs. Pacifist achievement tho..enemies just decide that suicide is the best route so it becomes part of your kill count :\\'( This game is awesome, it has great art design and an insane diffculty, when played on hard mode, it become a personal fave for its la dark souls but in 16 bit A charming and difficult pixel action platformer. really loveable 2d metroidvania exploration game. animations feel very polished I didn\\'t expect to love this game as much as I do now.\\nThe boss fights felt so smooth, were rewarding, and had great music to them.\\nWorth the pain of repeated deaths for a perfect boss fight. The good: interesting world. I like the music. You can kill enemies with a leaf! Not too long, not too difficult.\\nThe bad: story isn\\'t much. Some sound effects were mistimed.\\nOverall enjoyable. Good game [h1] An Important Note     [/h1]\\nSpecial thanks to my buddy Jp. For a good palate cleanser of a game.\\n\\n[h1]One Priestess to Stop a Deadly Curse [/h1]\\nBasic premise/Story\\n\\nFrom developer studio, Bombservice and directed rdein. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie metroidvania where you play as a young priestess named Kaho as she journeys to the eastern kingdom of Karst to stop a curse that has been corrupting nearby lands including her village. \\n\\n[h1]A Leaf and a Bow? [/h1]\\nUnique Gameplay\\n\\nThe game oozes with 2D bit aesthetics that are both charming and minimalistic. There weren\\'t a whole lot of systems involved to remember. Except using a bow and your leaf to attack enemies, consumables option and even some handy items/spells you can use during combat. Each giving off a passive or active effect. Momodora doesn’t even take that long to beat with my playthrough clocking at just a little bit over four hours. With 99% map completion. The music, while subtle, helped give to life many areas you will visit throughout the map in Momodora. Yet it doesn’t overstay its welcome. There are plenty of save options nearby to save your progress and restore your health and consumables while on the go. Usually bringing up the map and going back to places you previously couldn’t enter is recommended once you gain a key ability that will allow the player to traverse into the new zone. Making backtracking a breeze and using new abilities to traverse is fun. \\n\\n[h1]Moving the Curtain Aside.[/h1]\\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\\n\\nTo my utter surprise I was quite captivated by Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. It’s been some time since I played a metroidvania game and I was hooked by how minimalistic the game details its world, inhabitants, lore and more without saying too much. While I would appreciate some more world-building to flesh out the game some more. I believe Momodora does an adequate job in selling the game’s premise to fans. There is no need to saturate the game further when it would break the balance and momentum of what the game already tries to convey to the player. Not much I can critique on the game, besides wishing for more music tracks. The gameplay was simple and effective by relying on the mechanics given at the start. Players can go deeper with combos in tandem to combat some bosses the game throws at you. In addition to some new abilities you will gain later on to help with traversal and combat. The story surprised me deeply and I couldn’t help, but be touched by the ending. Without any context, it goes into a direction I found fitting albeit one I didn’t expect at all. Still Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a must for newcomers or veterans of the metroidvania genre looking for something new, charming and short.  \\n\\nTotal Times Beaten: 1\\nScore: 8/10 \\nDate Finished: 5/21/21\\nDate Reviewed: 5/21/21\\nHours Played: 4.14 hours\\n Quick Description:\\n-Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th entry in the Momodora series and is hands down the most polished version of the series.  This is a cute, mini metroidvania that metroidvania fans are likely going to enjoy.  It\\'s a one man team and is quite rough around the edges, but makes up for it w/ charm and engaging combat.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Good:\\n-This game has a ton of charm.  There are a lot of cute characters and npcs all over the map.  Even some of the larger than life bosses are adorable looking characters.  I like the contrast between the brutal combat and the cute characters.  There are enemies that kill in 2-3 hits and spikes that instantly kill you.  You would never expect that from such an adorable looking game.\\n-I\\'m a big fan of the pixel art.  I like the way the bosses look, the impact when you hit enemies w/ your weapons, and when small star-like currency flies out of dead enemies.  The environment itself is serviceable, although not as polished as top tier games.\\n-The boss fights are hands down the most fun and challenging part of this game.  There are a quite few bosses in this 5 hourish game.  Some of small and agile, while others are very imposing and towering above you.  These bosses hit hard and are tough.   Memorizing their patterns and equipping the right powerups are key to victory.\\n-Lots of secrets to find.  I really loved exploring the world.  This is not that big of a metroidvania and the map isn\\'t great, but traversing the world is still really fun.  You will be heavily rewarded for checking every square inch the map.  Some secrets are really obvious, while others are more obtuse.  Being able to equip more health potions, finding powerful relics, or simply gaining health can all be found if you search hard enough.\\n-You have a basic short ranged four leaf clover and a long range bow.  I loved that they chose a four leaf clover to be used as a weapon.  It\\'s small things like this that make Momodora stand out.  You can unlock powerups that make your arrows poisonous or add flames to your attacks.\\n\\nCould Use a Few Changes:\\n-Very difficult during the first 2 hrs.  You are way under-powered and thrown into the deep in.  During the first 30 minutes, there are several enemies that can 2-hit you.  Even after the first hr, there are a ton of enemies that can 3 hit you.  There are also lots of instant death spikes to avoid while platforming.  This is going to cause a lot of players to give up before really enjoying the meat of this game.\\n-Pacing could use a lot of work.  I think this game would have benefit from adding one to two more areas and making this closer to a 8 hr experience.  Basically, as of right now, you spend your first two hrs dying left and right, then by the 4 hr mark, you become an incredibly overpowered tank that can brute force its way through almost everything.  If this game were a little longer, then they could have made the beginning a bit easier, and had a longer build up until you become extremely powerful.\\n-Most people do not enjoy one hit death spikes.  They are used quite a bit here, especially in the second half of the game.  There has to be more creative ways to add new challenges to the end of the game.\\n-Some areas of the map are kind of bizarre, and you can tell that this game lacks the polish that the best in the genre have.  You will also see quite a bit of duplicate enemies throughout the game.  Some enemies from the very beginning will also be at the very end in the same form.  This is not ideal imo.\\n\\nThoughts:\\n-I\\'m glad that I finally got around to playing Momodora.  I haven\\'t played any of the other games in the series, but I\\'ve been told that this one is the best and most well rounded of the 4.  There is a final 5th game in the works which I\\'m excited to check out.  This isn\\'t a perfect game but it\\'s a competent metroidvania that fans of the genre should check out.  The dev was clearly inspired by Dark Souls and the challenging, methodical combat is one of the highlights of the game.\\n\\nConsensus:\\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  It\\'s only $10 new but is an absolute steal right now while it\\'s on sale for $4.  If you are scrambling to binge another metroidvania, than Momodora Reverie of the Moonlight is a fun one worthy of your time. i smacked a blue girls tiddies with a sword and they jiggled 10/10 Decent Metroidvania, Slightly Challenging, Janky Hitboxes on Higher Difficulties, Story wasn\\'t anything special. A well-made Metroidvania, with good flow and controls. anime tiddy Really beautiful art style and animations, but slow pacing and lack of some original gameplay features made the game feel pretty monotonous. Also I am not a fan of the music. I\\'ve experienced several headakes while I was visiting some areas that had less resonant music than others.\\nGeneraly good game, but I\\'am not really impressed. Very punishing but not in a fun way. Somehow the fights are not fun. A short but sweet metroidvania. kinda fun This is not a long game, it is not particularly well polished in some regard but it is absolutely worth playing for the tone, atmosphere and general impression. It\\'s a lovely little game A nice ~7 hour metroidvania, good pixel art, good bosses, difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating, relatively simple combat but in an enjoyable way. Fantanstic game, difficulty gets over hyped anyone could beat it if time is put in but even if you\\'re pretty good the game is every likely to kill you. and FAIRLY! there\\'s only a handful of \"kaizo\" traps and they are so few and far between. cute graphics, lit story, actual difficulty that makes you feel good when you beat a \"level\" easy 9/10 another beautiful indie that proves greatness can be had without HD graphics. fun gameplay and good writing go so far. love the game it\\'s a classic and a steal when on sale. easily worth full price and i\\'m a scrooge. Very calming and nice game good game. charming and original. really cool. plesent surprise good excellent metroidvania and cute platformer step on me kaho. awesome sauce The art direction and animations in this are my absolute favourites. The gameplay is also great. Movement is tight, and items are pretty useful, save for one or two. I also love the couple of rooms and side characters that give the world a lot more depth. It\\'s a simple little game you can finish in an hour or so, unless you\\'re going for all the secrets (there\\'s more than you think). One tip: there\\'s a body of water that has a ladder going downwards; you won\\'t drown in that.\\n\\nPlus, it\\'s a really good first game to get into speedrunning, if you\\'re into that. The learning curve isn\\'t steep, and the speedrun chiefly relies on you perfecting your movement. And as I\\'ve mentioned, movement is tight, so you won\\'t find yourself getting frustrated over controls (unless you\\'re doing rolljumps, but that\\'s another story) . For whichever category you decide to do, the upper bound for your first run would be an hour and a half, and getting down to 30-40 minutes shouldn\\'t take you more than a couple of further runs. And lastly, you get to keep seeing the art and animations.\\n\\nAnd yeah ha ha booba funni If you like Castlevania, this one will be right up your alley.\\n\\nCan be difficult at first but eventually you\\'ll get used to enemy attacks with your limited moveset. The bosses are well designed with patterns that can be learned. Controls are sharp with minimal delay between actions, music fits the level perfectly.\\n\\nNo complaints, highly recommend to give this underrated game a try. [*]i\\'ve had the game crash on me multiple times. every time i lost about half an hour of progress.\\n[*]the game is clearly inspired by dark souls game mechanics, yet it only takes the worst of them.\\n[*]there is a bonfire system, yet you lose all progression when you die. that means you have to collect the same item 500 times if you die often.\\n[*]the controls are awful. very sluggish - almost feels you are under water while moving around and jumping.\\n[*]the sounddesign and music are awful.\\n[*]no leveling or gearing your character. you do not ever get stronger. makes killing enemies entirely useless\\n[*]there are 3 achievements that are basically impossible to get. big yikes\\n[*]the sprites and backgrounds look very good but get boring very fast. everything looks the same. also the leaf/autumn theme is kinda lame and boring imo.\\n[*]the main collectible in the game is invisible. you have to walk over it by accident to collect it.\\n[*]hitting detection and damage immunity are awful. you take damage when touching an enemy and when they hit you. yet you do not ever get an invulnerability period after taking damage. this means you can basically get instantly oneshot with full hp.\\n[*]also even the early enemies deal way too much damage. some do like 40% of your total hp with 1 hit.\\n[*]you only have a single attack throughout the entire game, and the useless bow you will never use. yet EVERY SINGLE UPGRADE YOU GET IN THE ENTIRE GAME IS ONLY FOR THE BOW! and even after using all of them at the same time its still useless.\\n[*]the most insulting thing is the ending. you beat the final boss and theres just a textbox that appears that basically says \"yeah that priestess you played, yeah well she was sent to lift the curse, and she did lift the curse. the end\". wow\\n[*]and the big cherry on top... like 20% of this already very short game is platforming over spiketraps that instakill you. enemies knock you around when you get hit just like in ninja gaiden. i love it I really love this game, its a souls-like/2D platformer. I did not expect it to be difficult (spoiler, you\\'ll die), but it is really fun to play and despite the frustrating difficulty scaling, its mostly skill-based and you can get really good at dodging everything. 10/10, a must play indie imo. This is an amazing Metroidvania and you should totally play it!  I got stuck on my first playthrough, but then I got better at these kinds of games, and then I was able to really enjoy playing and beating Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight.  The gameplay\\'s great, so if you like any sort of Metroidvania or platform beat-em-up, I will recommend you this. This game started off great and I really want to like it. Unfortunately, I got about an hour into the game and then four times in a row, the game crashed while entering into the next boss fight. Play as Kaho, the Priestess from the village of Lun! Lately, a terrible, terrible curse has spread across the lands, and the only way to fix it is for Kaho to travel from her homeland to the Kingdom of Karst to seek the aid of the Queen! However, not all is well in the kingdom.\\nMeet plenty of new characters in this short and tragic 5 – 20 hour tale! \\n\\nWhile Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is an adequate game, it’s really hard to say it’s any good until a couple hours in. Until you actually find upgrades and learn attack patterns, every enemy and boss can actually be pretty tough and will kill you if you don’t pay attention. Once all the upgrades are collected, the game is much easier, but the opponents stay exactly the same. Some of the enemies you find in the beginning are the same ones you find right before the final boss room and there really could have been a bit more variety. \\nThe biggest disappointment for me had to be the endings. While I’m not posting any spoilers about it, I probably wouldn’t have gotten the game at all if I had known.\\n\\nRegardless of all it’s faults, it’s not a bad enough game for me to not recommend it, and if you are interested in playing Momodora, I suggest either looking up gameplay videos or reading more reviews first.  \\n\\nTL;DR: It’s a decent game with subpar endings. Play it if you want. One of the best metroidvanias out there, and part of my top 5 solid game 👍 Easygoing 2d metroidvania that will take roughly 3-5 hours of your time depending on how much you want to find all collectables/secrets. \\n\\nUnfortunately, most hidden characters and/or secrets do not serve any real purpose other than acting as cameos or throwbacks to other characters from the dev\\'s other games. It would be really nice if those secrets were a bit more rewarding for the players who do no have the experience of the other games or the knowledge of the random cameos. \\n\\nOverall, recommended if:\\n-bought on a discount\\n-bought as part of a bundle\\n-you have already played all other great 2d metroidvanias out there and you want a bit more\\n-you have limited time and want a 3-5 hour experience. I like the way the game looks but the actual gameplay is underwhelming and the game itself isn\\'t really too long either. If you still want to buy it you should probably wait until the game goes on sale for 60% off because the price feels more justified for what you get. The perfect game for every metroidvania fan. Beautiful soundtrack, nice sprites and GIT GUD! A fun-sized Metroidvania to enjoy for a couple of gaming sessions. :) [table]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Game type[/td]\\n        [td]Metroidvania[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Story[/td]\\n        [td]★★★★☆[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Graphic[/td]\\n        [td]★★★★☆[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Fun[/td]\\n        [td]★★★★★[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Difficulty[/td]\\n        [td]★★★☆☆[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [td]Play time[/td]\\n        [td]★★☆☆☆[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table] Momodora is a fun and sweet title that I recommend to every metroidvania fan.\\n\\nThe Positives\\n\\n-The gameplay is in the style of your typical metroidvania, so don\\'t expect any innovations here. If you love the genre, your enjoyment is guaranteed.\\nThe pace is relatively fast but never so much that you can get away with just button smashing. Furthermore there are some sections that focus more on platforming and offer a decent break from the fighting.\\n-There are upgrades, items and secrets for the player to find but not so many that you end up spending hours upon hours to find out what to do to progress the game.\\n-This was one of my first metroidvanias and I found it accessible and endearing. A great introduction to the genre.\\n-The art and the soundtrack both looks amazing. I wish there was an exploration mode where one can just go around and talk to the characters of this world -that is how compelling Momodora looks and sounds.\\n\\nThe Negatives\\n\\n-A bit easy during the first time one plays it. I died only a few times, all during boss battles and even those took no more than a third try.\\n-A little on the short side. I finished in 6-8 hours and I am but a newbie.\\n\\nThere has been real dedication in the making of this game and it shows. If you enjoy or are interested in metroidvanias, check Momodora out -it is worth full price and if you come across it\\'s a steal. Esse jogo é simplesmente uma delicia do começo ao fim! A short really fun game that you can play in bite sizes of in one sitting Pretty good Metroidvania game, but if there\\'s one thing I learned it\\'s to never take simple game design basics for granted. Can a boss hit me after it\\'s been defeated? Yep. Do I have to sit through the 15 second intro every single time I attempt a boss? Yep. Does a boss have an attack that takes off 75% of my health and has no unique telegraph? Yep. \\n\\nI don\\'t think this ruins the game, but if you compare it to literally any other Metroidvania game, it starts to look a little janky. Only play it if you\\'re already a big fan of the genre. Also, dear god is this game horny. So much so that it\\'s kind of annoying. The TL;DR is: Combat is bad, enemy variety is poor, exploration is dull, almost no meaningful upgrades, and the bosses are forgettable.\\n\\nI want to preface saying that I got all the achievements for this game so I did spend an adequate amount of time playing it.\\n\\nIt\\'s fun enough to play, but is so burdened by flaws and annoyances that pile up into an overall rather unenjoyable experience. \\n\\nMap design ranges from annoying to downright poor design. The actual ingame map is poor, the entire map being just a bunch of red tiles instead of denoting a color for each major region. Additionally, it\\'s filled with numerous one-way paths that make you waste time looping around just to continue exploring if you had the audacity to pick the wrong direction first. Several of these one-way paths are impossible to get back to until you get a late game upgrade, and I use \"upgrade\" very loosely here. \\n\\nBecause for a Metroidvania, the game doesn\\'t really have upgrades. And I mean actual, gameplay improving upgrades letting you advance your exploration ability. The only actual upgrade that does *anything* for exploration is being able to turn into a cat. The problem is this does nothing actually beneficial for you--you lose the ability to make ranged attacks and can\\'t climb ladders (which are common in the game) so you have to spend most of your time as a human regardless. The only thing it lets you do that\\'s special is walk through tight corridors. Those corridors are few and far between throughout the game, like the cat ability was an afterthought. It\\'s as if the developer occasionally remembered they had to do something with it now and then, so they threw in a token room every so often where you have to turn into a cat for 5 seconds before doing platforming as a human.\\n\\nLike most games in the genre, the combat is fairly simplistic, with your options being a melee attack and a bow, along with a roll that has a large number of immunity frames that\\'s mandatory to use to avoid a lot of boss attacks. The combat, though, ended up being one of my biggest annoyances with the game through its poor design and inconsistencies. The melee attack consists of a simple three-hit combo, but the problem is each stage of the combo makes your character step forward slightly. The end result is numerous annoyingly positioned enemies either cause you to fall of a ledge into spikes (which kill you instantly), or cause you to step forward and take contact damage with the enemy you\\'re hitting. \\n\\nSometimes. Sometimes you take contact damage. That\\'s half of the inconsistency in the combat, you sometimes take contact damage from touching enemies, Sometimes you don\\'t! Whether or not you do is based on if the game feels like it. The other half is damage output from enemies and bosses, which has no consistency whatsoever. The same attack can do a massive variance of damage to the point where the damage values feel completely made up and just use a random number generator. As an example, one boss always starts by dropping a lightning bolt on you. Across dozens of observations, the exact same attack at random did barely a pixel of my life bar, a third of it, half of it, all but one pixel, and outright instantly killed me. Exact. Same. Attack. The *entire* game is like this--your life bar is just an imaginary number and the game decides you live or die from an attack based on completely arbitrary values.\\n\\nBetween all of these problems, I ended up just spamming the bow for the near entirety of my playtime. There\\'s nothing tactical about this because you can\\'t move and use the bow at the same time, but the bow was blatantly designed as the superior weapon in the game; the majority of passive equippables and required upgrades in the game buff the bow, the melee attack gets absolutely nothing unless you go out of your way to make it slightly less awful, and you can\\'t do that until shortly before the final boss.\\n\\nThe boss fights themselves were at best acceptable, and at worst just downright annoying due to the combat mechanics. Your character cannot jump very high, and most bosses are the same height as you, with the end result being that if they pin you in a corner you WILL take contact damage trying to escape. Rolling is less useful as half the bosses have erratic movement such that rolling will cause you to take damage regardless. Overall, due to the fact you don\\'t get any meaningful movement enhancing upgrades in the game and no alternatives or real upgrades to your attacks, the boss fights are pretty forgettable HP sponges where you spam the bow until they die.\\n\\nExcept they, for some reason, gave all the bosses special drops if you can beat them without taking damage. Half of these are items you can buy from a shopkeeper slightly later in the game, giving you a small power boost earlier than expected. The other half are exclusive items that are hilariously gamebreaking, capable of tearing through 30-50% of a boss\\'s life in one use (and you get up to 2 uses of each gamebreaker item). The funny thing is all the bosses kill you instantly on Insane difficulty, forcing you to beat them hitless, giving you guaranteed access to all these gamebreaking items that let you crush the bosses without challenge. If the combat and movement systems were good in the game I\\'d accuse this of being cheesy and lame, but the bosses feel like such a waste of time that I fully advocate cheesing them. \\n\\nI\\'ve never played the other games in the series, and that isn\\'t a problem with regards to the story and characters because the game has basically no story or characters. There\\'s an evil curse, you need to cleanse it. End of story. There\\'s like five characters you meet a single time, trust you immediately, and either tell you completely obvious observations about the game world (everybody is dead or a ghost? Wow couldn\\'t have figured that out based on the ominous music and all the ghosts I\\'ve killed so far) or just hand you a key item. Only one of these characters even has a name, which just feels weirder. There\\'s a few other completely worthless NPCs who say equally useless statements like \"I\\'m scared\" that don\\'t add anything. \\n\\nAnd, finally, the game is short. That\\'s probably one of the biggest upsides to the game, in that despite its stockpile of annoyances that incited me to make a review in the first place, it didn\\'t last long enough to make me actually hate the game. It\\'s barely 4 hours long, and that\\'s on a first playthrough that got the true ending, all upgrades, and full map exploration. You can casually speedrun the game in under 40 minutes once you know where to go. Momo4 at its core being a short game is also the root cause of other problems, like how few upgrades the game has. Can\\'t pace those well when you can beat the game blind in a single sitting.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s not offensively bad, not unplayable, is acceptably fun, but the problems with combat, lack of upgrades, dull exploration, and forgettable boss fights really dragged down my opinion of the game. But the game is often cheap on sale so it\\'s still decent for a couple bucks. A short but sweet action-platformer/Metroidvania. Combat, particularly against some great bosses, is the star here. I played the others games from Itch.io before playing this one, and have to say I loved it just as much.\\nThis game looks great, sounds great, and is moderately difficult, with the exception of some of the bosses where it gets pretty hard.  I would have liked a bit more direction, but for the most part its roam around till you make progress ;p\\n\\nOver all I had fun, and the game was pretty nice over all TL;DR: The game has nice graphics but it is awful to play. If you love pixel graphics and don\\'t really care about how the game plays because its indie or whatever, you will love this game.\\n\\nYou can claim I got filtered or whatever but Castlevainia SOTN or any of its derivatives control and play much better than this. Honestly I\\'d rather play Super Castlevainia IV than this. I\\'m very disappointed.\\n\\n\\n---The Good---\\n- Nice Sprite animation and graphics.\\n- Music is ok.\\n- I got this in a bundle.\\n\\n\\n\\n---The Bad---\\n- 4:3 aspect ratio and I can\\'t seem to change it.\\n- Enemies regularly shoot projectiles/run into you from off screen in the first few areas.\\n- Enemies in the early areas seem to do more than half my health in damage on normal difficulty, Why even have a health bar if I can die in two hits? I would prefer a mushroom or fireflower for all the protection it would give me. \\n- Animations look nice, but feel awful to control\\n\\t- Swing animation is stiff and pushes you so far forward that it often puts you inside enemies or potentially into hazards/ off cliffs.\\n\\t- Doing any action after a roll is delayed. You need to roll perfectly to make sure you don\\'t receive any damage, which is annoying when there is more than one enemy on (or off) the screen.\\n\\n- Many death pits/spikes that make this game a chore to play, some less obvious than others. Why would I know that jumping into the water after the boss would kill me instantly? Very fun.\\n Another one of those indie gems.\\nI don\\'t know what I was expecting with a  witch of decay.\\nInteresting story interesting gameplay.\\nCute game \\n\\n Apparently I played it for 8 minutes. Must have been amazing This was a gift from a friend, and I enjoyed it, it had some nice mechanics and abilities, and the boss battles were varied enough. I\\'m not sure if I\\'d have bought it myself, and it froze on pressing \"interact\" A LOT, but that may be an issue just for me. \\n\\nOverall I\\'d say it was decent enough to maybe throw a few quid at it :) I picked hard difficulty on my first play through. It is short and challenging. A game that took a lot longer for me than it should have, great game with good mechanics in place. This game helped me get into metroidvanias. I enjoyed this game. It was rather short, especially for anyone familiar with the way Metroidvania games usually go, but it was well put together. The mechanics felt solid, the combat was fun, the music was well suited, and there was a purpose to exploring. Nice. Solid platformer I really liked it. Fun Metroidvania with excellent art and terrific music. The atmosphere of the world is pleasing and intriguing; I just wanted to keep exploring. I also thought the character design (especially the main character + weapon) was pretty cool and unique. My only critiques are that I wish it were longer and I wish the sound effects were as good as the music. Very enjoyable, but the ending is a little disappointing. This game is good but holy shit it has some really bad difficulty problems Fun. Entertaining. Gud. boring gameplay, couldn\\'t get through it Best game eva great soundtrack with awesome combat mechanics, fluid controls and some really good bosses to fight, is a short but fun experience, one of my favorites :) Friend gifted it to me, Chill game, was entertaining and I liked it! This game is like a compact 2D bloodborne, also the sprites are amazing. You\\'ve got to be careful. Start combining reveries with moonlight, and you\\'re only a step or two from smoking clove cigarettes in a graveyard while writing free-verse poems about autumn.\\n\\nWell, they don\\'t go that far, but for something with such a cutesy look it does manage to create a surprisingly dark and somber mood. Between the falling leaves and misty forests, the shadowy towns and cathedrals, and the ominous red moon overhead--that\\'s never a good sign--there\\'s an awful lot of atmosphere for such a humble-looking little game.\\n\\nEven more so than 3000th Duel this one really stress tests the fundamental strength of the metroidvania genre. How many load-bearing elements can you remove from a game like this while still retaining structural integrity?  Turns out, quite a few.\\n\\nWho needs endless farming and complex crafting systems, zillions of spells and items or a HD graphical sheen? Just hand me some intuitive controls, nice animations, moody atmosphere, melancholy music and a map to fill in, and apparently I\\'m good.\\n\\nThe backgrounds in particular really stand out here. Not only do they look good for their style in a superficial sense, but there\\'s also a real unifying artistry that helps them punch well above their graphical weight. You get the impression that the authors have a solid picture in their heads of this strange world of theirs. It comes across in the coherence of whole aesthetic, as well as the eccentric little touches--the cats, the the ringing bell save points, etc.--that combine to lend extra character.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard people use the term \"souls-like\" to describe the combat, although in this case all that really means is that you have dodge sometimes and maybe think a little bit before swinging your weapon. \\n\\nOh, that weapon, by the way? If I understand it right, it\\'s some kind of magical leaf, which I\\'ve gotta say is definitely a first.\\n\\nYeah, don\\'t ask me why that is. I guess this game doesn\\'t require a whole lot of explanation, which is a good thing since they don\\'t really give you any. Like everything else here, the story is pretty minimal.  You\\'re some kind of magic nun or something who shows up in a cursed land to cleanse it of evil by swatting the dark queen with her killer leaf, and, uh, that\\'s about all I got. \\n\\nBut hey, just goes to show that it doesn\\'t always take a lot.  A tightly-made little game with a strong basic design and a bit of creativity and some signature flair can have an outsized impact.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in a nice metroidvania-style sojourn in a well-crafted setting--and who wouldn\\'t be?--you\\'ll probably walk away happy from this one despite their best efforts to the contrary.\\n\\n\\nYou can find more indie game reviews at [url=https://oddlittlegames.com] oddlittlegames.com [/url] or visit my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34514756/] curator page. [/url]  Thanks, and enjoy!\\n Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (Aka Momodora 4) is the 4th of the Momodora series.\\n\\nThe game is basically the same as Momodora 3 but with quite a lot of graphical updates as well as coding upgrades. The biggest visual change is the protagonist grew to 2.5 tiles height, far higher than the 1.5 tile of Momodora 1 and 1 tile height of Momodora 2 & 3. But the basic engine of the game seems to be the same as Momodora 3 (& 2).\\n\\nThe changes are, there\\'s 2 playable forms of Kaho in this game, the human form (2.5 tile height) and the Kitty form (1 tile height). This enable certain hidden and secret area that are only reachable by the kitty form and certain places that can only be access by human form.\\n\\nThe basic battle is almost the same as Momodora 2&3, with a few changes. They\\'ve restored air dashing and double jump to the game. They\\'ve added an equipment table to the game, so we can now equip the items we found in game. \\n\\nThe coding improvements also allowed certain graphic layout to be possible, making the game more beautiful than the previous series.\\n\\nAs for the story, it\\'s certainly an upgrade compared to the previous series. Both story and story telling shows huge improvements. But still, not up to the professional standard yet. Just enough to keep the plot intact. They\\'ve tried to put some meaning to the previous series in this one. Adding Eri (from Momodora 2) suggesting Momodora 4 is from a timeline before Momodora 2. Kaho herself made an appearance in Momodora 3 as a NPC, so this is somewhere after Momodora 3. But still... it doesn\\'t really matter as even when they tried to link the time line, the story isn\\'t related and player will not miss a thing if they didn\\'t play the other series.\\n\\nLike Momodora 3, this one here has multiple ending. As well as secret areas and hidden items to collect. So completionist can have their fun doing the collection hunt.\\n\\nFrom Momodora 1 to 4 we can see the slow improvements of the games as it gets better and better. Hopefully one day, they will be able to produce some professional ones as Momodora 4 is almost there.\\n\\nFor those who stick with the series since 1, of course you won\\'t want to miss out this one.\\nFor those who are new to the Momodora series, you can play this one without playing the others. But still, give the others a try, 1 & 2 are free on their website. It\\'s just bad. very cool Hardest part of this game is figuring out where the final 1% of your map is. I feel bad because overall I liked this game and enjoyed the experience, but don\\'t think I could recommend it for most people if it was any more than the current four bucks.\\n\\nPros - \\n+ Lovely music\\n+ Cute art style and character design\\n+ Quite good atmosphere most of the time\\n+ Bosses are fun \\n\\nCons - \\n- pretty sluggish gameplay until you get some upgrades, that you dont get until like a third of the way through the game, which really doesnt take that long because...\\n- The game is really short, like I didn\\'t complete the game or anything, but I took my time, got most of the stuff and got the true ending and it took less than five hours\\n- Enemy scaling is really off. you see the same witch enemy after leaving the tutorial area (which by the way, the tutorial consists of mostly enemies that inflict poison on you) is seen literally throughout the game and you see one just before the final boss. The game felt pretty unfair until I got some upgrades, then it just felt pretty easy.\\n- The game doesn\\'t seem designed around only having manual saves at certain locations. With most traps or pits in the game instantly killing you, exploring is really stressful as any character interactions, items you picked up, map you uncovered, etc. is lost if you die and you have to do them all over again. I came back to the game after several months, beat a boss, and came across a lake. I proceed to go \"huh, is there swimming in this game?\", walked in, fell through, and died instantly and had to do the boss all over again.\\n- The games story just feels like a skeleton. I haven\\'t played any of the previous games but it kinda sucked when [spoiler]The MC just kind of unceremoniously dies at the end, and the game is like \"and she was barely remembered at all..... :)\" like really? Also, why does the weapon upgrade that is required to get the true ending just kinda slapped in a well with no mention by anyone whatsoever and no buildup?[/spoiler]\\n- The MC\\'s goddamn idle yawning animation. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s cute, but it really needs to be disabled for a little after boss/story segments. Nothing kills atmosphere like narrowly defeating someone you are meant to feel bad for fighting, seeing the person you killed fade away, not realize you have control again and the MC just step back and yawn like \"what? that\\'s it?\" like, what is your character again? \\n\\nOk so overall, I\\'d say the art, music, characters, and world of Momodora are wonderful, but from a mechanics and story standpoint the game falls really flat for me. If you enjoy metroidvanias and want a game to chill with for an afternoon, you might like the game, but I really wouldn\\'t recommend it beyond that Your character moves so sluggish and slow and attacks even slower, makes already way too powerful enemies almost impossible to beat. Plus the super spread out save points and boring map really makes this one you should avoid.\\n\\n(not rating since I didn\\'t bother to finish it) I loved the design and everything, but the gameplay is awful on keyboard. All the buttons are so close and so different from the \"keyboard pattern\" that destroyed de play. Unfortunately a full potencial game going to my trash collection on Steam :T Not too shabby. Did you play any Metroidvania in the past? if so then you will know what you are getting into - unlocking abilities through exploring, boss fights, and returning to previously unreachable areas with the newly found abilities to continue with your exploration.\\n\\nThe game is fluid and the combat feels very responsive and challenging in the correct, not in a cheap way. \\n\\nAlthough this game feels very short  I will still highly recommend that and if you want a challenge then play this on the higher difficulty. Very cool metroidvania. Super fun. Absolutely loved this game and the entire atmosphere. Everything feels so clean, including the visuals. Highly recommend. Good game overall, would recommend I recently finished this game after looking through my steam library for games that I hadn\\'t touched, and I found it extremely enjoyable.\\n\\nThe game-play was responsive, challenging, and highly rewarding. I chose the Hard difficulty for my first run, and finished the game in around seven hours. Every time I got a game over, from a boss, or a common enemy, or from platforming hazards, I found myself determined to succeed the next time I tried - I just had to try again, and again, and again until I got it right.\\n\\nFor me, the game-play is the biggest draw this game has - that\\'s not to say that the other factors were lacking though. The art, the music, the world, and the way the story is presented were all deeply enthralling. I\\'d also have a hard time trying to point out a significant number of flaws in the game, there\\'s nothing negative that really comes to mind. Next, I\\'ll be trying the Insane difficulty and attempting to get all the achievements. Better than Hollow Knight tbh This is a game you really need to take your time with, don\\'t rush through every section even when you have the fluid controls to do so. Go slow to go fast, I\\'ve spent over 10 hours in this game and most of it was me dying or trying to collect everything.\\n\\nOther than that, it\\'s challenging but rewarding. A beautifully cute artstyle on top of a story that\\'s kinda dark. Cute, fun and addictive metroidvania that pulls you in with enjoyable combat and exploration without wasting your time on excessive RPG elements. Hardcore in the bad way. Trial and error design. Hidden instakill traps, lose everything since last save. Fuck this. Graphically pretty, challenging but not frustratingly hard, and a lot of fun to play. Definitely something I would play again and again! The story is really interesting and it\\'s really quite nice how it plays out. I would love to see more in this vein (I know about the other games, but they\\'re a slightly different genre, and I like the open exploration of Metroidvania). If you love Castlevania, you\\'ll probably feel at home here.  While there isn\\'t a lot to say about the story, the gameplay, music, sounds, and pixel-art are all top notch! Recommended to me by a friend who knew I loved waifus and man, this game turned out to be much more than that, a short journey I just never wanted to end, and enough fun to that sweet ending. I couldn\\'t recommend this game anymore to anyone looking for some great skill developing content as I instantly clicked on wanting to gain every achievement. We\\'re not there yet but we\\'re really close. I love this game. Aloha, this is my review of Momodora, a side-scrolling Metroidvania platform RPG where you play as a white robed priest named Kaho and use the most unlikely of weapons [a maple leaf! oh Canada!] to fight through hordes of monsters and bosses and stop the queen\\'s curse from corrupting the land. If you liked Minoria, then consider getting this game. If you haven\\'t played either, then I recommend Minoria as being the better of the two.\\n\\nThe Good: Pixel graphics and music are great, the controls are tight and responsive, the fantasy setting is imaginative too. The game is quite brief [my first run lasted 4 Hours 20 minutes], but there is new game+ and other challenge modes to satisfy even the most soul\\'s-thirsty masochist.\\n\\nThe Bad: low monster variety, combat is simplistic [dodge, stunlock, kill], the minimalist story that would make Dark Souls seem overly detailed, characters were forgettable.\\n\\nThe Ugly: the challenge modes are linked to the steam achievements [even no deaths], so don\\'t expect to 100% this game. This game is criminally underrated Solid action-platformer metroidvania with decent boss fights. I had fun for most of my playthrough, but I was definitely ready for it to be over by the time I got to the end of the game. Excellent metroidvania. Plays incredibly well. Animations are smooth, the main character is very agile. You don\\'t automatically take damage by touching an enemy instead only when it attacks you (I prefer these types of systems). Good pick up and play.\\n\\nAlso very cute. A beautiful action-platformer, 4 hours of fun, great music, great visuals, but too short and has difficulty balance issues\\nIt\\'s a nice light Metroidvania/SoulsLike for those who can\\'t get enough of the genre. After finally Perfecting the game (100% achievements), I had better write a review. \\n\\nThis is one of my absolute favorite games and I can\\'t recommend it enough. I don\\'t know if everyone will get the special feeling I do from this game, but even if you have a more casual interest I think you\\'ll enjoy it.  It\\'s cute, short, and made very well. To me, the game is basically perfect and I have no complaints whatsoever. It\\'s one of the first games I\\'ve speedran and it\\'s the first real game I\\'ve Perfected.\\n\\nIf I look past the emotional attachment I\\'ve gained for Momodora over the years I still think it\\'s a beautiful game. The traversal is fun. You get a variety of skills and powerups in Metroidvania fashion (more Castlevania than Metroid) and several of them affect how fast you can move as well as allowing you to explore and progress. The combat is simple and even trivialized by some of the powerful items, but the difficulty levels are very well tuned so you can have the challenge you want. The simplicity is redeemed by being polished to very satisfying levels. The art, sound design and music are fantastic. It succeeds at being both very cute and somber. The writing for the story, lore and characters walks the line of telling you just enough to have a solid foundation while leaving a lot up to the interpretation of the player. As you can tell, every aspect of the game follows the trend: less is more. It works because it\\'s so cohesive and polished. It could feel empty or basic, but the mood is just right and you\\'ll become much more invested than you would expect.\\n\\nMy save files suggest that you can expect 5-6 hours from the game at minimum, which is already worth the price tag. The game doesn\\'t feel short. I think it\\'s very replayable (and speedrunnable!) and you could get a LOT more out of it.\\n\\nShout out to halfcoordinated! Life is both a gift and a challenge. I like the characters! If this were an SNES game, it\\'d be considered a cult classic by today\\'s standards.  A clear Metroid-like game, moreso than many that have come out recently.  It\\'s not too long, nor is it overly burdensome with story/dialogue.  There are secrets to find, but it\\'s not a difficult game, but it\\'s a solid romp.  Good controls, music is a bit unmemorable if you beat bosses and try not to no-hit them.  Some design quirks I disagree with, but nothing that makes the game unplayable or broken. It\\'s a fun game booba Short and sweet, a cute metroidvania about a priestess going to a foreign land to cleanse the source of the blight that has affected her hometown.\\nGameplay is responsive and pretty fun, though platforming is a little awkward.\\nArt is great, and level design works well with it.\\nSounds are limited but the music is excellent.\\n\\nI\\'d certainly recommend this to someone looking for a short adventure where they can get totally lost in a fantasy world. A great game with strong mechanics.\\nA small Metriodvania with a hint of Souls\\nand plenty of replayabillity. Visually appealing \\nin many ways, I actually think the store page trailer \\nlooks really bad compared to the game itself [h1]Introduction[/h1]\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (RUtM) is a metroidvania (2D platformer with sprawling map that encourages backtracking once your character earns powerups) where you play as Kaho, a priestess tasked with saving her land from a curse. You traverse various castle grounds in search of the queen\\'s help, wielding your magical leaf and bow, gaining magical items and meeting characters along the way. The game is the fourth in a series, although you don\\'t have to have played the previous games to understand this one.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nWhile your main weapon (a magic leaf) stays the same throughout, so much of the game is about smooth and satisfying combat. Each encounter is an awesome acrobatic romp, as you vanquish evil with well timed dodgerolls, quickly fired arrows and a good whack of your leaf. \\n\\nAfter about an hour on \"normal\" mode, I played the rest of the game on \"hard\" mode, which was a good balance between challenge and stress. Most situations could be navigated through with a little determination and careful planning, and the variation in magical objects and loadout to use definitely added to the fun. When the difficulty ramped up with the boss fights, you were challenged to understand their patterns and attack accordingly. At most moments I felt powerful and threatened at the same time, which was an amazing balance. Again, I cannot understate how smoothly the combat plays. The only critique I have of this aspect of the game was that [i]sometimes[/i] the hitboxes felt a millimeter or two off, but for the most part they were fine.\\n\\nThe enemies and bosses varied in interesting ways, and the exploration of each map area was interesting as well. \\n\\nIt should be said that the game is shorter than your average metroidvania. I was surprised to check my map after a few hours and see that I had already covered 40% of it. That said, it doesn\\'t really detract from the quality of the game - and the calls to replay it on \"insane\" mode (with only 1 hp) or with a pacifist run, speak louder than most games given the enjoyability of the combat and movement.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nThe story reminds me of Dark Souls (doesn\\'t everything?). The characters don\\'t say much, although they do say enough for you to connect with the overall downtrodden and derelict mood of the game. The mood and exposition are compelling and they do drive the player forward through twists and turns, which end up jam-packed in this short game. Like Dark Souls, much of the lore is stored in item descriptions, for those who are interested. \\n\\nThe characters are interesting, though this aspect does suffer slightly for its preoccupation with an anime girl aesthetic. For instance, it is a little embarrassing or distracting when the chest of one of the bosses reacts to the swipes of your leaf. But for the most part the anime girl aesthetic isn\\'t foregrounded, and there is also something to be said for having a cast of interesting female characters who mostly aren\\'t sexualized. \\n\\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\\nThe pixelated art of this game is beautiful. It isn\\'t exquisitely detailed, but it is worth looking at and is distinct all the same. Each section of the map was a vibrant (or deliberately not vibrant) area that I looked forward to exploring.\\n\\nThe only critique of this aspect comes along with the previously mentioned critique, there is occasional unnecessary sexualization of the cast of female characters, but, again, this isn\\'t too significant, I would say. \\n\\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\\nThe audio here is the extravagant seal on this 16 bit love letter. All of the sound effects are delightful saw waves and square waves. And the background tracks for each boss battle and map area, while not staying in the 16 bit style, are [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXGdHu1b1fg]evocative and encompassing[/url]. \\n\\n[h1]Technical & Other[/h1]\\nIt took a while to set up the proper resolution of the game, and occasionally the were issues with audio, but these issues weren\\'t significant.\\n\\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\\nMomodora: RUtM is a fun little metroidvania. It is short, but a treat to play given its satisfying combat, and was only helped by its compelling story and characters. I urge you to play it and give some enemies a good 3 hit combo of the magic leaf. This game has some pretty big issues. I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the price tag, or the 9/10 on steam. \\n\\npros:\\n- nice pixel art\\n- cool enemy designs\\n- a couple fun boss fights\\n- a few memorable ost\\'s\\n- area aesthetics are pretty looking and distinct\\n\\ncons:\\n- boring combat: devolves to just stunlocking regular enemies\\n- boring platforming, almost annoying: not helped by spikes and pits which can instantly kill you\\n- slow sense of progression which isn\\'t helped by mandatory backtracking which makes the game a slog to get through\\n- story is confusing and uninteresting.\\n- the save system does not keep map exploration, therefore making it even more tedious to progress\\n- enemy damage is way too high (a lot of regular enemies can 2 shot you)\\n- boss and enemy telegraphs are sometimes unreasonably short to react to (resulting in cheap hits which shred half your health)\\n- when they are telegraphed, they\\'re sometimes lazily done with a white circle which indicates multiple different attacks\\n- a couple bosses have way too much health making it an unfair and boring endurance fight considering how much damage they do\\n- enemy variation is sparse and doesn\\'t make areas seem unique and fun to progress through\\n- overpriced for the value you get from it (4 hours of subpar gameplay)\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a good metroidvania for a similar price, I suggest checking out either Hollow Knight or Ori 2. That was some really nice 6 hours . I like \" cute \" ? games like this. You know, the type of game that is not mean to get you in for 100 hours and more, but that want to get you in their universe, a world not well know, but you, you\\'re here, and you\\'re discovering it all, by yourself, and it takes you away from your reality for thoses few hours of play time.\\n\\nI wish there were more details about the background story, the npc you meet, your own story and such. But maybe I missed a lot of hints about the lore !\\n\\nAlso your character is cute, you fight others cuties and that\\'s nice uwu. A short but very well polished metroidvania game. The breast Metroidvania game, bra none. it real good A really short, but really fun game. Never felt like a drag, the controls were responsive and the environment never felt samey. Worth a play. This is a gorgeous Metroidvania with intuitive controls, a great soundtrack, and probably the cutest player sprite in game history. It\\'s short (<5 hours on first playthrough) but a great little adventure, especially if you get it cheap. Additional difficulties offer reasons to come back and I actually WILL because the game is so refined and satisfying to play. If you want a cute 2D Dark Souls platformer and you\\'re tired of Hollow Knight, go for Momodora: RUTM. ⠀ This is a pretty fun game to play if like pixel style metroidvania type of games. I enjoyed this a lot and it sorta reminded me of hallow knight. you can smack witch mom\\'s boobs to death Fun game. A really cool, short, atmospheric metroidvania. It is unfortunate to me that this game is mostly known for the big titty boss fight in it and nothing else but what you gonna do. That boss fight is legendary though, I would shoot my miserably microscope load on her fine ginormous bosom. It\\'s only about four hours long, but it\\'s a fun and beautifully animated metroidvania.  Also entirely possible to 100% without having to look up a guide for something obscure and dumb, which is nice. \\n\\nAlso you can turn into a cat and it\\'s adorable. A massive step up from the previous three games. This title is the most unique in the mainline Momodora series and it can no longer simply be summed up as a \"Cave Story fangame\". I\\'ll start off by saying that it\\'s not a bad game at all, but if you\\'re looking for a straight up Metroidvania like I was then this isn\\'t it. The difficulty is a bit extreme for me, the combat almost feels a bit Dark Souls-ish which I am personally not a fan of due to its frustrating nature. However, if you\\'re a fan of both Dark Souls like games and Metroidvania\\'s you\\'ll probably enjoy this. I gave up after dying 10 times in a row on the third or fourth boss I came across, that\\'s unfortunately not enjoyable to me. This game is skim on content. Character designs are wonderful, but the character writing is pretty poor. The story is short and bog-standard. Level design is okay, and I like the combat and movement of the game. Seems to be lacking in polish overall though. Bosses weren\\'t very interesting, as I don\\'t think any had more than 3 attacks. Impressive effort from an indie title though Short and sweet game with very evocative soundtrack and environments. Gameplay is fair to the player, no frustrations. Pretty easy to play and should be accessible to most players. Definitely worth a play for any castlevania fan. Momodora is a short game, but a game full of charm. While quite linear in the opening sections, it opens up a lot in the later parts of the game, allowing for a wonderful metroidvania experience. 8.5/10 would recommend for metroidvania fans. Honestly with the big witch boss and the Japanese theme, I thought this was going to be a cheap weeb game, but was left delighted by fluid combat, nice atmosphere and an overall fun experience.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit short, but I grabbed it on sale and 100%\\'d\\n\\nI\\'ll play again to get a better time. I did not think this game would last only five hours. \\nI also didn\\'t think I played for five hours. It felt like much longer. Bounced off the game at first, but came back and love it now. Give it a shot. To me this Game feels like a Mini Metroid-Vania wich plays really well. The Best part of the Game is Probably the soundtrack and the athmosphere but right after that is the combat and fluent controlls.\\n\\n4Hours of fun, and if you are into 100%ing games you will Probably have something to do for 20+ Hours. \\n\\nWould Recomand anytime. Man I wish Luna Nights had exploration at least as good as this game Great little metroidvania. Traditional, and gets all of what you\\'d expect executed extremely well. Highly recommended for fans of the genre, took me just over 6hrs to beat. Not very difficult - more on the easier side of things. _ This was a very fun Metroidvania! Certainly helped scratch that itch I\\'ve had since silksong was announced (still tba right now :C) Momodora is a very nice game, it\\'s short and sweet, it personally started slow to me, but it really picked up halfway through, and the music especially picks up in the last quarter Hitboxes seem a little janky at times. But over all it\\'s a fun game for anyone scratching that Castlevania Itch. Super cute Metroidvania. Totally worth the ten bucks they charge. Combat feels good and precise. The boss fights are challenging without being absurdly broken. The pixel-art is lush and gorgeous. The soundtrack is minimalist and fitting - very haunting and elegiac and the sound effects are the right mix of modern and retro to fit the visuals. Great game, Hard Mode is great for getting good.\\n\\nJust don\\'t get hit and you won\\'t die. Great metroidvania game. Beautiful pixel art and OST, responsive controls. It\\'s relatively short, but very worth it. It was a short fun game. The Bad Ending is really a slap in the face, not sure I want to play it to get the good ending after that. A heated argument about bow usage broke out between me and two of my friends You\\'re doing yourself a disservice if you don\\'t give this game a playthrough, it\\'s quality of production is astronomical, I would like to personally thank rdein for ever making this, the art is superb, the platforming is tight, and the combat is a joy, with all of these ingredients combined, you get a short but incredibly sweet Metroidvania that pushes all of my buttons as a fan of the genre.\\nIf you want to get into Metroidvanias, Momodora 4 is the perfect gateway I can think of. it let me slap a witch\\'s tittys with a leaf I\\'ve had this for a long time, I couldn\\'t remember playing it and why I quit after an hour and a half. Now I remember.\\nThis game is FUCKING hard.\\nIt\\'s not Dark Souls hard. It\\'s fair, but still pretty difficult. It\\'s very satisfying and often frustrating, but, that doesn\\'t matter. It really doesn\\'t because they have an \"easy\" mode. You get the full game play experience at half the sanity cost. Now the actual gameplay...\\nThe graphics are awesome and the animations are super smooth. Whacking an enemy with your oversized maple leaf (yep) has nice weight and THUNK to it. Your bow and arrow is lighting quick and devastating.... Which I actually really like. How many games have you played where your ranged weapon just bounces off them making that PING PING PING sound. Not here. She\\'s like, Lady-Hawkeye-Avenger-Style with her bow. \\n\\nBasically, the \"spiritual sequel\" is in the Humble Bundle today which made me wanna go back and finish this game. I\\'m still in the middle of the game and it is very worth it. The plot is cool too, I guess, if you\\'re the type who plays games for the plot. \\n\\nTLDR: Sick as f*** Metroidvania Action Platformer with bomb graphics and awesome music. Stop stalling and just buy this, it\\'s on sale for 4 bucks, ffs. honestly, this game is just way too short for me to reccomend, sue me. This game is very cute and fun. There is also a decent amount of bonus content, including a better ending that is found by exploring and getting items. Overall, very fun experience and I would definitely recommend this game. :D I enjoy the setting and atmosphere of the game and the combat is fair but brutally punishing if you mess up akin to dark souls games.\\nBut the game is lacking a lot when it comes to exploration. I was hoping for lots of secrets and upgrades but found almost none of them, and only two upgrades that served as traversal abilities. It\\'s easy to understand why as the game is very short from what I expect of a metroidvania. I couldn\\'t help but to feel disappointed when I realized I was close to finishing the game, just as I felt I was warming up to it.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have much time for games or prefer shorter MVs then yes; this game is for you. I watched someone play this who mentioned the issues they had with the game, such as attacking and difficulty, and, in all honesty, i love this game, it\\'s great, it is tons of fun, the art s really pretty and the bosses aren\\'t unfairly difficult or unbeatable, at least so far, i\\'m having a great time playing this game.\\nI really recommend it if you are looking for an easy cheap game that helps you get into plataformers and souls like genre without it being really difficult and long like hollow knight (which is an amazing game). Honestly, this game deserves more recognizion but...i wish it had upwards attack though.\\n\\n\\n A Trip back to an old school styled Castlevania-like. Graphics are kept simple, but pleasing to see, and (more or less) easy to tell them apart. Controls are very responsive, and allow you to flow in combat from one attack to the next.\\n\\nDifficulty wise, I\\'d put it about the same as \"first time though Dark Souls\": The game WILL give you a beating, but it does use patterns that you can pick up on and figure routes around or though encounters with minimal effort. It\\'s a pretty nice metroidvania game albeit on the short side. Took me maybe four and half hours to reach the final boss and another hour to go back and 100% the map and grab all the main collectibles before finishing the game. I found the environmental visuals and the level design in the game to be pretty good, and I like a lot of the enemy designs too. There\\'s something oddly captivating about one boss in particular, Lubella, that really managed to draw me in. The addition of the [spoiler]cat sphere, allowing the player to transform into a cat[/spoiler] was great way to switch things up a little bit and everything felt really smooth and good playing that way. Generally the game controlled pretty well, and the oomph behind your hits is satisfying, but I did feel the melee combat could be a touch clunky at times with often accidentally bumping into enemies and taking damage while stepping forward to attack. To finish off, the last boss was kind of anti-climactic. Both in presentation and difficulty I\\'d say they were outdone by bosses prior, but especially difficulty-wise. Altogether it was a fairly fun game that I\\'d absolutely recommend checking out. tl;dr: fun game with a handful of design blunders. unbind your melee button after you beat frida. wouldn\\'t replay. good value at $10. bow feels like an oversight because of how strong it is, enemy mechanics and stages are built around the melee.\\n\\nother reviews have the good, so let\\'s focus on the bad: the core of my issues with the game is that the game shines during boss fights. exploration is not the focus of the game - the game is more combat-oriented than something like hollow knight. i don\\'t know if this is a fair statement to make given that i\\'ve only done one playthrough of momodora and a handful of HK but given how the game pushes you into using degenerate speedkill strategies in order to acquire loot from bosses and how ALL of the trash enemies besides one enemy, in the **tutorial** of all places, are complete pushovers with the bow makes me stand firmly on how i feel after playing around with the ingame systems.\\n\\n1) boss drops are really powerful and are only obtainable when you flawless them (excluding Edea\\'s Pearl), so cheese burn strats / persistence is the name of the game. this is a design issue on its own given the scarcity of items in the game (max 16 actives in inventory, 17 passives in inventory) because other items don\\'t compare. this issue becomes amplified when coupled with boss loot conditions. boss items allow extremely easily speedkill strategies using the bow and items. i was able to melt the final boss\\'s 3 health bars in roughly under 30 seconds while active.\\n\\nthe game doesn\\'t tell you about this method of loot acquisition either (I only found out because I wanted to see if I could go underwater after beating up milky machine and her adopted child - spoilers, I didn\\'t save), and thank god it\\'s a short game or you have heavy incentive to abandon your save game and try again from the beginning when/if you figure it out. most bosses have save points directly before them, with the exception of frida and discount ornstein and smough.\\n\\npocket incensory and bakman patch are by far the worst offenders of this, considering you can get them both early since the game is non-linear. you get those and necklace of sacrifice and you\\'ve basically won the game already. tainted missive\\'s additional two stacks from generic anime waifu protagonist lets you proc the necklace without additional setup, allowing you to oneshot almost every common enemy in the game. the other powerful items that aren\\'t from bosses STACK with this, allowing for really high damage multipliers (roughly 4x damage at low HP, and you want to be at low HP all the time during bosses for easy resets if you fail the loot condition)\\n\\n2) persistent contact damage makes several bosses unpleasant to fight, specifically the crow boi. there are two ways to offset contact damage in this game - stunning the enemy temporarily makes them do no contact damage, or don\\'t use the leaf. bosses gain stun immunity after a certain amount of hits and may win trades since the leaf is slow and has small range - BUT you can deflect SOME projectiles with it.\\n\\ni hope you like ranged weapons, because the bow is easily the best weapon in the entire game when you\\'re playing casually. the leaf by comparison is borderline suicidal with a pretty bad return on investment because of occasional soft counter-attacks in melee range, lack of passive item support and forced movement when slashing. git gud and/or use the bow. i ended up resorting to using missive + necklace + bowspam + bakman to quickkill every boss after i got tired of fennel counterattacking me during my third hit of my combo because i didn\\'t want to spend a ton of time mastering how to roll away from her, only to get hit by her teleport contact damage OR rolling into her because her sword hitbox takes up a fourth of the screen, and you can\\'t jump over it either. i then pulled out the godslayer greatbow and shot her in the head 5 times and had a major anticlimax, because she\\'s a fun fight despite all the asspulls of getting hit ONCE and having to retry. it feels like the game is balanced around speedkills because enduring some of these faster fights is not feasible after a few minutes.\\n\\ni don\\'t enjoy using the bow - enemies are not built around it aside from the few that are immune to bow damage (lol). i used the leaf for the majority of my playthrough on hard and made it take much longer by extension. as soon as you get the first boss drop, the melee attack becomes objectively bad and after you get more ranged support then your leaf becomes a nice trophy in your key items. if you opt for using the megashark or magic builds when you play terraria, you probably won\\'t mind this. as a stubborn melee user, i\\'ll get my teeth pushed in for no reward other than for the fun of doing it.\\n\\nin conclusion, the way bosses flow make me feel like you\\'re intended to use both melee and ranged damage to defeat them, but their mechanics incentivize playing at range and invalidating wanting to play as fennel but with a leaf because of contact damage. why even give me the option to use melee?\\n\\nif I were to fix this, i would add boss refights that drop their loot at the end of the game or have bosses always drop loot in the main story, with speed adjustments to punish playing at range.\\n\\nedit: also the level design is somewhat questionable but people have already read through this much so i won\\'t elaborate further\\nedit 2: i went to look back vs fennel and apparently you can jump over the sword twirl, i just jumped too early and it\\'s pretty precise. the teleport still catches me though, need way more practice roll cancelling. i found this out through a speedrun on twitch\\n\\nso i play on hard like an idiot Momodora RUtM is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The previous three entries in the series, while very pretty in their own right, have nothing on this game. (By the way go grab Momodora\\'s 1 and 2 for free off the developer\\'s itch.io and then grab 3 for two buck here on steam, they will take you an afternoon to beat). Anyway Momodora 4 is the perfect culmination of the best element from previous entries (metroidvania map from 2, equippables from 3) refined and expanded into a game that is as fun to play as look at. The only downside is the length. While the longest in the series by a large margin I still blasted out a playthrough in 6 hours. That said I immediately started a second play to find more secrets and generally just experience the damn thing again. I have a system where if I get one hour of playtime per dollar spent on a game then it was worth the money so you will still probably get your money\\'s worth. Doubly so if you get it on sale. Buena musica y buena dificultad. Deja algo que desear en lo que respecta al lore del juego pero aun asi disfrute jugandolo If you like sailor moon you will like this game. Excellent Metriod-Vania-Souls. Short game, but a lot of fun I remember when this came out and everyone was fixated on the giantess witch. I mean I\\'m not judging but I remember every video titlecard being just that. NIce little soulsy metroidvania. Just about the right length for me at ~5hrs. Really cool pixels and the character feels great to control, basically all you need. Recommended Really fun and cute. very cool Pretty good art, the game difficulty is pretty fare, but its a bit short This game is a beautiful form of media, and has so many things going for it. Atmospheric soundtrack, amazing sprite work, engaging combat. I am confident that you will be able to find something you love about this cute metroidvania, as I have. With it having fancy enemies, niche graphics and being hard to master, Momodora\\'s quite the gem to play Metrovania with a decent challenge but not the hardest one. Momodora is a short sweet and challenging metroidvania. The pixel style is very good and the soundtrack is well done. If you are looking for a short quick metroidvania that will run you probably 6 hours to complete with a new game + this is one to check out...also you can turn into a cat so that is a plus.\\n\\nRating: 7-10: A short sweet metroidvania that doesn\\'t add anything new but is pleasant none the less. Idk this game was just really good! The combat felt nice and balanced, like you couldn\\'t just blaze through enemies you would have to actually dodge and combo them to kill them. The platforming was fair and tight. Overall it was really satisfying to play! A cute metroidvania with an interesting story and surprisingly dark world.\\n\\nI really enjoyed it! Great metroidvania by Brazilian developer rdein. Spotless pixelart, and the controls are great. If you like metroidvania games, you\\'ll enjoy playing this, no doubt. Pretty little game. A tribute to dark souls I found very enjoyable. Great metroidvania.  Simple to play but still difficult enough to be interesting. Literally last week did I finally try out Momodoro III. I had it in my steam library for the longest time but never found the chance to play it until recently. I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed the game, so I went back and found the first and second games which I played through as well, making me further appreciate the polish and love that went into the third game. This game, however, was supposed to be the last one.. and it was!\\n\\nMomodora: RUtM ended up being a very enjoyable experience, despite a couple of originally poorly left tastes. I\\'ll get to that.\\nWhat I want to say now though is that for 10 dollars? Hell yeah, get this game. No doubt about it, you get your money\\'s worth. You get your money\\'s worth and then some if you do happen to get it on sale.\\n\\nNow the gameplay of this game is very simple. Attack with a leaf, attack with some arrows, and roll. That\\'s all there is to the main mechanics. You\\'re able to spice things up with passive items that affect certain things regarding money, attacking, etc. There\\'s also active items which recharge on every ring of the bell, so you never feel pressured about stocking up on something for a helpful pickmeup since it works around replenishment. Otherwise, there\\'s just a big map to explore, plenty of bosses to fight, and enemies to beat up that stand in your way. I enjoy the combat despite the simplicity. That single 3 hit swing is satisfying to pull off, and unlimited use of range moves to a separate button separates this game from III as the superior in range, since it\\'s so easy to just create a projectile. \\n\\nOne of the biggest changes, and seriously, I can\\'t emphasize this enough... that I appreciated was the change to bosses from Momodora III. For every Momodora game before this one, bosses always felt... poor? Like, the challenge was there, but for some reason, bosses in the prior games did not randomize the move they would do next. You always knew what was coming and when they would break for you to attack. I never liked that because it was less about reaction times and more about repeating steps until victory. In this game, the attacks are randomized in execution and bosses, for the most part, are attackable whenever. It instead goes for a proper balance of mixing when to dodge to when to attack, and that felt so much better instead of waiting for the same moment again and again.\\n\\nNow there are two major gripes with this game. Both of which I fell victim to because... the game sure as hell doesn\\'t tell you. One: there are boss items you can get. BUT. The catch is that you MUST beat them without getting hit. This isn\\'t even something I would have thought to try unless you told me there was something out of it. On top of this, if you beat a boss and do get hit, the item you get from that is lost permanently for that run. I don\\'t like it when games put a super high risk like this for a reward, because you\\'ll often find that built in stuff now has no utility if you want these items. Heck, there\\'s an item that increases your attack by 100% temporarily for the cost of some health. But guess what? Self damage during a fight still counts as taking damage! There\\'s also a ring that increases damage when low on health. Also useless, because you\\'d have to get hit in the fight to even trigger the effect! I hate that. \\n\\nNow, I should say that beating the bosses without getting hit isn\\'t particularly hard. It isn\\'t easy either though, and you\\'ll find yourself getting frustrated because this idea of not getting hit conflicts with the idea of the game. The items you get for beating bosses without taking damage aren\\'t necessary by any means, but that doesn\\'t exactly make me feel any better about how they\\'re locked away by a conflicting mechanic.\\n\\nThe other issue? This one is dumb, seriously. There is a unique shopkeep within the game that has one condition to decide whether it appears or not. If you break this condition, you will never know he even existed. This guy sells unique stuff only he has too, and that is a good way to make someone mad when they find out later. Unless, of course, you don\\'t even look up a guide. Then you\\'ll never know he existed since nothing tells you!\\nWhat\\'s the condition? There is a spider that shows up in the first area. He\\'s the only one that looks the way he does (other than the unique shopkeep) and is the only non-boss enemy to have dialogue. Now, it\\'s dialogue is \"Uguu...\". Okay. Don\\'t know what that means. Might as well go talk to him, right?\\nBAM! You take damage by walking into him! So he\\'s an enemy! Kill him! \\n\\nBut no. He\\'s an enemy, but one that, if you kill, never reappears and you can\\'t access the shopkeep anymore. If you wanted me to keep him alive, game, why do you make him hurt me? That\\'s incredibly misleading. Whatever. If I had one other minor gripe, it\\'s that you could easily miss the item that lets you warp around until late in the game if you don\\'t know where to look. Go through the area that requires diving underwater first when given the option to go multiple ways. Once you get a new ability, then go back to the place where you started. This will be very helpful!\\n\\nReally though, those are my only gripes with the game and they\\'re not even that big. The game is somewhat short if you don\\'t go for everything, but I recommend going for everything since it makes the game a lot more enjoyable. I really wish that the idea of making the next Momodora game 3D wasn\\'t scrapped as I would have really liked to see how it transitioned. I hope this won\\'t be the last game in the series, because I\\'d love more of the gameplay that III and this brought to the table!\\n\\n(Also get Momodora III) Pretty cool adventure indie game. Pretty similar to Blasphemous.\\nNo thing I did not like and it could do without is the random, out of place, big titty smash fight. If I wanted something like that I\\'d play one of those filthy weeb games. Also a little weird to promote the game as female protagonist but have something like that in the game.\\nAlso dying from simply touching a spike is annoying, but all in all 8/10. Very fun Metroidvania style gameplay combined with wonderful music score, colorful character and backround design also with surprisingly fluid combat mechanics makes this game a must play looks like an outdated nes game, feels like an outdated nes game, plays like an outdated nes game. good game This whole review could be summed up in 2 words.  Castlevania Lite.  Although the music is lacking and the difficulty is low it\\'s worth a grab on sale. bom jogo Honestly this is one of my favorite games ever!! The art, music, and story are so otherworldly and just all around beautiful. This game had me screaming, crying, cheering, and everything in between. As the game progresses, you\\'re really challenged to use all your abilities to your advantage. One thing I really like is the organic way you\\'re moved through the map. You\\'ll be on your way to one destination but find yourself discovering a whole new part of the map all together. Something I found most convenient about this game is how easy it is to navigate. You can spend more time playing the game than trying to figure out how to get around the menu.\\n\\n10/10 would play again and again!! This is quite the hidden gem if I do say so myself. A beautiful combination of fluid detailed pixel art, metroidvania and souls-like elements. Combat is tight and engaging, bosses are challenging but fair, carries a dark theme of hopelessness and death around it and sticks with it to the very end. You can see the effects of the curse in everyone you meet. My only nitpick is that its REALLY annoying when you die and you lose a lot of progress because you didnt save in some time, but thats my own fault, not the game\\'s, thats why its a nitpick.\\n\\nThis review was probably terrible, but this game is anything BUT. Absolutely recommended, fairly priced game, not too heavy in terms of memory space, and about 4 hours long if you dont bother exploring the math for extra collectibles and items (thats what I did, hence my 6 hours). Get it anytime, full price or not, just do it. Great game and worth playing Simply a fantastic and timeless game. \\nThe graphics are extremely gorgeous and highly-animated, with a very unique charm. The characters are very well-designed and memorable (Especially Lubella >w<), the Soundtrack is relaxing, the gameplay is sooo satisfying, i actually played 10 hours straight and the only achievement left is beating Insane Difficulty.\\nOverall a perfect metroidvania experience that everyone should play. 10/10 Very steep learning curve since the beginning was the hardest section imo. If you like dark souls difficulty and secrets this is your game! I kinda dreaded it at the beginning from dying so much, and from having to perfect every boss for the items, but when I got good the game felt great! short but good MOMODORA is either a mini-troid or a tuff-as-nails adventure game depending on your skill and difficulty settings, but how does it taste? Well, the combat is fun and light, the platforming is strong with good map design, and it has definitely got solid game-play balance with some lovely (if simple) design to boot. [i]Bonus points for playable cat[/i] (because it really is fun).\\n\\nThe story and theme, however, feel a little odd. The music and the setting try to be Dark Souls, but the parade of anime dolls and the bouncy pink blocks feel like... something else. And it\\'s hard to get into the story when the main protagonist is a silent stranger and the other characters literally don\\'t interact in any way. I like what it\\'s going for, but I never really bought in.\\n\\nStill, for $5.oo it\\'ll give you a nice escape for a weekend. If you can\\'t get enough of these quick-n-dirty adventure platform games (like me) MOMODORA will feel right at home in your collection. ★☆☆\\n Cute art and cool world, but the gameplay is super unpolished. An infinitely replayable game that manages to do everything I loved so much about Momodora 2 even better. The music, art, and overall atmosphere is amazing. It\\'s a fairly short game, but it\\'s replayability more than makes up for it. This is the only game that I\\'ve ever one hundred percented, and I\\'ve done it multiple times. I can only hope Minoria lives up to it\\'s lineage when I finally get around to playing it. Currently waiting for another game just like this one very short game, but totally worth the money Very good but somewhat short metroidvania with great art and solid gameplay. Really fun side scroll Very good game, and worth paying for. This game diverges from the previous Momodora games, which were more linear and similar to Cave Story. This time it\\'s more of a metroidvania. The world is very atmospheric and fun to explore, and has a Touhou-esque cast of anime girls. The art and animation are also very high-quality. \\nJust a warning, though: this game is pretty easy on normal difficulty, and pretty short. That\\'s not necessarily a bad thing, though. The shorter length makes the game more suited for multiple playthroughs, which based on the steam achievements is something that the devs probably intended. Also, given the game\\'s low price the short length isn\\'t really an issue.\\nIf you\\'re wondering whether this is a good place to start, this game is a prequel to the other games and you don\\'t really need to have any knowledge of the previous games\\'s stories. The first two games are freeware, though, so there\\'s not really any reason not to play them. It\\'s just not required.\\nI recommend this game to anyone who\\'s a fan of atmospheric exploratiion/metroidvania but not necessarily into hard-as-nails games, and also anybody who\\'s a fan of anime girls and cats. Its a very fun game! Very pretty and polished, the combat is simple but yet effective and challenging. The game is difficult to the point where you might smash your controller at a point, but it gets better with powerups, it reminded me of Dark Souls in a way, and I love it for that reason, but after completing it I don\\'t think I\\'d play it again. Just an overall fun game, I\\'d say. Simple and short Metroidvania that has tight controls.  It can be frustrating to lose progress after instant-death pits/spikes that you can fall into unfairly, but overall, it\\'s not too difficult.  The first two hours of the game are way more difficult than the rest of it for some reason, so don\\'t worry too much if you\\'re having a hard time at first.  The story is weirdly told and doesn\\'t really make much sense.  It\\'s still a good time for the few hours it takes to complete. Overall a good side scroller, it plays kind of slow for my personal taste, so if you like games with quick movement, you may not like it, I\\'d say it\\'s kind of over hyped, I got it half off and it was worth it for the enjoyment I got out of it. 8/10 Very nice\\n Really cool game! Interesting world, combat is simple but feels good, but the key point of this game is the ANIMATION in my opinion.\\nThe running and turning, the JUICE on the attack animations, everything just looks great.\\n\\n9/10 very recommended if you want a short-ish game I played for like 20 minutes a few years ago and dropped it as I found it boring. Boy am I glad I came back. Maybe I\\'ll go back to Hollow Knight too someday, but as of now, I enjoyed this game [i]way[/i] more than HK. \\n\\nThe only problem I had is the ending (light spoilers obviously). [spoiler]I got the bad ending on my playthrough because there was no indication throughout the game your choices would have any impact on the outcome (they actually don\\'t) or that there was something specific you had to do before beating the game. [i]Apparently[/i] you have to upgrade your magic leaf at this random windmill thing in order to win the final fight. When you walk up to the windmill, all you get is a picture of a box with no indication as to what it means or what you\\'re supposed to do.[/spoiler] So the ending really felt anticlimactic to me. \\n\\nAside from that, the gameplay loop is great, and most of the bosses have very balanced difficulty. It should only take you a couple tries to beat most of them.\\n\\nAlso the art is insanely beautiful. I really enjoyed this game. The story was cute and the atmosphere felt nice and immersive. The controls were really smooth and fun. The dodge mechanic worked really well and I enjoyed it a lot. \\n\\nI did struggle to get it to run smoothly on Linux, but after I switched my display from X11 to Wayland it ran just fine. So after 100%\\'d this game, I\\'ve decided to write this review.\\n\\n[b]Overview[/b]\\n\\nTo me this game seems to be a combination of Castlevania and Dark Souls, and a good one.\\nThe gloomy atmosphere, non-linear (metroidvania) gameplay, and Souls-like combat (maybe more like Bloodborne).\\n\\n[b]Art and Music[/b]\\n\\nThe pixel art is very well done, especially since the animations are smoothly hand-drawn, very pleasing to the eye.\\nAnd then the music, while it may not be the greatest, it does the job right, and some of them are quite memorable, especially the Pardoner\\'s Dance. I feel like a lot of people might agree that Fennel\\'s fight is the best part in the game.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay/Combat[/b]\\n\\nNormally, I don\\'t like metroidvanias that only has 1 type of main weapon. Although there are few exceptions, and one of them is definitely Momodora. The combat is satisfying enough to keep you entertained, you\\'re only equipped with a leaf (that plays like a sword) and a bow (which you can charge to shoot more arrows), either you want to play all melee, all ranged or mixed it\\'s all up to you, and of course there are items you can use to change your playstyle a bit. And just like other Souls-like games, dodging is important.\\nOverall it\\'s just fun to play.\\n\\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\\n\\nAt the beginning, you get to choose a difficulty, Easy, Normal, or Hard. \\nI\\'ve never played Easy but Normal was very well balanced for a first playthrough, until you get to a certain point where you\\'ve collected a bunch of Heart fragments (extra HP) and Bellflower (healing item), a lot of bosses would be too easy to beat, on my first playthrough (which was on Normal), most of the bosses are beaten after 2nd try, even the final boss wasn\\'t hard to beat.\\nI\\'d still recommend playing on Normal for a first playthrough and replay on Hard for a 100% run.\\nAlthough if you want a challenge on Normal I suppose you can go for the Imperishable and/or Pacifist run (never actually tried a New Game+ so I\\'m not sure if it adds difficulty or not, probably does).\\n\\nOn Hard there are extra enemies in some maps, and your Health is lower, sometimes you\\'d even die in one hit, but I feel like this is the difficulty where the game meant to be played on.\\nWhen you beat the game on Hard, the Insane difficulty will be unlocked, where everything basically just kills you in one hit, in the description it only says \"Don\\'t even try this\". I mean it\\'s up to you if you want to do this or not, but to me this was actually fun, I usually get frustrated when games gets too difficult but thanks to the fun combat, I don\\'t feel that at all.\\n\\nBut perhaps it\\'s not only about the combat, but also the save point placements. When you\\'re about to fight a boss, you don\\'t have to face like hundreds of enemies after leaving the save point, some of the save points are also placed right besides the boss room, so this game is quite kind on that matter.\\n\\n[b]Royal Pinacotheca[/b]\\n\\nYes I\\'m making an entire section dedicated to one area in the game. \\nMinor spoiler warning.\\n\\nThis area is accessible after you\\'ve obtained all 4 Crest Fragments, and to me this is just the Blighttown of Momodora. I mean it\\'s not that bad, but, I remember dying a lot in this place, maybe I\\'m just bad at the game but still. On top of that this game has the hardest boss in the game (in my opinion), Lupiar and Magnolia.\\nDespite all of that this is probably the most memorable place for me, probably a nightmare too.\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nOverall I just love this game, especially with the art, gloomy atmosphere, and satisfying combat. Fennel best boss, and screw you Royal Pinacotheca.\\n\\nI\\'m giving this game a 9/10.\\n\\nThank you for reading this. Short and sweet. Movement mechanics are satisfying, platforming and combat require some level of skill so it\\'s not a complete breeze. Bosses are sometimes pretty hard.\\n\\nAll around a good experience. Not extremely bad, but nothing to write home about. While the game is short, your time is probably best invested in other games. good game. wonderful. 10% able easily Bosses are hard as hell. But the game itself is really fun and a blast to play. hmm yes woman yes mm woman yes what a charming adventure. I had a great time exploring the nicely designed and varied paths. I liked the small taste of freedom in the early to mid-point of the adventure. The story kept interest and the characters\\' motivations surfed upon it like a batch of california raisins. Even some of the baddies had respectable depth.  I thought limiting the weaponry and using items/charms were well-implemented choices, but, being a wizard myself, I would have liked to see more spells (small gripe). I played on hard and it kept me going! Looking forward to the sequel.\\n8.5/10 Fantastic art style, Snappy controls. Fight with a leaf. 10/10\\nA fantastic metroidvania with a dark fantasy setting and crisp sprite artwork and an interesting story. One of my favourite games on steam! ♡ \\nI love this game <3 :momocat: :8bitheart: a very cute metroidvania with nice music and atmosphere I thought it was ok, but the save points were unfortunately very far between and added unnecessary time padding to the game rather than encourage a streamlined experience. Shortcuts to the boss after failed attempts would have been nice. What I\\'d like to see: \\n- Different areas on the map being different colours. When you\\'re hunting down the final bits and bobs it\\'s tough to know which save point to warp to because it\\'s all jumbled together as the one colour. Take a look at the in-game map design of Blasphemous. The sewers are brown. The ice mountains are blue. The woods are green, and so on. It makes looking at the map SO much easier on the eyes. \\n\\nThe animation is absolutely fantastic! Especially for Pardoner Fennel. \\nA solid experience. It\\'s nice to see this series evolve from Momodora 1 to 3 then this. This is like the culmination of everything we\\'ve seen so far and then some more. It\\'s the most similar to Momodora 2 with the open map exploration, unlike 1 and 2 which were linear and a more arcade-y design. This is definitely the right way the series needs to go. Great soundtrack. Art reminds me of ib. Game is trying to be Dark Souls but feels more like Blasphemous (which was trying to be Dark Souls). \\nIn summary, once again, a great game from rdein. Very little to pick at, other than what was mentioned above (which really isn\\'t a criticism but more like a suggestion for some quality of life that\\'s easily updated with a patch. Also, extra points for zettai ryouiki and boob boss)\\nLet\\'s hope we see Bunny Swordmaster in the next one! yes Definitely an amazing game. Combat is extremely satisfying, with all of your hits feeling powerful. The different passive and active items also add variety to the playstyles. Every upgrade is useful, and bossfights are great. Short but sweet game overall. I did enjoy this game, for what it is, but I don\\'t recommend it.\\n\\nThe reason for this is simply that the overall standard of the game is not at a high level, despite some aspects being very good. It looks like a game developer learning the ropes. It is clearly inspired by the Metroidvania genre, and makes a good attempt. It survives by keeping things quite simple, and it\\'s quite an interesting game if you have an interest in game development.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good attempt at a Metroidvania, and there are a lot of positives. But I can\\'t recommend it without the caveat that expectations must be kept low.\\n\\nPositives:\\n- Retro art style is quite beautiful in some areas, particularly the backgrounds in the forest.\\n- Music is nice and creates an atmosphere.\\n- Combat is generally good fun, and the bow and rolling works quite well.\\n- Warping and many save points alleviates some frustration\\n- Map is good enough to get you through\\n- Cheap when on sale, and not a bad play if you set your expectations low\\n\\nNegatives:\\n- Overall lack of polish\\n   - The map is very basic. Some indication of different areas would have been less frustrating.\\n   - The jumping/swimming sprites are static\\n   - The level design wasn\\'t great. The only items that helped you progress were keys, and all locked doors looked the same, regardless of the key needed.\\n- The story telling is extremely poor. Who the characters were, what they were called, what was happening, all of this was absent. Things happen to characters, and I don\\'t know who they are and don\\'t have any reason to care.\\n- Everything in this game seems to be an anime girl with cat ears. I\\'m sure anyone who can make those lovely backgrounds can design more consistent and original enemies. Screenshots of Lubella should have been sufficient warning. Nice little metroidvania. I love the sprite work and the music! This is a beautiful game that has a rewarding difficulty curve. Great Game. played for like 4 hours.\\n Really fun for a few hours of styled pixel art, great atmospheric music and simple gameplay, totally worth it. . Rather short, but the music and art are great and there\\'s a strong sense of exploration with how open and unguided the level design is. Good looking and sounding, but quite annoyng in terms of gameplay at some moments and the small storyline isn\\'t interesting enough to keep it going \"Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight\" is a masterpiece in every aspect the game has to offer you. It\\'s challenging, great artwork & music,  intriguing story that isn\\'t too much to go through like nice short and suttle. \\n\\nThe game can feel strenuous and will make you stuck on parts of the playthrough. It\\'s part of the experience, get through it with a bit of tryhard and feel yourself getting slowly better at the game, and of course, the relief of you succeeding that part. It\\'s worth it.\\n\\nThe only thing that I would have liked to see in the game was a genual hint towards the possible endings, to achieve one of the 2. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is one of my favorite games of all time. \\nI know it says i only have around 4 hours on it, but that is because my old computer was really really bad and couldn\\'t run it well, so I got it on the Switch a while ago, and realized \"oh wait i never reviewed this game.\"\\nThis game is short. its only around 4 hours to beat on your first playthrough. while this seems like it would be kind of a bad thing, due to its price tag of 10 bucks, it isnt. The length is perfect. It adds a lot of replayability for the game. This, coupled with the dozens of secrets to find, including bosses, makes every playthrough of the game strategic, and lets you plan what you want to do in this run. I myself am not a fan of metroidvanias. at all. but this game makes me want to play over and over again. \\nNow that the fifth in the series is on its way, i feel like it\\'s the perfect time to play this, the fourth one. \\n\\nat its WORST i would give this game a 9/10, but as a whole, i give this game a 10/10. very good game, metrovaniaesque I liked this game and would recommend it.  It\\'s good looking, simple but difficult, and comfy.  It is rather short all together if you fly through it, but I could see myself playing it again. A nice cutesy platform adventure. Sleek controls and super crisp art gives the game a really polished feel. While the story isn\\'t too deep, the variety of characters you meet makes the world feel compelling. Music is alright. You rarely encounter games where almost every aspect is polished \"just right\", with no added sugar. The downside to that is though, that some people yearn more. Something that goes beyond the average. Maybe that\\'s why the game feels a bit shallow at the same time. All that said, I do still heartily recommended trying this out! Cute and short game, with the ability to choose how you feel like playing it. Wanna breeze through the bosses with your heal items? Go for it. Want to try and beat the bosses flawlessly for some bonuses? You\\'re pretty crazy but you can do it!\\n\\nMany secrets, many challenges, many cute girls to meet on your adventure. I\\'d pick up this little gem on sale if you like metroidvanias. Yeah, I like metroidvania games. In this one you get to play as a cute priestess who purifies things with a magic leaf, so that\\'s a huge plus. Great game. I love how every new installment of the Momodora series improves over the last. really good. come back rdein we miss you :( Cute. Nice music. Great pixel art. New Game +. Buy it, it\\'s worth it. Really cute, I just regret not buying the soundtrack too. Maybe later. I played this game on the easy level and it still was kind of challenging for me, to be honest. The achievements are hard to receive as well, but at least got some trading cards. I\\'m replaying it for the second time now and hopefully getting a good ending since my first attempt failed. Overall nice game, cute graphics and charming music, REALLY reminds me of Undertale *felt like if Undertale was a platformer*... but still I can\\'t imagine playing in a harder mode :) Momodora is one of those games that you enjoy playing from start to finish. If you like metroidvania gameplay and repeating trial-and-error gamestyle. Yep. This game is must buy. For people who are unsure about those two. It can be little frustrating when you get an item after 4 minutes of gaming and then you noticed that your life is low. Now you need to backtrack that same 4 minutes + additional minutes for the closest bell. If you can\\'t or you get cheap shot\\'d in your way. Tough luck. Game takes everything what you had collected and then just asks you to do the same twice.\\n\\nIt\\'s alright when you get used it, but I feel like the bells placements are sometimes too far apart. Yes, you can collect those Health Herbs on the game, but sadly those sometimes deplete so fast that the game just forces your deaths sometimes.\\n\\nGame\\'s story is pretty meh. Nothing special and feels mundane D&D style, \"Go and kill this person\" -type of quest. Controls in other hand feel awkward. 50% of my deaths was because I accidentally either pressed Item Selection, Bow or Dash instinctly. My finger would have been pretty sure that  Back Trigger [ L2 and R2] -Buttons should for cycling items. Left Trigger [L1] would be for item activation and Right Trigger [R1] for the bow. Dash and Item activation doesn\\'t change on the control menu unless you reroute your controller\\'s macro buttons from the Steam menu. Which can be a hassle for people who just wants to re-map their preferable control method.\\n\\nGame is solid three hour fun, but there is too much unnecessary deaths. I would have played it more if there was additional content in it after last boss. [spoiler] Secret Boss - not worth for trying it [/spoiler] Great game. The game is not too bad, but it\\'s missing something critical.\\n\\nArt and music are pretty, controls are nice and tight. You can play as a [spoiler]cute cat[/spoiler]!\\n\\nBut it doesn\\'t feel like a metroidvania - unlocking new ability doesn\\'t lead to whole new sections of map, only if linearly, and there\\'s not much reason to ever backtrack (making all my efforts feel like waste of time).\\n\\nBoss fights are simple and aren\\'t any what memorable, except maybe the slightly \"lewd\" one - just for the unusual hurtbox location. On a contrary, regular enemies hurt a lot, and there\\'re also annoying insta-kill spikes/pits.\\n\\nOnce you die, everything since last checkpoint is reset so you need to pick up recent secrets again..\\n\\nAs of story, maybe there\\'s a lot of hidden stuff, but casually reading all dialogues left me with impression that the story can be summarized in one short sentence.\\n\\nOverall the game feels.. hollow.\\n\\nI can only recommend to grab the game when it\\'s on sale if you wanna run in a pretty and simple platformer, just don\\'t expect much from the game beyond its looks. I\\'ve played all the games in the Momodora series and this one is really good, my only problem is that normal mode feels harder than it should be, in the first Momodora there was no choosing difficulty, it just starts. If i had to rank these games from worst to best, just because its the worst doesn\\'t mean its bad, it would look like this\\n4.Momodora I\\n3.Momodora III\\n2.Momodora II\\n1.Momodora RUTM Cute game :) In theory good game in praxis too many Instant Death spikes, pits and attacks to be enjoyable. If you have to redo the same room 5 times because an enemy attack knocks you slightly back into spikes then any game becomes frustrating Great 2D Metroidvania Souls-like game. The dark theme looks awesome, great boss fight along with nice soundtrack, my complain would be that it is too short and the bosses are not very challenging even in hard mode Ø hit run. A very nice little game for metroidvania fans. Hard mode is can be frustrating at first with bosses but it is the difficutly I recommend. The boss patterns are telegraphed so it wont be too hard. The soundtrack and sprite work is beautiful. Quite relaxing despite getting lost once and dying semi frequently. The game might be hard at first, but it truly is worth it. I\\'ve never played any of the other momodora games, so  I feel like I\\'m missing out. Nonetheless, this game flows wonderfully. There is no bad mechanics in it. It is all about skill and memory. Even though it can be short, it still is quite enjoyable. I just (as of 9/27/2020 at 4:30-ish PM) finally 100%ed it. It has been a go-to game for me to play while I\\'m waiting on other people or if I\\'m twitch streamers. Also, got the True Ending on Insane difficulty. If you do combos appropriately, you can be VERY powerful. Somewhat want to do one last run and not use the bow or any spells, but if I do, it DEFINITELY wont be on Insane Difficulty. Probably on Hard. Phenomenal aesthetic combination of a beautifully dark world and cute characters, fantastic animations, hidden secrets, and satisfying gameplay with fair challenges and snappy controls Been one of my favourite games for years now. I love the graphics, story telling, and variety of enemy designs. I highly recommend this game for literally anyone. Me diverti mucho, muy buen juego (Jugue mi primera vez en Dificil, nose si eso afecte). Gameplay - This is a tightly coded Metroidvania in the classic tradition. Explore, fight, gain new abilities, etc. It varies a bit from the usual formula by mixing in some Soulslike elements, notably a Eustice flask style healing system.\\n\\nThe controls are extremely satisfying (essential for this genre). You rarely feel like you\\'re waiting for an animation to finish.\\n\\nGameplay is overall about 7-10 hours, depending on how thorough you are. Personally I\\'m delighted that it\\'s short. Longer games can easily overstay their welcome.\\n\\nMy only real complaint is the map. It would\\'ve been nice if the map regions were labeled, and nicer still if we could\\'ve added our own notes. The warp ability doesn\\'t let you pick any save-point, just one per region that\\'s pre-designated.\\n\\nPresentation - Retro pixel art style. The overall presentation is a mix of dark and cute. It serves decently, and provides a good callback to other Metroidvanias. There\\'s a few interesting vistas, but most of the tilesets are same-y. This isn\\'t a game I\\'d recommend on art alone, but the art does add to the experience.\\n\\nThe protagonist is female, which is good, we could use more games with female leads, and while her animations are a bit cutesy, she\\'s at least never sexualized.\\n\\nSpeaking of goofy sexualization; My only complaint is the Witch of Decay. You get into several fights with this enormous witch... and her breasts. Seriously. They have their own impact/jiggle animation. It\\'s completely out-of-touch with the rest of the game\\'s presentation and tone.\\n\\nStory - Minimalistic and pretty typical for this kind of game. The kingdom has been cursed. Go face the source of the curse and either defeat or free them from it. It\\'s more of a framing device than an actual plot. That said, I appreciate that it takes itself seriously. Indy projects too often aim for \"funny\" plots instead of serious ones. The writing is rarely up to the challenge.\\n\\nInnovation - There\\'s nothing new here, but what\\'s been included has been refined to a razor (leaf?) edge. Momodora is a good example of how a game doesn\\'t have to innovate to be worthwhile.\\n\\nConclusion - A nicely self-contained Metroidvania that\\'s absolutely worth your time IF you\\'re a fan of the genre and looking for more of the same. Definitely skippable if you\\'re not a Metroidvania fan. If you\\'ve never played this style of game, then Momodora is a great entry-point. It\\'s short and highly accessible, which can\\'t be said for all games of this type. A short, though charming little game. Momodora is a prequel to an indie game series about priests, witches, and undead powers. I had previously played Minoria before this; a spinoff inspired by the series, so I was familiar with its Metroidvania-esque gameplay, combat system, and atmosphere. I think this game is a little slower, and less challenging overall; but it has some of its own appeal in its environments and straightforward design. Minoria had a totally different artstyle, though it used some of the same motifs, and whereas I think that worked really well, the pixelated areas and characters in this game still look great. The story isn\\'t anything special; and the music is pretty good. \\n\\nEssentially it\\'s just a 2D timing/attack action game, where you have to dodge correctly, choose between range and melee, and navigate a simple maze. There\\'s some unlockables on the way, but I find that some of the sorceries aren\\'t useful, or don\\'t come into practice until the final hour, so you mainly just rely on your bow and \"leaf,\" which acts sort of like a sword. One of my favourite elements is you can turn into a cat, but there isn\\'t that many puzzles, and I found the game to be kind of easy outside of boss fights. Even then, there\\'s enough healing items that if you do get hit, you can kind of power through combat. I\\'d generally recommend you play on Hard, unless this is one of the first games of the style you\\'re attempting. \\n\\nIf you have a craving for sprite adventures, this is an excellent game to pick up; and though it won\\'t last a long time, it\\'s polished enough that it may draw you into the series, or inspire you to tackle other games in the genre. How to play momodora 101\\nStep 1: Flex on enemies by beating them to death with a leaf\\nStep 2: Become cat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 3: FLEX ON ENEMIES HARDER BY BEATING THEM TO DEATH WITH A LEAF AS A CAT h Good pixel art but poor combat ruins it, the bosses have way too much health and an extremly boring moveset most of the time the boss just attacks a random spot instead of targetting you, meaning your fight will consist of you spamming your bow for 15 minutes hoping that you dont happen to get hit Great little platformer, great speed running content. Hopefully they make more! Loved it, great atmosphere and story! Getting used to the keyboard inputs is kinda tricky, controller is recommended. A decent metroidvania, altough i don\\'t really play these games that often, this game was a pleasant experience (for the most part). As it has that level of difficulty that isn\\'t too stressful, and gives satisfaction to yourself when you manage to beat a boss or the game itself.\\nIt took me 12 hours to get all achievements, mostly because I played all difficulties and took my time to look for the secrets (gave up and looked up a guide lol)\\nSomething i don\\'t really like is how you can\\'t really land a meele combo most of the time because you take damage when you touch most enemies, so you\\'re most likely going to use arrows most of the time.\\n\\nIt\\'s still a great game, a bit frustrating, but enjoyable. True cat girl experience. Nice gameplay and beautiful pixel art. Would love to play more if a sequel come out Decent, but has about 4 hours of content, so just make sure you have the right expectations. Disclaimer: My scores/reviews are almost always based on having bought the game at close to the \"lowest historical price\" on steam at time of purchase.\\n\\nQuick score: 5/5 This game didn\\'t really do it for me. Admittedly, I did not get very far. The environment is very souls inspired and the pixel art is nice. But the game loop itself left something to be desired.\\n\\nThe death mechanic is extremely punishing, since if you haven\\'t passed a save point for a while you lose a lot of progress. Unlike Dark Souls, where this encourages you to optimize your combat on the way to your death location, there is no recovering lost \"souls\" in this game. There is also a severe dearth of interesting nooks and crannies to explore. It\\'s just sorta samey metroidvania rooms you\\'re passing through.\\n\\nThe other issue I had was that, unlike Dark Souls, the combat is extremely easy and there is no reason to become better at it. The bosses I fought did not present any challenge, and the normal monsters can only hit you through carelessness. To make up for this, the game seems to increase the \"difficulty\" by having every enemy that even touches you do hilarious damage.\\n\\nDefinitely wanted to like this one but it didn\\'t grab me. Game is good, music is boppin, rewards for killing bosses without taking damage. Interesting art style, and its one of the better metroidvanias I\\'ve played. https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/ Excellent metroidvania game. Makes you feel like you\\'re playing a SNES game, in a good way. The game is fun and fair, exploration is rewarded and the animations are clean. A really good game that’s worth it’s price.\\n\\n[h1] =Overview= [/h1]\\n   Kinda difficult controls, simple story with astonishing art and an amazing soundtrack. The overall atmosphere set by it is one of a souls-like game, coming around with the theme pretty nicely, making a pleasureful experience.\\n\\n[h1] =Story= [/h1]\\n   Not much to talk about this one, the hero is confronted with a problem, goes on an adventure to solve it, fight some people and then… problem solved! [spoiler] Or not? [/spoiler]\\n   In short, a priestess from a far away land goes on a journey to stop a curse that’s plaguing her home. \\n\\n[h1] =Art & Audio= [/h1]\\n   Beautifully made pixel graphics for both characters and backgrounds. The NPCs and PC are well designed, having their own highlight on the game levels. Animations are a strong point for it, none of them seems wacky and are super fluid.\\n   The impact that the soundtrack has on overall gameplay is undeniable. More than once it helped to emphasize the mood of the area or encounter, the audio effects play an important role on it as well. Momodora RUTM’s ost is pleasant to hear not only in game but also out of it, ranging from lively and tense songs to calm and depressing ones.\\n\\n[h1] =Gameplay= [/h1]\\n   Oh boy! Something I can’t forget to say is how awful the keyboard controls are for this game. Unless you have no bones on your fingers, a controller is highly recommended. It could be better if it had mouse support; The attack, use/change item, jump and dodge buttons being so close doesn’t feel nice and are often very confusing.\\n   The game presents you 4 difficulties, providing from casual to hardcore experiences. Changing how hard the game is don’t seem to change the enemies, only the player, lowering or increasing health and letting you regenerate it over time with equipped items.\\n   Melee or ranged, combat is good, bad thing is that you can get hit if you’re too close to an enemy or boss when attacking. It really improves itself by using the items the game gives you, especially during boss fights, those are really cool but, on the other hand they could have used of a bigger attack pallet.\\n   All achievements can be gotten by the second play-trough, although it can be challenging. It really disappointed me that some enemies are able to enter boss rooms, which could fairly easy ruin some runs.\\n   Don’t having a linear obligatory way to progress trough and having the ability to warp between save points are a nice touch that’s worth a mention. A really wonderful 2-D platformer with enough challenge to keep things interesting. It was never frustrating to play through which is always a plus. Overall, this game feels quite nice to play. The atmosphere is great, combat mechanics are easy to get into and the bossfights are fair.\\n\\nCompletionist\\'s view: Some achievements are related to bosses, some are related to collectibles. And then there is the no-death run, the pacifist run and the highest difficulty run. These are nice challenges. Excellent souls-like metroidvania game with a fair deal of difficulty.  Easy to pick up and fun to master.  Controls are good and the gameplay doesn\\'t feel clunky.  You will die a few times, especially if you\\'re trying to defeat bosses without taking damage so you can get special items.  Definitely recommend.  Game has best balance of difficulty when played on hard mode since you can still get one-shot, but not by every single enemy like you can on insane mode.  Insane difficulty is a lot of fun too though, but I can see how it would be frustrating to some. Played it on hard mode and had a lot of fun. The story was sweet and the fights always kept me on my toes. great game\\n This game is just too good, loved it. Waiting for the next one. Simple story but good, easy to learn mechanic\\n\\nConclusion : Good Game Metroidvania\\nAdditional : Kaho is waifu Pros\\n\\nCombat feels nice\\nFirst two bosses are designed really well, final boss was decent\\nAtmosphere is nice\\nEnemies aren\\'t covered in acid while you\\'re doing a normal combo on them\\nLot of character emotions conveyed correctly in the game\\nThe developer actually cares about the game\\nI didn\\'t hit a glitch\\nCharacter animates well\\n\\nCons\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of quality of life improvements that are missing that are present in other platformers\\nConfused as to characters plot arcs/ they feel too short\\nIt feels like your just traveling through and hard to get attached to anyone emotionally\\nNo fullscreen/ limited resolution options\\nThe music made it feel like there wasn\\'t any music in a lot of places\\n\\n\\nOverall:\\nIt was pleasant and I was able to learn a few things game design wise. It\\'s a game, and I want to do a lot with it to improve it since it feels almost awesome. Like it\\'s close. I didn\\'t like the part where I was killing children, but I did like the part where I was hitting B**bs. 10/10 best game confirmed.\\n\\nLoved It at this price!\\n\\n My Favorite Game of All Time! The story is great, game play is smooth, and the music is the best I\\'ve ever heard in a video game. The bosses are challenging but not unbeatable, its fair. I definitely recommend this game to everyone. Really cute metroidvania.\\nArtstyle reminds me a lot of cave story which I love.\\nKinda short, but very fun.\\n Lubella pog The art-style and the fact that i can turn into a lil cat make my serotonin levels skyrocket :3 a crazy side scroller with great pixel graphics and creepy monsters Pretty solid metroidvania with an artstyle which appears to be a mixture of touhou and tumblr\\n Beautiful game.\\nThe pixel art is breathtaking, and the gameplay is tight. The music is atmospheric and haunting, and the world is very isolating.\\n\\nThis is a nice, though short Metroidvania. You have your map, your short ranged and long ranged weapons, and a few key items to create a slightly customized build. There are some nice secrets to find, and the exploration is fast and rewarding. Movement upgrades don\\'t make you go crazy and zip around the map, but they offer you a way to mix up your attack plan and evasion tactics.\\n\\nThe game pulls some clear elements and inspirations from the Souls games, however it is nowhere near reaching that level of difficulty. Enemies and bosses are very telegraphed, therefore learning to beat them is quite intuitive and easy. It is very comparable to the normal bosses of Hollow Knight. It all pulls together in a nice and very fair challenge.\\n\\nI\\'d recommend this game to anyone who\\'s looking for a good Metroidvania, though be warned that this game only takes a few hours to finish nearly to completion. There are multiple difficulties and challenges, so that may keep one occupied. good game had to leaf a review Play this game if;\\nyou love amazingly styled pixel art and levels\\nyou like amazingly produced atmospheric music\\nYou like non-linear, really hard hack and slashers\\nyou like \\'vania style secrets\\nyou like not too much platforming but enough to fill out the world\\nyou like bosses that deal a half of your health with each hit while you have to meekly chisel away at their full screen heath bar with a maple leaf\\n\\nComplete with the silent protagonist this game feels like what I wanted from Hyper Light Drifter (a game I liked, but maybe not as much as this)\\n\\nThis game is hard, it has an easy mode and I am sure it is easier but normal is the kinda game were every boss will kill you many times before you get it.\\n\\nMy only deduction of points is that i feel like Lubella doesn\\'t really fit thematically or artistically in the game at all, yet she of all bosses is in it twice. It tastes like obligatory anime fan service, mostly so the artist can have some sex appeal on the poster and we can have giant tittied woman who\\'s tits you have to smack around for a while.\\n\\nbut seriously, you get to be a cat so it kinda makes up for this. All games should allow us to play as the cat. Masterpiece.\\n\\nLevel and difficulty design was just perfect for me. Very nice metroidvania, definitely recommended. Its alright \\nJust needed more weapon variety Weirdest game of all times. It\\'s pretty damn good you should get it I was given this as a gift.\\n\\nIn advance, I don\\'t hate the game. I don\\'t think it\\'s bad. Unfortunately, I don\\'t think it\\'s that great either due to a lot of weird/bad design decisions, a bit of missing polish and the fact that it really didn\\'t need to be a Metroidvania. I don\\'t really care to play the harder difficulties as a result because I think these issues compound into a game I just find frustrating. I find it overrated and was very disappointed when I finally tried it after seeing all the praise, but if you like it, more power to you.\\n\\nFirst off, the combat has some issues.\\nWhile at first the melee seems pretty nice and weighty, with every move pushing you forward - the cracks start to show when you realize the game has contact damage and it\\'s really easy to get knocked out of a combo just from that. While it looks like for the most part staggering an enemy with a melee hit will stop it from contact damaging you, if anything\\'s nearby that wasn\\'t staggered, it\\'ll hit you out of your combo. You seemingly get no i-frames, even during your finisher.\\n\\nThis is especially a thing during the final boss, which doesn\\'t seem to stagger - you\\'ll try to wail on her and you just get knocked back for no good reason. Most humanoid bosses do stagger, but they can break out of it too. This wouldn\\'t be so bad - I\\'m used to it from playing KH2FM - but the problem is that damn contact damage. It\\'s usually not a lot, but it\\'s still frustrating. You really just have to shorten your combos or try and judge the distance you can use a finisher on some of these.\\n\\nThere are no real aerial combos either, so after a while I just ended up saying \"screw it\" and used ranged attacks for most of my damage. This leads to some of the taller bosses just getting really stale and repetitive (like, again, final boss) because all you\\'re doing is hopping and hitting over and over and over.\\n\\nSecond - the other main problem I have is that this game just really didn\\'t need to be a Metroidvania. It\\'s kind of a Fusion-like - there\\'s not a ton of interconnectivity and exploration involved. It\\'s also a bit more like an Igavania, with kinda obtuse secrets that\\'ll leave you constantly hitting walls with your leaf. I don\\'t mind either style of \\'vania, and I think it\\'s just the execution that matters.\\n\\nSo unfortunately, I really didn\\'t feel like exploration was all that rewarding - the damage is so high even on normal that health pickups kind of felt pointless, a lot of your equipment is either bought or gained from flawless boss fights, and there\\'s only really two upgrades that gate your progress (ignoring the actual shards themselves, which basically make up a key). It takes really damn long to get a fast travel ability - while the map isn\\'t very large, it\\'s still large enough to make backtracking to far away areas tedious.\\n\\nThe level design also does a few things that just really don\\'t make sense to me. There\\'s a few dead end rooms that seem like they would have something there, but don\\'t. There\\'s also a couple of these rooms that have water in them that will kill you if you fall in - which makes zero sense when the game has a water level that lets you dive right in without so much as an oxygen meter. I also have to question why there\\'s instant kill spikes in a Metroidvania game with sometimes pretty long stretches between save points. Usually, MVs with instant kill spikes have some kind of grace element that makes these deaths less painful - Ori 1 had checkpoints you could make yourself, and Mega Man ZX (not one you hear often I bet) had a lives system.\\n\\nThere\\'s other nitpicks I have but I just wanted to get my main points across and that\\'s it really. I feel like a lot of the problems I had with the game just carried over into Minoria from what I\\'ve seen, which got significantly less praise than this for whatever reason. I hope that the next Momodora game that was just announced learns its lessons from this, Minoria and its peers to win me over. Otherwise, this is why I just didn\\'t enjoy my time with Momodora: RUTM. yes The only thing I didn\\'t like was the painfully long frames when you hit something, meaning you could get attacked during your attack. Some bosses were pretty bs. Good game though. Yeah, no. I don\\'t think so. This medtroidvania is just too frustrating because of the stone age design of the save points, the outdated designs made for boss dialogue handling and save points placements, and the clunky combat. The reason the review score is so high is because fanboys of previous momodora titles constitute the overwhelming quantity of reviewers for this game. There\\'s also an issue in that there is no option for normal difficulty. The only options are easy, nintendo hard (this is called \"normal\" in the game but it isn\\'t), and impossible (this one is called hard).\\n\\nBuy Touhou project luna nights instead (it\\'s a metroidvania despite what the name may have you believe) This game is the Chrono Trigger of Metroidvanias: A short game that is finely crafted and perfectly replayable. \\n\\nThe only problem I have with this game is somewhat stringent limitations on warping from save point to save point, but it didn\\'t hamper my experience whatsoever.\\n\\nIt only took me 4 hours to beat this game, but I can absolutely see myself playing this again and again!\\n Solid Metroidvania with some good bosses, and reasonably intelligently laid out areas.\\n\\nIt\\'s not exactly innovative in any way, but I don\\'t mind; it feels like the definition of a good game that doesn\\'t excel at anything, but doesn\\'t really fail at anything, either. Only problem I can think of is that the damage initially felt a bit high, but it felt fine later in the run after grabbing more vitality upgrades, (This was on normal difficulty, btw.) Overall, it\\'s just inoffensively good without being amazing; if you want to play a Metroidvania, you could do far, far, far worse than this. Would absolutely recommend it if you like the genre and want to play more of it. If you asked me what the best metroidvania that is neither a Castlevania nor Metroid game is, this game is one of the first the comes to mind for me. Don Vito Corleone\\'s love ^‿^ A fun and simple side-scrolling game.\\n\\nControls are easy to understand. Upgrades that make the game much more fun (and a bit easier). Even though the artsyle is really simple and pixelated, you can still feel the impact from the damage you inflict. It\\'s one of the things that I like about this sort of games.\\n\\nI believe that\\'s all I have to say for this game. The game is straight forward and rather simple, for a game of this type it it a good introduction to games like hollow knight. I do wish it was more involved though, as there isn\\'t really any secrete info or side story of any consequence.\\n tight control, fun exploration.\\n\\nsome annoying design choices (sometimes you can swim, sometimes you just drown? and sometimes enemies don\\'t hurt when you touch \\'em, sometimes they do), but overall solid 2 D gaming, short and sweet.\\n\\nstory is also kind of weak (had little idea why i was doing stuff.  then again i did not play the previous versions), but still would recommend. The dark theme of the game\\'s story blends in really well with its difficulty.\\nThe graphics are aesthetically pleasing. The different locations have a nice feel to them and blend well with the soundtrack. \\nPlatforming and combat is great leading to a satisfying metroidvania experience.\\nThis game was one of my first metroidvanias and it was really a good starting point to the genre.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a great game ❤︎ A fairly simple metroidvania with intense boss battles with a bit of a 2D Dark souls vibe, could use a bit more items and new abilities to unlock but the pixel art and animations are amazing :)\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to see what we\\'re playing next with regular updates, or request to review a game, feel free to follow us at: \\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35688508-Ember-Works-Reviews/ level design is excellent, teaches you the game as you go with the game itself not just a tutorial. power ups are feel awesome when you get them but do not make you any less easy to kill thats for sure. fun little challenge. mind you i also love hollow knight and this feels similar to that game. Really enjoyed playing gameplay is great. The art is superb. Fennel Best boss, RIP Cath :\\'( I love this game, i play it from time to time again and again in loop Any fan of the metroidvania genre should try this. It\\'s pixel art, it\\'s metroidvania to its core, it has wonderful atmosphere,... The combat is tough, but fair. You will die, but never will it feel unfair. Finishing this game was an absolute joy and this is one of those titles that I will come back to from time to time. I feel that the metroidvania games in the genre work best as deep, pixel art, atmospheric experiences. And Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is exactly that. \\n\\nAnd you can play as a cat! Nice game 10/10 I would have sex with this game It would be a must-have if I felt like they put the same effort into the second half of the game as they did the first. Huge silent parts that discontinue the atmosphere effect and make you check to  see if your speakers are still on. It\\'s a great game, I only wish it was as vibrant the whole way through.\\n\\n [spoiler] :momocat: ♡ [/spoiler] If you enjoy Castlevania you\\'ll probably enjoy this as well good shit My only complaint is that the game is too short, which is a good thing to complain about. I wan\\'t more of this amazing world! This is my first game in the momodora series, and you can bet that I\\'m buying the others! The art style is beautiful, the characters are charming, and the somber atmosphere just leaves me wondering about the lore and the deeper aspects of this world. I can\\'t get enough of this game, and I\\'ll likely be playing through it several more times before I\\'m done. One of my top favorite games, I highly recommend it. Also, bombservice, if you\\'re reading this, how dare you make me sad at the end there! Very nice soundtrack, excellent learning curve of all the mechanics, not too hard to play overall on any difficulty, graphics although not very detailed I feel fit the atmosphere of the game just right, took me 20 hours to achieve and get everything so think of it as a short and sweet experience, story is quite simple as well, seeing as its a sort of prequel to the other games of the series. Good buy overall. Rating: 3/5\\nThe game is too short and not worth the price. Wait until it\\'s on sale. \\nTotal gameplay 1st time was about 4hours on normal. \\n---------------------\\nPros:\\nPretty, if you\\'re into 2d artwork\\nMusic, while nothing memorable it was very atmospheric at times. \\nPolished, it is complete with some minor replayability and new game+. \\n-------------------------\\nCons:\\n\\nShort. Way too short. \\n\\nPower scaling was off balance. The beginning, while I was getting used to controls was by far the hardest. Comparatively, end game, when I\\'d finally learned the game, felt breezy easy and too short. If you\\'re looking for \"dark souls\", look elsewhere. \\n\\nCombat: Either snipe out of bounds or get in close before they hit. Little variety in how you approach combat. Often I would get locked in a swing animation and would be unable to turn around quick enough. Not having a down jump attack is something you\\'ll regret not being given.\\n\\nBosses could be accomplished in under five times. Very easy and they could be summarized as spam bow from the corners. Also, I\\'m not sure if I missed it, but there was no lore for half the bosses...they just appear at inconvenient times. \\n\\nLore, I\\'ll admit, I didn\\'t play the first three and I felt like I was severely missing a chunk on the protagonist\\'s back story. If you\\'re looking for \"dark souls, no questions answered\" kinda lore, look elsewhere.\\n\\nItems and money: Unless I ground a ton, I never had enough money to buy all the new item/buffs. As I progressed I kept feeling like I had to go back and buy out the merchant...but I was never given the chance.\\n\\nBacktracking: Warp comes in way too late in the game and most of the time you\\'re just wandering between health upgrades trying not to die before reaching the next save.\\n Finally got around halfway through this game and so far I\\'m enjoying it.\\n\\nI originally bought the game in October 2016 but never really touched it around the time or played it too much although according to steam I spent 1.5 hours on it I never got past the 2nd area of the game (The Dark Town) and stopped playing it for other games at the time.\\n\\nI did the same thing to Rabi-Ribi back in 2016 which is another Metroidvania, Now with Momodora, I bought the game on PS4 recently a 2nd time despite the fact I already owned it on PC. \\n\\nI decided to play through the game on PS4 and so far I\\'m enjoying it. I will probably be doing a 2nd Steam playthrough at some point as I do with a lot of PC/PS4 games.\\n\\nNow the actual game itself is fairly short in comparison to other metroidvanias however the pixel art and animations in this game are really clean and the music itself is very relaxing. (White leaf memorial park especially.)\\n\\nI don\\'t really have much else to say though at the very least I have been enjoying the game so far. At first i didn\\'t like the game but after coming back to it and forcing myself through it, the game grew to me. It\\'s definitely an awesome game, the story is enjoyable and the combat is challenging but still fun. Ended up playing the game in one sitting and was worth the time, I highly recommend it. everything Nice Metroidvania Platformer\\nTrue Ending is lit. I previously gave this game a really scolding review, but then I beat four of the last bosses first try, so now I like it. \\n\\nBut really though, it\\'s not the best. The level design is so incredibly shitty, and many of the environment choices make no sense. The bosses are also repetitive and uninteresting. There\\'s no proper exposition so I don\\'t really care for the story. NPCs aren\\'t fun to talk to and don\\'t mean anything. Not really a memorable experience.\\n\\nAlthough I will say one thing: excellent soundtrack. [list]\\n[*]Spikes kill you instantly\\n[*]Water either kills you instantly, or you can swim through it, you never know\\n[*]Dodging kinda sucks and if you dodge into a spike pit you\\'re dead\\n[/list]\\n\\nIt\\'s a charming game for sure, very beautiful with an atmospheric soundtrack, but also difficult due to the insta-kill spikes and the dodge mechanic. But I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s a bad game, you can get your fun\\'s worth out of it. This is a quick and fun Metroidvania A Metroidvania with perfect pacing which makes the time fly by. Short but sweet and every second is enjoyable which few games of the genre can say. The game is unforgiving.  The early parts of the game I felt were very difficult as someone who does not play this genre often.  Enemies hit like a truck, instakill spikes, and you retry back to your last save point.  Brutal. \\n However, once I got the hang of the combat and how to use my power-ups, I started to play with a lot more confidence.  It\\'s a game that you have to get better as you play in order to beat it, and I found myself enjoying the game a lot more as I played and my skills improved.  Absolutely would recommend. *My reviews do consider the significance of gameplay, story, music, etc. before I assign a score (e.g. walking simulators don\\'t have much emphasis on gameplay, but I wouldn\\'t let that reflect negatively on the individual game being reviewed).\\n\\n===[Audience]=== ☐Kids ☐Everyone ☑Casual players ☑Pro players\\n\\n===[Graphics]=== ☐Bad ☐OK ☐Good ☑Beautiful ☐Masterpiece\\n\\n===[Gameplay]=== ☐Bad ☐OK ☐Good ☑Beautiful ☐Masterpiece\\n\\n===[Story]=== ☐Bad ☑OK ☐Good ☐Beautiful ☐Masterpiece\\n\\n===[Music/Sound]=== ☐Bad ☐OK ☐Good ☑Beautiful ☐Masterpiece\\n\\n===[Price/quality]=== ☑Full price ☐Wait for sale ☐Don\\'t do it\\n\\n===[Requirements]=== ☑Minimum ☐Average ☐High end\\n\\n===[Difficulty]=== ☐Very Easy ☐Easy ☑Medium ☐Hard ☐Very Hard\\n\\n===[Game Time/Length]=== ☐Very Short ( 0 - 2 hours) ☑Short ( 2 - 8 hours) ☐Average ( 8 - 12 hours) ☐Long ( 12+ hours) ☐Endless\\n\\n===[Bugs]=== ☐Game Breaking ☐Many Bugs ☐Few Bugs ☑Nothing\\n\\n===[Others]=== ☑Single-player ☑Achievements ☑Trading Cards\\n\\n===[Additional Comments]===\\n\\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a retro metroidvania with modern elements (very souls-like), and the fourth installment in the Momodora franchise. In this game you play as Kaho, a young priestess, that is looking for the source of a curse so that she can destroy it. While traversing the areas you will have a leaf (the primary attack, your melee weapon), a bow, and various items/spells (that you purchase from a merchant or find as treasure) at your disposal. This game offers four difficulty levels, making it approachable for nearly everyone; However, there are some relatively minor sexual themes so you might find inappropriate for children.\\n\\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\\nThis game is absolutely stunning looking. The areas, bosses, and enemies are all very diverse and beautifully done. There are quite a few different areas presented in this game (from the woods to the chapels and castles), and the amount of different enemy types is impressive for such a small game. [spoiler]Lubella and Derelict Frida are two particularly beautiful bosses[/spoiler]. The animations are super smooth and wonderful to watch as well. The whole experience just looked exceptionally polished.\\n \\nOn top of looking the great, the game [i]feels [/i] great. The melee combat has such a wonderful weight to it that is just so satisfying to me. Finding ways to work the bow in to combos was really fun, and experimenting with the different items/spells was also really rewarding. The items added a wonderful modern element to an otherwise relatively simple game. The bosses were all pretty exciting to fight; I particularly enjoyed fighting [spoiler]Pardoner Fennel, Lubella, and the Queen[/spoiler]. Combat aside, the movement in the game felt just right; tight, and not too slow or fast. Once you unlock [spoiler]the ability to turn in to a cat[/spoiler], you can traverse areas a little bit faster. The checkpoints were really forgiving, and teleporting around also made the size of the map totally do-able without being overwhelming. I also really enjoyed the concept of defeating bosses without getting hit to get extra rewards. The four difficulty options make sure that just about anyone could play the game and enjoy it, and personally, I found Insane (the hardest difficulty, where you die in one hit) to be the perfect challenge for me.\\n\\nThe story in the game isn\\'t very exciting, but I also don\\'t think it\\'s really that significant to the experience. This game borrows a little from Dark Souls (the checkpoint system reminds me of it, unlocking the ability to teleport about halfway through the game, and various other elements like some of the items you can use), but it definitely doesn\\'t have nearly as serious of a story. You are basically just playing as a priestess that is on a quest to [spoiler]defeat an evil Queen to prevent her from destroying the world. In doing so you end up sacrificing yourself for the greater good[/spoiler]. It\\'s very cliche, but that is standard for action/adventure games. I suppose I should mention that [spoiler]there are two possible endings (a good ending and a bad ending). As far as I know, the only thing that really matters is whether or not you upgrade your leaf before you defeat the final boss. If you upgrade the leaf you will unlock a third boss phase and the good ending[/spoiler]. The writing in this game definitely doesn\\'t escape the shadow of the visuals, gameplay, or music.\\n\\nThe music is just great. I particularly like the tracks House of Cinders (the opening is extremely atmospheric and kind of reminds me of a broody Dead Can Dance song), Pardoner\\'s Dance (it\\'s just beautiful), and The Lovely Queen (it\\'s so intense and retro). I actually listened to the OST after finishing the game just to take in the music a little bit more and it\\'s a pretty great soundtrack that adds a lot to the experience of the game (the Pardoner boss fight is so much better with that track playing). The sound design is also really great, with the combat and movement sounding wonderful and making everything just come together so well. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this game (to everyone, but particularly people who enjoy retro games or metroidvanias), especially at such a low price ($9.99 is truly a bargain for this game). My first playthrough was around three hours, with subsequent playthroughs being under an hour. In all four of my playthroughs (one on each difficulty) I didn\\'t experience any bugs or issues. I did receive this game in a bundle. Dark Souls Lite. Far darker than you think Fast, fun Metroidvania. Doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. Solid soundtrack too. \\n\\nChallenge is pretty much just right for me. There are frustrating moments, but it\\'s easy to stop, strategize, and try something new, and the difficulty rarely feels cheap-you can identify your fuckups and know how to do better next time. For better or worse, I 100%\\'ed it within 20 hours, but it looks like the game has a bit of a cult following, and you could definitely cook up your own challenges involving items and playstyles. The English translation has some weirdness, but the story\\'s still clear enough. \\n\\nOne wacky caveat that I managed to miss is that this is the fourth game in a series. Chronologically, it\\'s the  first, so you don\\'t need to play the others, but I was almost done with this one when I found out, and normally I like to play a series in release order. So consider yourself warned if you actually care about that kinda thing This is a very solid game, fit for speed runs. There are several levels of difficulty, whether you want a casual run or a hardcore one hit death run, there is enough to enjoy. Good Game good gameplay loop, but as plot it\\'s just ok i guess? \\nbuy it on sale time. Fun, cute, short metroidvania. Took me almost exactly 6 hours to beat with 99% map completion.\\nIt\\'s on the simpler side for this genre, which is good because I mostly wanted to sit back and enjoy the pixel art style they used and not stress out too much. One of the best search action (metroidvania) games out there. It\\'s short at 4-5 hours, but that\\'s the perfect length in my opinion. More of an action platformer rather than a full on metroidvania. The level design is pretty straight forward and backtracking is pretty minimal for a standard metroidvania with secrets being fairly simple. Character upgrades are sparse. I finished the game with the true ending in about 6 hours with 99% map exploration. that being said the platforming was good and the combat felt great. 10 dollars i feel is a bit steep but i got it on sale for 5 which i feel was worth it. i finished wanting more, i just wish the game was a bit deeper. i pray a sequel is released with much more depth cus i did totally love the art and world.\\n\\nfun game too short wait for sale... The only strong positives I can give for this game is that it\\'s entirely functional with consistent art and themes. Everything seemed to work properly. Otherwise, a completely forgettable metroidvania experience: there\\'s nothing here that stands out from anything else in the genre. There\\'s little enemy variety which makes trudging through areas a slog of repetition. You have two attacks which never change throughout the course of the game, making the backtracking un-fun compared to other games in the genre that juxtapose your present abilities against what use to be challenging to deal with. Design choices that slow down gameplay such as not having a minimap, an item bar that only has 3 quick slots but can be changed out at any time by pausing. There isn\\'t a strong narrative, character development, mysteries to investigate, or other internal motivation to drive your actions other than \\'I want to beat the game.\\' Additionally, it\\'s incredibly short, and the difference between the \\'good\\' and \\'bad\\' ending is picking up one item at the end that requires a slight bit of backtracking.\\n\\nLastly, there is a section that requires you to go underwater to progress. Until this point, jumping in water was an instant death. I explored the entire map searching for a hidden ability or passage to continue, only to find that there was one place that you could enter the water without dying. As far as I could tell, there was no in-game information to express this was the correct path. This was disappointing for someone that enjoys exploration games. Not only that, but, once in the water, you have infinite air and can \\'swim\\' by jumping as much as you want. Knowing that, why even make water hazards before this that instantly kill you if the water is harmless otherwise? It\\'s a strange design choice to be sure.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to get into a game in the genre, this might be an ok starting point, otherwise you won\\'t find much substance in this game to keep you invested. You\\'re be better served to play Symphony of the Night as far as AAA games go, and perhaps Death\\'s Gambit if you want to stay indie. Great little game that shouldn\\'t take too long too complete, great soundtrack and atmosphere, and pretty challenging \\n\\n9.2/10 Great game, a very fun challenge. I wish the worldbuilding was fleshed out more, but that might be done in the other games in the series, so I can\\'t say its definitely a negative. An enjoyable challenge, it took me about 10 hours to get the true ending and I went for most of the secrets. I was pretty upset to have to down-vote this review, but there were several aspects that I just could not overlook for the overall experience. To start out, as per usual with this developers games and the Momodora series, touching an enemy deals damage and I will never agree with that, it only gets worse with the difficulty going up in the game. The insta-kill spikes are also a huge turn-off, as they are in the other games. What I found amusing was a underwater level, but every other aspect of water in the game is instant death. The boss fights can be grueling due to the fact they take so long, you just don\\'t deal a decent amount of damage unless you have certain items which a majority you get from completing perfect boss kills which are /also/ difficult. I thought I was mind-boggled at the hard mode, well when i got to insane mode, I was just about ready to close the game and walk away, which sometimes I had to do to take a break before coming back. The only positive note I can say about this game that I adored was the fact you get cursed into being a cat and can switch forms. Short and sweet there\\'s some cute as heck designs in this game from the imp girls to the big blue witch with chompers, but man the amount of detail put into the game\\'s \"feel\" is crazy and i don\\'t think screenshots can do the game justice. i was definitely feeling bummed out towards the end. melancholy is a good way to describe this game. you can beat the game in 4 hours on your first playthrough, a bit on the short side, but it never overstays its welcome\\n\\nalso you turn into a cat for your \"morphball upgrade\" so that\\'s a 8/10 for me. good w Personally not the biggest fan of Metroidvanias but the stellar pixel art really sold me on this one. I\\'m glad it did because paired with the music, it generates a beautiful setting; this game has a nobledark aesthetic and nails it. On top of some (Lord forgive me), \\'Souls-like\\' mechanics, exploring and boss fights were quite fun. One in particular, [spoiler] Pardoner Fennel\\'s fight [/spoiler], I really loved. The story ain\\'t half bad either and I was thoroughly invested by the end. 100% exploration/completion doesn\\'t feel tedious and you are rewarded as you uncover the narrative piece by piece. After playing I can still personally say that the art is the main selling point of this game, but its other facets live up to that standard. 9/10. The game is a masterpiece of pixel art, and it got everything right.\\nIt\\'s very smooth, the enemies are diverse, the environment is also very varied and never disappoints.\\nThe bosses are on point, and one thing that is extremely important for some: [b] it is difficult! [/b].\\nI\\'m playing the game on normal difficulty and it\\'s already quite challenging. The music is really good too, the story is a bit vague but I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily a bad thing.\\nThere are multiple shop items that provide interesting twists to the mechanics as well and I honestly didn\\'t expect as much for a game like this, I\\'m super impressed.\\nThis is one of the only solo games that had me actually hooked for the past 10 years, I really recommend it, you won\\'t regret it at all. This game is a pretty darn good metroidvania with a dark retro atmosphere. This is the fourth game in the series but is a prequel so you can feel safe in starting here. The others, the third is available on steam for almost nothing, while the first two are freeware.\\n\\nThere is a decent amount of challenge to it and there is a lot to discover. It is rather short though, with a single run lasting possibly under 10 hours to 100%. But there are a few additional challenges and modes to unlock. The gameplay is rather souls-like, with dodging being very important to survival, since even normal mode will kill you in 2-3 hits if you aren\\'t careful, but you do get an assortment of items to keep you healthy.\\n\\nFor those wanting to get everything, a few pointers:\\n\\nYou get bonus items for beating bosses without damage.\\nThe Insane difficulty (one hit deaths) is unlocked when you beat hard mode. It\\'s awful, literally one of the worst games i have ever played. yes Great Game. A great follow-up or lead-up to Hollow Knight for those interested. Super solid metroidvania game! Pixel art is crisp and movement feels amazing. I like that all consumable items refill when you rest at a checkpoint! Makes it so you actually want to use you damn items! ^^ The game doesn\\'t do anything crazy and while being a metroidvania you mostly get to new places with help of keys. It\\'s not a bad thing! In a shorter game like this it can be nice to get to know how your character just works without getting new upgrades thrown at you :P Only critique i have would be that it feels like you exploit the invincibility frames of your roll to get through the entire game :o Making lot of combat a little 1 dimensional. Still a super solid game over all and would recommend to most people since i think most gamers would enjoy a well rounded metroidvania like this! :) Story: You defeat E-thottery by the power of cannabis\\nGameplay: I hate cats, even big milkies couldn\\'t save this one\\nMusic: plin plin plong\\n\\nAll of this doesn\\'t really matter cuz i\\'m a sucker for witches\\n8/10 Very, very fun. It\\'s got a cast of fun characters, the bossfights and combat in general are pretty rewarding, and the art is just beautiful. It\\'s pretty cheap too, and goes on sale pretty regularly. It\\'d be a crime not to pick it up, because odds are you\\'ll really enjoy it. A fun game with really stunning and cute pixel graphics, an amazing soundtrack, and enjoyable combat. It\\'s a little short, but it left me wanting to see more out it\\'s environments and characters. Excellent.  A short and sweet Metroidvania.  Punishing, though - the individual challenges aren\\'t  overwhelming  but the punishment for failure is significant.  I found this set a pleasant atmosphere of dread without overdoing the feeling of frustration, but ymmv. If you don\\'t mind the 4:3 aspect ratio and the relatively small play time, it\\'s a pretty interesting game. While this short and simple metroidvania has some tight gameplay and nice pixel graphics, it somehow ends up feeling less than the sum of its parts; that is, while it is clearly the work of an indie developer who has their hearth in the right place, it still lacks that refinement that games done by more experienced have.\\n\\nDespite that, I can still recommend it (specially if on sale) for a short bout of action platformer. I\\'m a metroidvania veteran and completed the game in about 5 hours with the true ending by colecting all the secrets. Be warned tough that this game is deceptivelly challenging and will certainly provide some pain for the more casual players, who might perhaps be more well served with some of the bigger and more polished/approachable other metroidvania games out there. Fun metroidvania-style game. Definitely check it out. downside its super short playthrough (5 hrs). great combat, exploration, art and gameplay all round Beautiful 8/10\\n\\nA fun and well done metroidvania game.\\n\\nFollowing from previous Momodora games, RUTM maintains the pixelated art style but with some changes - mainly on how characters look, with bigger sprites and more detail. The game is also different in the sense that it\\'s more of a metroidvania game, with less linearity involved. It\\'s also considerably longer than previous games, though still quite short for a metroidvania game, being able to be finished in a few hours.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is quite good and the game looks and plays great. The game\\'s only downfall is the difficulty, which feels unbalanced - I ended up restarting the game on Easy after trying out the game on Normal, since after the first area, there is a huge difficulty spike that makes the game feel a lot more frustrating than it should actually be, and some bosses can kill the character in very few hits.\\n\\nCharacter progression could also have been a lot better for a game of this genre - there are health upgrades that can be obtained, but the health increase is very small. Certain bonuses can also be found during the game, but they\\'re required to progress through the game anyway. Also, only 2 passive items can be equipped at any time, which severely limits options for upgrading the character.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a great game and it\\'s also very cheap, but it could have been a lot better if these issues were addressed. i can say proudly this is my favourite game of all time.\\nGreat map and level design with detailed and interesting world that makes just exploring the areas a lot of fun. The game has variety of amazing and memorable characters. It doesn\\'t have to have deep messages or anything like that its just a fun game to play. Made with care something you can\\'t find easily A really charming game that could have been a little longer.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight has quite nice art style, using the simplicity of the characters to build some surprisingly fluid sprite animation. The soundtrack also is pretty good, and fits nicely with the theme of each region (and the game, overall).\\n\\nGameplay wise, I feel the combat against regular enemies is solid, and most of the regions are fun to explore. The ability to use both melee and ranged attacks since the beginning is quite neat, since it offers more options in the way you engage in battles. The bosses are also fun, despite having a pretty small arsenal of attacks.\\n\\nMy only major problem is that the story was quite basic and short. There are some NPCs, but there is not enough to them to make an impression.\\n\\nOverall, a nice game that really could have benefited from a little more content. Pretty much everything you would want from a retro style metroidvania.\\n\\nThe bosses are fun and memorable while not being too difficult. The soundtrack is atmospheric and interesting.  Combat was pretty simplistic but never felt too repetitive or arduous. Environments are a bit dull but other than that exploration was pretty fun. Overall it was incredibly charming and enjoyable throughout. So I could recommend it to anyone who typically enjoys this kind of game. The Momodora games keep getting better and better. Solid controls, pleasant art style, absolutely depressing atmosphere and story. Great controls, fluid animation, fun challenging gameplay.\\n\\nI love the use of consumables in this game, you can swap them out in the middle of battles and they refill when entering checkpoints. Perfect use of modern gaming ideas mixed with a classic-style metroidvania makes for a really fun experience. Nice metroidvania type game. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, es un gran juego al estilo Metroidvania. Con un mapa sumamente amplio por explorar, Un arte genuinamente hermoso y al estilo anime. una historia entretenida, y una dificultad retadora tanto en acertijos como en batallas. Sin duda alguna un gran juego Well, I gave it a shot and I am so regret about it ! \" A \" and \" S \" for menu buttons ? Why ? Couldn\\'t you just make it more normal compare to other games ? Game could be a great game, I don\\'t know a lot about it because thanks to shit controls, I couldn\\'t even pass the first level. \" A \" for jump and \" S \", \" D \" for attack haha, if you don\\'t have time to learn and get use into there stupid controls, don\\'t buy it. It\\'s just waste of time and as addition, I couldn\\'t find fullscreen mode. Great pixel graphics, music, and gameplay. Metroid but seen through the degenerate eyes of a 15 year old boy with an Anime addiction, AKA most of you reading this good 2D Dark Souls. I like it A beautiful, atmospheric and well-made action platformer. It\\'s tough, but fair. Feels good to play and replay. Lots of secrets and different strategies. mario pissing no This game is beatiful.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m not just talking about the graphics, even though they are in fact a gorgeous somewhat pixelated style. I\\'m talking about the gameplay, the music, the atmosphere, the plot, everything.\\nIt\\'s a fantastic mix of ranged and melee 2D action platforming, and another must have from the momodora series.\\n\\nIt\\'s great to see an developer from my home country make such an amazing game. It\\'s the first game of the Momodora franchise that i play, but as a standalone title: Momodora RUTM it\\'s an excellent metroidvania game.\\nChallenging, solid level design, good soundtrack and nice pixel art. You can finish it in 9~10h, but it\\'s very worth it while it last! Controls are stiff and playing on controller is absolutely rough on the trigger buttons. In my opinion, the game makes me feel like I\\'m fighting with the controls rather than the actual game. Majority of the time i am fighting a hard boss I can see the bosses tell of a certain move but inputs feel delayed maybe due to the stiff control feeling for me. I can\\'t recommend the to anyone who hates stiffer controls but if you can adapt to the game\\'s control and enjoy a difficult game, you\\'ll probably like this game. Good action-platformer with tight controls, nice pixel graphics, and solid music. Doesn\\'t overstay its welcome and sticks to the basics of items and powerups.  Worth playing through at least once. Nice game, not too long either. It\\'s a bit on the hard side (enemies hit hard and there\\'s some instant kill things like spikes, and some bosses really require you to learn their attack patterns well). Story is a bit light though and there could\\'ve been a bit more direction on where to go. Oh, and IMO the dev kinda missed the mark on the save point/warp mechanics. It unlocks way too late, and you cannot choose specific warp points, only one fixed per zone. Ok so dark souls, but many females and no z axis. 2d souls like metroidvania. There\\'s the buzzwords.\\n\\nThis game is very souls like, in tone and in similar mechanics. I know you\\'re probably sick of \"souls like\" but you don\\'t bitch at \"rogue like\" now do you? It\\'s just an effective way to explain in the least amount of words, but I digress.\\n\\nPretty satisfying mechanics and gameplay, dark and brooding tone with interesting boss fights and enemies, varied and good looking environments, mysterious characters... It\\'s all good stuff, pacing is done rather well, exploration feels tense and rewarding, there\\'s a couple of endings, but not much choice or anything like that.\\n\\nThe boss fights are cool, but there\\'s this dumb hidden mechanic where you get a special item if you kill the boss without taking any damage. You could think this is a neat little thing for people who have already gotten pretty good at the game and want a challenge, but these items are usually pretty damn good items, and people who are that good at the game DON\\'T NEED EXTRA HELPING ITEMS. How hard is this to understand?? Why would you put a challenge in the game that gives players more power when the players who need that more will be the players who can\\'t get them? Not to mention the monotony of trying to kill a boss without being hit once, and once you\\'re hit just having to suicide and try again. It\\'s just a really dumb design choice that this game is not unique in making.\\n\\nOther than that, this game is quite good. Really good. Amazing game. Not that long but there is a lot of hidden content. It\\'s a prequel to Momodora 1-3 so you don\\'t need to play those games before playing this. Great game but not a great Metroidvania.\\nThis game is short and sweet. I beat it on hard in a bit more than 4 hours. The beginning was hard, but as soon as I got used to it was a breeze, especially the bosses, that are telegraphed.\\nThe pixel art is well done and the music is decent.\\n\\nThe single problem I have with this game is that it was sold to me as a Metroidvania, and I think that part is lacking. Don\\'t get me wrong, the game is really good, but I\\'m pointing out a design choice that is not the best, according to ME (personal opinion).\\nYou start off the bat with a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, double jump and a dash that can be used both on the floor and in the air. There is a single ability-gating upgrade, which is [spoiler]the cat transform, that lets you reduce your size[/spoiler]. Every other item you get is either optional or literally keys that open doors.\\nThe game does have an interconnected world and some backtracking, couple that with the single upgrade you and I guess we can call it a Metroidvania, but I am sure it would be even greater if the dash, double jump, and ranged weapon were acquired during the gameplay. Very fun Metroidvania game, and one of my favorite games in general. Not much else to say, the game is really solid. I recommend starting on Hard mode. Make sure you don\\'t take damage from any of the bosses. \"Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight\" is a fun but fairly short Metroidvania game that immediately reminded me of the web-series RWBY. \\n\\nI enjoyed the anime style graphics and picked it up on sale. Initially I treated \"Momodora\" as more of a hack and slash game but I quickly realized I was mistaken. \\n\\nEven on normal mode basic enemies kill you in only a few hits. The ability to roll through attacks was vital to kill even the most basic enemies. I came to appreciate the fighting since timing and attack recognition were necessary against the bosses rather than just raw firepower. \\n\\nMy main criticism of \"Momodora\" is that it\\'s a very short game. I\\'m terrible at video games and freely explored but with a walk-through (or even a better sense of direction) this game can be beaten in two hours and that isn\\'t including if you want to speed run it.  \\n\\nBecause the game is so quick to beat there isn\\'t much in getting upgrades. There are really only three upgrades and again since the game is so brief they\\'re pretty underutilized. \\n\\nIt\\'s a fun game and I don\\'t regret my time playing it but at the same time I did want more. Fun metroidvania game, using a turbo button with poisoned arrows can trivalize some of the game however. grteat gameplay and controls pretty good\\n I\\'ve heard great things about this game, so I gave it a shot, but after experiencing it, I mostly feel frustrated by its design. There are enemies throwing things at you from out of the screen. Touching enemies hurt you sometimes, but sometimes not (I\\'m sure there is a logic behind it, but it\\'s not clear to me). You can jump mid-air, but it\\'s so tiny of a boost that I don\\'t even feel like using it. Yet, it is frequently needed to reach some platforms, and since it is so tiny, it gets really difficult to make some jumps that should actually be trivial. I also had some issues with the controls. E.g., after using an item, I expected to be able to switch items right after, but it\\'s not possible. I know I have to wait a bit to use another item, but I should at least be able to switch it whenever I want! I died a bunch of times to a boss, because this very thing kept failing me. The game is difficult, which could be a good thing, but I don\\'t think it is difficult in a good way. It feels mostly like artificial difficulty to me. After many tries, when I finally conquer a difficult section, I don\\'t feel like I earned it, or that I\\'m better at the game after that many tries. Instead, I feel like I just memorized where the enemies are, when they are going to attack, and I react accordingly. Even though I\\'m disappointed at this game, I\\'ll give it another shot later. This game got me into castlevanias. I loved it all the way through. This game was a real surprise. I had never heard of any of these when I stumbled across the trailer.  The controls are tight and  the world is colorful. The setting is pretty fun though I never cared too much about the story. If I have a gripe about the gameplay, it is that the dodge is really difficult to time.  The game as a whole is just really tough. I don\\'t think I made it through any areas on the first try. Some enemies are also really spongy which makes the excessive retries annoying. That turned out to be more complaints than I meant I guess. There is a lot more depth than I would have expected from the trailer and Gameboy Advanced graphics. I really had a good time with this short, tough as nails explorer. Momodora 4 lengthens the play time, improves the graphics, and cleans up the combat and over powered equipment from Momodora 3 and overall is a miraculous improvement (in most areas; more on that later). Momodora 4 is much more of a metroidvania than its predecessor but still fumbles the progression elements. Most of the main power-ups are not linked to progression and can be acquired in any order; therefore, for the power-ups that are linked to progression, the worlds optional areas are accessible in an uneven manner and discourage exploration. The inclusion of hitting random walls to destroy them without indication still remains a mechanic I believe is outdated but I do personally think neutral of the mechanic. For the positives, the world is fun to initially progress through and poses a mild challenge. The combat adds a three hit chain attack with the attack button and the same bow as the last game. All in all, a game worth playing but it did not knock my socks off.  There are clear areas for improvement and I cannot wait to try the next game by the development team: Minoria.\\nThe bosses left a lot to be desired. I would almost say the bosses are a downgrade from Momodora 3 but one boss actually left an impression on me that I will remember as one of my favourite bosses I have ever fought. The one boss I did enjoy ended up raising my excitement too high because the rest of them were disappointing. Some of the bosses were above average but the bosses worse than ‘above average’ were awful. So, I guess overall, a polarizing boss experience. I cannot responsibly recommend Momodora 4 for boss fighters but there is something to enjoy if you chose to anyways.  \\n This game is a hidden treasure.  It\\'s something you can sit down with time and again and still appreciate. Heavy: It\\'s nice Really worthwile and fun. At first it looks like a clone of Castlevania, but the mood is completely different. It\\'s more mystical and fairytale like. The gameplay is superb and the main reason I\\'ve spent 20+ hours playing it. Controls are really tight, and items in the game are really fun to discover. The music suits its tone perfectly and the enemies are really varied and intriguing. Tons of characters to interact with. A real treat and a surprise with tons of replay value. Momodora has gone down a path of trimming away weapons, improving its art assets, and making more believable, though not as satisfying, levels.\\nReverie under the Moonlight is a fantastic full-length game that shows the boons of having gone down that path.\\n\\nSprite designs are much improved in fidelity/quality with matching animations.\\nGame map feels like a real world, and it is beautiful to say the least.\\nStory is simple, but much more \\'there\\' than in any previous title.\\n\\nGameplay elements are much more compacted from past games with all the gadgets and whatnot removed, but the two weapons with modifiable properties feel great and their expanded complexities and use-cases easily make up for the losses.\\nLethal-contact damage from previous titles is removed in favour of more complex space games with the bosses.\\nMelee will move you forward a bit on each attack, and the third more powerful attack in each combo will lock you in its animation, but the THWACK delivered by said attack is oh so satisfying on the bosses.\\n\\nNormal enemies are a great tutorial starting off, but will just be a tedious mini-puzzle in each stage as the player learns the game.\\n\\nGoing to miss some of what has been lost since Momodora II, but overall this is a great title that comes highly recommended.\\n\\nnote: Unlike in previous titles this entry\\'s final boss is disappointingly easy, do try and defeat the optional secret boss for a challenge. It\\'s a really good game, extremely clunky at times though.\\nIf it\\'s your first time playing, you need nerves of steel to start on hardmode like I did lol, but once you get used to it, it\\'s a bit better.\\n\\nGraphics are really good, for the pixelated genre.\\n\\nMusic is soothing and pretty good. This is a fun little game. It has a certain charm, and the mechanics are straightforward. Overall, the experience is better than the gameplay itself, which can be a bit slow and floaty. First, the world is well thought out and charming. I could easily explore and enjoy what the world has to offer, and the unique flavor lets you know you\\'re playing something that is in many ways set apart from the average 2D scroller. This brings me to the art, which is very well done in a similar manner. I find the different areas visually impressive, and while they bear a kind of simplicity they also feel alive insofar as the medium can allow such a thing. The sound design helps with this as well, and while the sounds of the world (voices, footsteps, attacks, etc.) are fairly average, the music girds this title with a sense of adventure. The gameplay is pretty classic in its concept, making it easy to understand and very straightforward, providing no barrier to getting right into the game. Also, points for control scheme customization. The execution of this gameplay, however, is where I feel the games comes up a bit short. I found myself heavily favoring ranged attacks simply because the close-up melee attack took so long to animate. The movement in general felt floaty, and made any attempt at precision a gamble. It was somewhat annoying interacting with an otherwise interesting world. I found myself having to slow myself down to the game\\'s pace in order to play comfortably. Overall, if you\\'re looking for a nice creative game to play for a while and don\\'t mind that the inputs aren\\'t as crisp as they are in some other games, I think you\\'re in for a fun time. From what I have played of it, I give Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight a solid 6.5/10. Great atmosphere, engaging combat, gorgeous locations... What\\'s there NOT to like? ((Also, the duel with Pardoner on insta-kill mode was one of the greatest gaming experiences I ever had)) This game is very beautiful and has very good and very nice controls. The soundtrack and the visuals create an amazing atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone who liked or enjoyed hollow knight. Game has two endings the \"bad\" and the \"true/good\" one. Both were very interesting and enjoyable.\\nOverall, loved it! This is a very nice metroidvania game! It took a while for me to get into it, because I was stupid and chose the hard mode which is SPECIFICALLY NOT for first playthroughs. I thought I could do it because I\\'ve played things like Hollow Knight in the past, but take it from me and play it how it should be played the first time. \\n\\nThat being said, it takes a while to start unlocking areas and find useful items or permanently upgrade your moveset, but this is not as much of a problem for a shorter game.\\n\\nThe combat is fine, and mostly comes down to dodging and hitstun, so I wish there was a little more depth there. While there are various enemies, you pretty much deal with them in the same fashion: hitstun up close or spam/charge arrows at range.\\n\\nThe bosses have fair patterns and usually take a few tries. They are pretty fun!\\n\\nFor me the game is very enjoyable, I just have some nitpicks with it. It feels a bit unpolished in some areas. For some dialogue, there are unnecessary pauses. For bosses with multiple phases, they just kind of reappear awkwardly. The penultimate boss doesn\\'t even have a title, what\\'s that about? Some of the atmosphere is great like in Karst Castle, while other places have deadpan ambience. That\\'s fine because the tone is pretty lonely, but it just feels out of place when other areas have fuller soundtracks.\\n\\nWith all that said, do I still like the game? Yes! I\\'m excited for the next one whenever it comes out. I think with a little polish and quality of life improvements it can be even better :) this game is quite good, not too long but it\\'s good, the story is simple and doesn\\'t takes too much lines to explain what\\'s happening, simple but good combat that you upgrade at the same time you progress through the story, nice pixel art and sound, a simple metroidvania that everyone can enjoy Great metroidvania for newcomers to the genre if you want a quick experience with combat and exploration. An alternative for people who feel intimidated by the scope and difficulty of other classics in the genre i.e. Hollow Knight, Metroid 2, Ori...\\n\\nAlso boob Witch. Love While a rather short game, it\\'s absolutely wonderful: the music, the artwork, and the game play are all tight. Anyone looking for a quick Metroidvania fix will enjoy this game. Just all round good platformer in regards to aesthetics, mechanics, variety, and optional challenges.\\nExploration % would indicate that I\\'m about half way through my playthrough, and so far I\\'m enjoying myself. =)\\nIt does have the whole hit every wall in case it has secret passages thing going, which I\\'m not a giant fan of, but other than that I really don\\'t find anything to complain about. Metroidvania, anime, darksouls. These were the ingredients chosen by the developer for the perfect indie game, and i gotta say the final product is impressive. :megusta: Anime girls and cats...\\nWhat could go wrong? A very good metroidvania given the low price, with cute pixel art and a sombre soundtrack. It is quite short, but the achievements for different types of playthroughs and speedrun potential lend this game a good amount of replay value. 8/10 tachilo Solid indie metroidvania, worth at least one play-through for any fan of the genre. fun metroidvania with old school design philosophy. Has clear inspiration in Symphony of the Night. Beautiful artwork and an atmospheric soundtrack help to lend the setting a very melancholy feel. Gameplay is challenging but fair. Good athmosphere, cute but brutal. No too difficult on easy mode Short but very nice. Ignored Assassin\\'s Creed for this. :] This is a solid Metroidvania experience with a fair learning curve, simple yet effective mechanics and a lovely aesthetic. The combat is basic yet flashy and fun to get the hang of. The level design is well thought out with plenty of secrets and hidden paths to reward players for their exploration. Most of the bosses, with one unfortunately unfair exception, are a fair challenge with some interesting attack patterns, and I really felt like I had got better at the game by the time I defeated the final boss. This isn\\'t the greatest game I\\'ve ever played but its a consistent and enjoyable experience that those new to the Metroidvania genre will likely enjoy. Its only around five to seven hours long but for the price its understandable, and with a new game + mode I\\'m yet to experience and a few corners of the map still undiscovered I feel like this game still has plenty to offer me.\\n\\nMy only complaints: \\n\\nPardoner Fannel\\'s boss fight borders on unfair at times, with her being able to change direction in combos and telegraph and make randomised attacks within my window of healing. I totally understand why her character has the movesets that she does yet I felt like this really pushed boundaries. A solid boss fight but I do have my issues.\\n\\nOther issues include a mismatch of tone on occasion, with the humour feeling out of place with how gloomy and dark the atmosphere of the game is, and sometimes the backtracking can get a little stale. There are also some issues with translation and grammar at times but these are very minor. Besides my issues with the boss fight these issues are minor however.\\n\\nOverall, a game I don\\'t consider perfect yet overall one I can recommend to fans of Metroidvanias and platformers in general. A beautiful game with an immersive and amazing OST! Great replay value in my opinion and very fun and difficult boss fights! This game looks good, sounds good and feels good. It\\'s just a solid time overall It\\'s a good metroidvania game.\\nThe enemies are sometime a bit generic, but the boss fights are varied.\\nThe pattern of attacks are neither too hard nor too easy. It takes a bit to learn when you should attack and which attack you should use (melee/ranged).\\nThe designs are very unique.\\nIt\\'s worth the price. fun little game. beautiful pixel visuals. nice music and sound effects. intricate world structure that rewards a bit of exploration. simple yet satisfying combat mechanics. Bit short, bit easy but fun and well worth buying on sale What a nice game. Short and sweet, but very good combat, exploration, music, and art. Take Symphony of the Night and make it pixelated and a little lighter and you get this game. If you want a quick dose of SotN gameplay, give this a try. good game got the true ending on the first run :D Very fun and cute game. Gameplay is very satisfying. Lovingly-made Brazilian Metroidvania with heavy Souls elements. Top-tier soundtrack, and very atmospheric environments. Would easily recommend at full price to support the creators. A speedrunner\\'s dream. In my opinion the best 2D interpretation of a Souls game to this day.\\n\\n[h1][i] +++ Positives +++ [/i] [/h1]\\n\\n+ Perfectly tuned difficulty - Played on hard, it is a very difficult game but never unfair. Every time I died I could tell what I messed up on and fix it. I play a lot of Souls games though, for a beginner I would even recommend going a difficulty down.\\n\\n+ AMAZING soundtrack, one of the few game soundtracks I find myself listening to when I\\'m not playing the game, especially the title and garden themes.\\n\\n+ Great boss design, they will one and two shot you on hard, but once you memorise their patterns in each phase and learn to dodge and use items to your advantage, you will get past them. No unfair RNG bosses.\\n\\n+ Items make your character faster, the game is non-linear and seems to encourage speedrunning a lot. Good for replayability.\\n\\n+ Decent amount of collectibles and secret walls to be found.\\n\\n[h1][i] Nit-Picks [/i] [/h1]\\n\\n+ The map needs a little more clarity. It did it\\'s job well enough, but I still found myself running into brick walls when I thought I wouldn\\'t by looking at the map. Needs to be labelled and the closed off entrances should be color-coded in my opinion.\\n\\n+ The second time (for me) you encounter one of the bosses, their attacks are a similar color to the background, which can make it hard to distinguish them. This is the only design problem I have with a boss in the entire game. Одна из лучших метроидваний, что я играл. При этом в отличии от почти всех остальных игр подобного жанра, в эту играть просто, а сама игра короткая, что идет ей на пользу. Рекомендую! Good, though a bit short. Plenty of stuff to come back to after finishing the game. I\\'m a huge fan of metroidvanias. This game is excellent. It has a sprawling map, is fairly open ended, branching out into multiple different zones pretty quickly with no indication of where you should go next. Plenty of secrets sprinkled throughout the land, fun and engaging combat, fairly mysterious lore driven by in game dialogue. Reminds me of some old school games like Faxanadu or the original Metroid in terms of atmosphere. My only real complaint is that there aren\\'t more achievements, and that some areas feature instant death pits which are holes that kill you if you fall down them, which is absolutely dumb in a metroidvania. Seriously though, this game is a perfect example of a \\'vania done right. I am trying to find small indie games that are often overlooked but are actually fun to play. Unfortunatly I can\\'t say this is one of those games.\\n\\nIn my opinion game lack clear way guidance. Often I fould myself asking \"Where should I go now?\" even if this game is linear. There is backtracking and game thinks I will remember every part of the level I have missed. Map didn\\'t help either because it is hard to see where the doors are. So I had to google where is the part I have to backtrack to actually progress in the game. \\n\\nCombat was ok though. Story is meh to non existent. I haven\\'t played earlier installments in the series so I had no idea what was going on.\\n\\nTL;DR If you want to play a game for a few hours that you will forget by the time you kill final boss, you can but this game. If you are looking for a good game, look somewhere else. Fuckin amazing, what a game! The first Metroidvania I\\'ve ever cleared, it was a damn good 5 hours. Really loved the charming world atmosphere, kept me coming back despite the punishing trials and error. I\\'m usually not a fan of games with weak story but this one is special. Rocking that flaming bow in the end like your name\\'s Legolas was priceless.\\n\\nFelt like a bandit getting it on sale, would gladly trade a week of my Starbucks budget to experience something like this all over again haha! 😋 A fun little game, short but sweet~ Bosses are unforgiving, but it\\'s really all a matter of learning the pattern and acting accordingly~ Average indie \"metrodvania\". Nice gameplay with some entertaining moments but nothing spectacular this days. Nice option to spend 2-3 sessions if you can catch it at good price.\\n\\nProbably I\\'ve very high expectations or just I play this after to much \"vania\" masterpices. \\n\\n7/10 Charming, humble, feels cosy. A delicious cupcake to snack during a break. ♥ Was super hard to use keyboard, it sat in my inventory forever! However I just got myself a steam compatible controller and it\\'s super fun! Shame I waited so long to play it :D A solid metroid-vania. Movement is tight and becomes increasingly satisfying as the movement options progress, combat has some moments of frustration on hard mode but overall a super fun game, highly recommended! A fantastic little Metroidvania game. The sprite work is beautiful and the boss fights are fun. Well worth the low asking price, even more when it\\'s on sale. More people need to play this game. So far so good good This game is excellent! The art design is stunning. The gameplay is tight. I had a lot of fun with the platforming and the boss fights. Some parts were challenging, but nothing had me feeling overwhelmed. I played through it pretty much straight through. I strongly recommend it! Really fun game, I don\\'t regret a second Fun game. Fairly short and challenging on hard mode. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a short metroidvania from Brazil.\\n\\nGraphically it\\'s pretty pixel graphics, Kaho has pretty decent animations, in both human and cat form.  Some of the foes are a bit less detailed, but everything generally graphically works.  The reflections when near water look really nice, but sometimes get confusing as to what is the reflection and what is real.  A lot of areas are dark, and sometimes the foes and NPCs can blend into the background.  It\\'s fitting for the story but it makes it easy to take cheap hits.\\n\\nMusic works, it\\'s nothing special but feels appropriate for the game.  Sounds generally fit as well, though a few sound effects come in far too strong (certain foes when melee\\'ed or the spinning staff attack used by the cone hatted foes).\\n\\nBosses are well done, most attacks are well telegraphed.  This is important as defeating certain bosses without losing health (from poison, damage from the boss, or self-damage with items such as the Tainted Missive) will give you a special drop.  Some of these items can be duplicated or mimic\\'ed in lesser form from later purchases, others (such as the extremely strong Bakman Patch from Lubella 1) can be permanently missed for that playthrough and cannot be duplicated by any other items.\\n\\nNon-boss difficulty is pretty high throughout the game.  Kaho is not very durable without getting several vitality upgrades, many of which need cat form or air dashing to reach.  Early game when learning you will die a lot.  The earliest foes you meet are the most random and difficult to deal with, imps and witches.  Later you\\'ll be able to handle foes better.  Spikes and pits are almost always 1-hit kills, and there are a lot of those in mid to late game.  Explore cautiously, and be prepared to redo sections often if you die.  Try to get as many Bellflower upgrades as you can.\\n\\nThe map is passable but not great, most rooms show up on it and there are very few completely secret rooms.  It does not show still closed doors or mark where items you missed are.  Be careful when looking at the minimap with Select on the controller (I\\'m not sure of the keyboard command), as the screen is NOT paused and enemies can still attack.  Looking at the map when accessed from the pause menu will let you check the map safely.\\n\\nThe Ring of Candor which you can purchase will do a chime when you enter a room if there is a secret passage or Ivory Bug in it.  Getting all the Ivory Bugs is extremely difficult as there are several really well hidden ones (in invisible hidden walls or ceilings), and they\\'re only a few pixels in size.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s well worth the purchase if you like metroidvanias, especially if you get it on sale. One of the best metroidvanias around! Great design allows you to explore most of the map from the get go, with very few artificial barriers (\"you need the upgrades x y and z to get past this wall!\"). The length of the game is also just perfect, as there aren\\'t annoyances that exists only to increase the length of the gameplay. While short, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game that kept me coming back to it. The pixel art is beautiful, the music is atmospheric, and the gameplay is tight. However, the story doesn\\'t have enough time to develop in my opinion. You play a Kaho, a priestess from the village of Lun who has journeyed to the Kingdom of Karst to nullify a curse emanating from the kingdom. Along the way, you will fight enemies and meet a few characters. However, because the game is so short, most characters are only good for a few dialogues before they start repeating their script. While this is completely subjective, I would\\'ve liked to learn more about the characters and the world of Momodora without having to read text entries in the items menu. All in all though, it is worth your time to buy this game, and it is absolutely worth your time to buy this game if it is on sale or you like metroidvania games like myself. Oh boy. This game was the game to get me into metroidvanias. Its an absolute blast to play through the first as well as the hundredth time. the gameplay is extremely forgiving for the genre, so its a great game to start with if you want to get into metroidvania styled games, but there are some more difficult achievements for the more experienced players. Great game but not perfect Very fun and straightforward. The story is oversimplified, but that keeps the gameplay streamlined. I loved it. [h1] Indie Absolutist [/h1]\\n\\n[i] TL;DR at the bottom [/i]\\n\\n[u][b] Achievements Earned 9/9 = 100%, Achievement Difficulty = DIFFICULT[/b][/u]\\n\\nRating out of 10 Stars = [h1][strike]* * * * * * * * * *[/strike][/h1]\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is the best mini-metroidvania I have ever played. The games combat, bosses, and artstyle all combine to make a very powerful a tight-feeling game.\\n\\nThe bosses in Momodora 4 are outstanding, each boss feels unique, has a large yet fair amount of moves, and have easily readable tells. Player skill is rewarded uniquely, if you can beat a boss without taking damage, you get a special item. I enjoyed each and every boss and the ones in this game are some of the best in the genre. [b] DO BUY FOR THE BOSSES [/b]\\n\\nThe arstyle and animation are incredible. Seriously, the dev, rdien, outdid himself when he created this art.\\n\\nThe level design and map layout work perfectly together, there is no wasted space. The map is small, and the game time is short, but much like Gato Roboto this game uses every precious second to have you doing something useful, there is absolutley no filler. [b] DO BUY FOR THE CONTENT [/b]\\n\\nThe achievements were few but fun. A few were difficult to obtain, like beating on insane mode (death in 1 hit for almost all the game). Overall, I enjoyed grabbing all the achievements on this one.\\n\\nTo wrap it up, if you have overlooked this tight, beautifully wrapped mini-metroidvania with souls-like elements, then NOW is the time to buy it. I here the dev is already working on a new Momodora project which will be a day 1 buy from me.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[b] TL;DR [/b]\\n\\nMomodora: RuTM has gorgeuous art, outstanding bosses, and tight controls, this is one of my most highly recommended games! I enjoy the games atmosphere and music quite a lot. Boss fights are fun. THIS GAME WAS SO GOOD! I love a good platformer and the art was beautiful. Try it its FUN! this game is short but the pixel art is absolutely beautiful the music is perfect at setting the mood its a very beautiful game the story is pretty basic but its still enjoyable and i know this gets used to describe games alot however it reminds me of like a 2d dark souls especially in karst city all in all its one of my favorite games and i hope they go back to this style for another game 7 Everything about this game is underrated. The piano soundtrack is the best I\\'ve ever heard considering I play piano. A a whole i think this game is slightly better than Celeste and Katana Zero, which if you haven\\'t heard of you should go play. I liked it! Normal difficulty was just right for my rusty... self. Bunch of fun, absolutely recommend and honestly getting more into metroidvania\\'s after completing this, bosses felt a bit underwhelming and easily cheesed but everything else felt smooth and rewarding to complete.\\n\\nWith that said. If I lightly tap 1 more spike and insta-die I\\'m going to GO FERAL. A couple of hours of decent fun. A bit too much backtracking and some bosses have annoying run-ups, but not much of a challenge otherwise. I like how the Momodora games evolved from a simple platformer to a 2D souls like metroidvania.\\n-The bosses were great.\\n-The sound design and music was amazing.\\n-The pixelgraphics are very well done.\\n\\n- 7.8/10 - It\\'s a really fun game that has nice story, platforming, and bosses. The only negative thing I would have to say is how annoying spikes are since they one shot you no matter what you do and then you have to return to your spawn point which is usually a few rooms away. Other than that it\\'s an amazing game! I did not like this game.\\n\\nI did not like dying far from a save point and having to replay stuff.  I did not like how hard it was to dodge enemies, and I did not like I couldn\\'t block anything.  I did not like that I could be killed in 3 hits or so.\\n\\n~I~ did not like this game.  This game was not for ~me~.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re looking so deep into reviews for this game, wondering if just maybe it is for you....then it probably isn\\'t.  You\\'ll know if this is the game for you pretty quickly, I think. \\n\\nSo while my recommendation is \"No\", it does not mean this game is Bad.  It only means I personally would not recommend it based entirely on my subjective opinions. It\\'s good, but there were a lot of sections of the map where i expected something to happen like a fight or puzzle and it just wasn\\'t there. i\\'m used to the big Metroidvanias i guess. You can speed run it on easy in an hour no problem and if you aren\\'t a completionist it would probably take 3-4 hours tops. I finished at 4 hours with about 90% and used the last 2 hours to 100% the game. (did not get all the items). Short game (3-4h) but really cute. Animation is fluid and the game is really pleasant. Game is okay. Has very little variety in enemies, and combat feels somewhat bland. Game elements are inconsistent, with some enemies not dealing contact damage and water being instant death in some areas, when our character can somehow breathe underwater. Overall, the graphics are nice but the actual gameplay has issues. A fun game, and you get pretty much exactly what you expect: if the screenshots and gameplay footage look good to you, you will probably enjoy the game. Beautiful graphics and animations, intuitive and satisfying controls and combat, and a solid metroidvania gameworld. Not much more to say really.\\n\\nAlso, I don\\'t consider it short - I consider most games too long! 3-5 hours is a perfect length if you ask me. (Or, if you play like me, 8 hours. I dunno - I like to take my time with games!) A very tightly designed and polished little metroidvania. Visuals and gameplay are excellent, music is fine but nothing special, and the story is only really there to carry the game forward. Exceptionally short for a Metroidvania (took me around 4 hours to beat), which means not much to do in terms of exploration, and there\\'s only mobility ability that lets you find secrets in old areas.  Beyond that, the combat was serviceable, but nothing to write home about.  If you a diehard of the subgenre you might find this a sufficient diversion, but there are countless alternatives with far more depth. Extremely short, about 3 hours for my near 100% blind playthrough. However, for a few bucks it\\'s a steal and a nice way to spend an afternoon. Higher difficulties for those who want to do such things and actual achievements. Feels kind of like a slower castlevania with a dodge roll and items that recover at bonfi- I mean bells. The similarities to a dark game where you collect souls end there. It manages a good line between punishing decisions and being lenient on execution, but the instant death spikes are pretty unfun. Also, some of the hidden items involve invisible platforms or walking into walls. Even with the item that alerts you to secrets that felt pretty lame. \\n\\nIs it an amazing must-play title? No. Worth it for those into metroidvanias? Yes. [h1][u]Story[/u][/h1]\\nThe game\\'s story revolves around a priestess, named Kaho, who was sent from a different land to deal with an evil threat that creeps across the land. Other than that the story that takes place during the game is there but minimal so you won\\'t see much about it even as you play. They\\'ll get the base points of the story across but that\\'s about it.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\\nThe gameplay is good but can wear on some people as it\\'s the same for every enemy: boss or common enemy. Attack, roll away from attacks, attack, etc. There are some spells but overall the direct confrontation is better as it\\'s quicker to dispatch enemies. The bow is straight up the best thing as you\\'ll stay safe but the gameplay will become dull if you rely on it. Two items you find and buy later on are extremely good for the bow making it common enemy stomper. The item that adds fire damage to your attacks not only does that for the bow but also makes it stagger enemies (drops from the fire boss if you don\\'t take damage during the fight). The secret spider merchant sells an item to allow your arrows to pierce, when combined with the fire item, makes your bow the go to for killing common enemies and even dealing with around half of the bosses.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Difficulty[/u][/h1]\\nAll the difficulties up to hard are relatively easy to deal with if you proficient at side scrolling games like Momodora. The insane difficulty lives up to it\\'s name as you start the game with basically no life and even with all HP upgrades any direct attack from any enemy will kill you. When it comes to dying you can choose to \"retry\" or return to the main menu. If you choose retry it just dumps you back at your last save station and you continue on your way. It\\'s very forgiving when dying even on insane difficulty.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Graphics[/u][/h1]\\nThe graphics are pixel designed. That much is obvious even from the store page. I have a soft spot for these designs as I grew up with pixel games back on the NES and original Gameboy. The graphics of the pixel art itself is pretty nice. Not the best ever but it\\'s great to look at.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Audio[/u][/h1]\\nI didn\\'t have anything to dislike when it came to the sounds or music. It\\'s all nice to hear and works in unison with the game\\'s design. My only gripe is the death scream for your character Kaho is bit loud but that\\'s it.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Performance & Bugs[/u][/h1]\\nGame ran very smooth. Played it with a keyboard and didn\\'t have any issues with any input. The game ran without issue graphically and in general. I don\\'t think I even came across any bugs either or if I did they weren\\'t noticeable.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Summary[/u][/h1]\\nOne of the better side scrolling pixel games I\\'ve played in the past few years and is an experience everyone should try if they like/love these type of games. It might not become one of your favorite games ever but it\\'s something you more than likely will enjoy from beginning to end.\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Notice[/u][/h1]\\nThis review, as with all my reviews, are my own personal thoughts and opinions on the game it is for. Whether I like it or dislike it / recommend it or not recommend it: it does not make it any more valid than someone else\\'s view on the title. I also will not review a game based on a score system as those review designs are flawed. This is from score reviews having a 0 and 10. A game can\\'t reach 0 unless it\\'s unfinished and unreleased and in that case can\\'t be reviewed. No game can be a 10 because that would indicate perfection and no game is perfect. There\\'s always flaws.\\n\\nIf I happen to like or recommend a game it doesn\\'t mean I\\'m blind to any potential flaws it may have nor does it mean I\\'m going to defend the company who made it. If I happen to dislike the game or not recommend it that doesn\\'t mean I hate the devs or the players who like the game. My reviews aim about the game in question and not the players who like or dislike it. If a game is bad enough I will heavily criticize the devs and company. Not every game is going to appeal towards each person of which applies to me as well and in no way is there anything wrong someone liking or not liking a game.\\n\\nIf the game I\\'m reviewing is an online game, be it PvP or PvE, please use [url=https://steamcharts.com/]Steam Charts[/url] to see how populated the game is. You don\\'t want to waste money on a title with no players in it. Just be sure to also take into account games that have crossplay like Microsoft titles. They usually have smaller player bases on PC but if crossplay is available then you generally don\\'t need to worry about a small PC player base.\\n\\nMy reviews might be changed down the line if something gets altered in the game that would warrant an update to said reviews. I may update my reviews as well if I feel they can be done better. If you got all the way to the end of this then thank you for taking the time to read it all. The gameplay wasn\\'t great, bosses were often simple and too repetitive, and I didn\\'t get the story... But the one girl had big boobs so I give it 10/10 An amazing brazillian entry in the metroidvania genre!\\n\\nDespite it being short, it provides quite a challenge. The boss fights are very well done and the artstyle is really something.\\n\\nFor its price, it\\'s an absolute must have! This is a short and sweet metroidvania type game with some elements that remind me a bit of souls like games, mostly in terms of respawning and item management.  It is a pretty short game, it took me about 5.5 hours, but I enjoyed it the whole time. The gameplay and controls can take some getting used to and I do recommend a controller, but overall I\\'d suggest it if you\\'re a fan of metroidvanias with a bit of a challenge. <3 Great Soundtrack, cute characters, cool boss fight, witch titty, bad and good endings, witch titty, easy to pick up, can be played fast or slow and has witch titty. Great game. It\\'s a good game, although a bit on the shorter side much like the other Momodora games. Un juego que en lo personal me gusto su apartado grafico, me parecio muy agradable. En cuanto a jugabilidad y los niveles me gustaron mucho, las peleas contra jefes estan bastante bien aunque para ser sincero una que otra pelea en la parte final no me parecieron la gran cosas o se me hicieron muy sencillas a comparacion de algunas anteriores pero en general me parecio muy genial y lo recomiendo bastante. Really nice game, good movement, great story, but the only bad thing is that is too short, just that, but it\\'s amazing, specially if you like Metroidvanias. I really enjoyed this game. It was hard for me in the beginning but started to understand the patterns later on in the game. The game is kinda short, you can finish it within 3-5 hours. Also, the art in the game is really nice. Overall I recommend you try it out. Game is well hard when you first touch it, but stick with it and once you\\'ve got the flow of how the game works, you\\'ll find a charming little metroidvania. Looked really nice but I simply was not having any fun with this game. This is not to say its bad but its just not my Jam. Nothing made me say \"wow thats cool\" It was all just meh. From the sound effects to the music and even the baddies are all just Meh. This could just be a me thing but I would not recamend it Starts kinda slow, but gets a lot better, specially after the first stage.\\nI would have loved to know more about the characters and the world. Is a great game, a little short, if you know what you have to do you can finish it in less than three hours, yet it is fun to play and hard to master, specially in higher difficulties, if you like a challenge and a fun one too, play the game. I was honestly surprised how much I enjoyed this game. It\\'s an absolute joy to play and I enjoyed all of it. Despite it\\'s short playtime, it\\'s worth every dollar. Great game and kinda hard metroidvania, at least until you get used to the game. GOOD Its good :) Fun Metroid-Vania type thing. The art in this game is phenomenal, but that\\'s it. \\nThe gameplay is extremely disappointing: combat is slow and repetitive; boss fights drag on forever; exploring the map is unrewarding; insta-kill spikes on a METROIDVANIA; insconsistent rules (for example, there\\'s a underwater level and a room where water kills you instantly); the list of questionable design choices go on.\\n A quaint metroidvania that has lovely graphics and music that adds to the atmosphere. \\n\\nIn terms of gameplay it\\'s difficult enough for me at normal to have a good time but not beat me into the dirt (and I am kinda bad at these kinds of games.) so if these types of games are your bread and butter you might want to give it a shot a slightly higher difficulty to have a nice challenge. \\n\\nThe combat system isn\\'t too overly complex but this is a 4-5 hour game and then new game+ and achivements after that so I don\\'t think it needs more stuff thrown in.\\n\\nThe controls are responsive and feel crisp.\\n\\nAll in all, a good game that has made me interested in the other games the developer has made. cute, relatively short metroidvania. Good shit Compact metroidvania, good for a slow saturday/sunday.\\nGood level design. Good atmosphere. Good music. Short (6ish hrs) but doesn\\'t outstay its welcome. Rudimentary combat. Another fun metroidvania with a really slick art and animation style. reverie(noun): a state of being pleasantly lost in one\\'s thoughts; a daydream.\\n\\nYou won\\'t have time to think on harder difficulties.\\n\\n---\\n\\nA meteroidvania with much variety in difficulty  levels. Good pixel art, music and gameplay.\\n[spoiler]True end made me sad :([/spoiler] Cute sprites, fun game play, music was great too An excellent, straightforward platformer/metroidvania.  Gradually unlock new abilities and access new parts of the map and fight a variety of interesting bosses. Exelent gameplay and fun exploration. Well worth the money good 2 hour or so game 8/10 Fantastic game, though the ending leaves a lot to be desired great metroidvania In my opinion this game is fantastic (Shit made me nut). From the art style getting an overhaul to the gameplay change to the large map I get to explore to the characters that bring this world to life, I love everything. Momodora 4 brings all the best qualities from the previous titles: The difficultly from the first game in the platforming and enemy placement, the satisfaction of exploration and finding hidden items in the map from the second even if it was small scale along with the npcs that bring the game to life, and being able to equip items to alter gameplay to your style from the third. Not to mention new game plus. The fourth game is a delightful mix of the strongest qualities baked into a delicious gamer cake.\\n\\nI legitimately struggled to find the one thing to nitpick. Sometimes when fighting multiple enemies I get hit because I’m stuck in animation from hitting them and I can’t defend myself. I can’t really think of anything else.\\n\\nFull Video: https://youtu.be/gsTofQIp2LI The art and the music are incredible, also very fun and challenging in some parts. Came into this game knowing nothing, only saw the trailer. It is 100% worth your money. Very good game. Sad that it\\'s over. 通关一次之后看了疯狂模式速通视频感觉就这操作自己也可以做到而兴致勃勃的去尝试的我深深的发现了一件事\\n我是傻逼 Very good stuff. Crushed it 3 times. good times Great gameplay, great style and great history Loved it Gameplay is hard, I can totally accept it, I\\'ve played way harder games. But there must be at least a reason for this massive HP decrease and instant death on spikes. Do remember if I don\\'t save before I die I have to re-experience a whole bunch of things just to get to where I was after a hard walkthrough, elite, or even bosses. It\\'s a huge waste of time. \\nHP increase doesn\\'t help gameplay at all, and there\\'s a bigger problem on creativity of enemies as well. If player died \"unreasonable\" then there\\'s a major issue with the game. Don\\'t expect us to experience Ninja Gaiden once more just to prove we are \"top-notch\" gamers. We\\'re not. It\\'s a new gen now, and it\\'s ok to look back to the old times, but make sure what to follow and what not to -- I mean, even Ninja Gaiden had some sort of FTR to prevent instant death and abadons the game. Why ain\\'t this game anyways? The same problem happens in Minoria, so do pay attention.\\nI do like the visual and would like to see more, so will finish the game afterwards. Fun metroidvania with a great art style. It\\'s a bit short though, and has a couple of bosses that are pretty tough until you get their patterns memorized. Those might be good things though. Means you can actually finish the game with out spending a zillion hours and it still give you a challenge. \\nWish there were more secrets to find. I finished at 98%. Momodora: RUtM is a tightly made, visually pleasing metroidvania. It\\'s story is succinct,  but well constructed and deeply woven into the environment you play in. From the cheery forests outside the dreary city to the forlorn monastery. Not only are the environments here well designed, but the music compliments each area well. Some bosses are absolutely terrible if you wish to perfect them, but clever use of items can get you very far in this regard. Overall, I give this 5/5.  . Absolute hidden gem. It\\'s pretty short and sweet with a ton of polish and with a lot of fun boss fights. This is one of the few games I find myself coming back to and really enjoying every time. It\\'s a really fun metroidvania that I think goes under the radar with really fun combat mechanics, boss fights, and combat. The soundtrack and game is gorgeous. Noice Good little platformer! Can be a tiny bit hard sometimes, but you can finish it in under 3 hours.\\n\\nALSO! Beautiful pixel art. Decently challenging, on Hard you might die more times than you\\'d like. I love the setting, the graphics, the characters and the music. Would recommend. fantastic game! Bored, dont buy it, its a little funny at the first days, but just wait a week and then you are going to feel really bored with this game. This game is a very simple one. A fun experience with very compelling story elements. The characters and art style are incredibly thematic and charming. I recommend this game to people who want to sit back and have a classic side-scroller RPG without all the mess of some of the more modern titles. the only bad part is the controls What a damn fun game, I have to acknowledge that it is pretty short (took me 7-8 hours to 100% it). But my god was it worth it. It provides a nice challenge but nothing impossible (I played on hard difficulty on my first playthrough and I only struggled a bit in the beginning. Such fluid controls, satisfying sound effects during battles, great animations, fantastic design of characters and enemies, and the cherry on top of it all is the absolutely astounding soundtrack. Loved every second of it, can\\'t wait to see more games in the future Great game, art and music are also great, everything is great praise the developers good game a bit slow in parts wher you have to do a lot of backtracking\\n\\nbut plenty of secrets and upgrades for those who like that and metroidvania style \\n\\nfeel the combat and bosses could be improved in parts, in terms of variety of attacks and defense they used (once you know the bossess three main attacks, you can beat it pretty easily, although I only played on normal and hard difficulty) Even in normal, it gave me a run for my money at times, leaving me frustrated even.\\nBut man, even though I, at the time of writing this review, have only played 5 hours, that was time well spent on a visually stunning, fun and eccentric Metroidvania. I don\\'t know if I should have played the other Momodora games in order, but I\\'ll definitely invest money into rdein\\'s previous and future projects. Thank you very much for this work of art. A beautiful combination of fantastic world design and a reimagining of nostalgic gaming concepts. yeet Fun to play, will probably play through a few more times on higher difficulties\\n1 issue, standard controls, though mostly just my preference and was easily changed\\n9/10 Good difficulty and nice world building. One of my favourite games which contains one of my favourite boss fights ever, Pardoner Fennel, the game peaks at that point, the music, the character design, the opening dialogue, the fact that its only you and her and she\\'s the same size, it\\'s all perfect to make one of the most enjoyable boss fights i\\'ve ever had. A boosfight that also leaves a sour taste in the end because fighting her isnt something anyone actually wanted A really solid pocket length Metroidvania.\\nAlthough it might receive flack for minimal upgrades, it makes up for it with solid base gameplay.\\nWhen upgrades are found, they feel special and useful.\\nDifficulty is well tuned throughout. Tough to start with, deserving respect later on.\\nSounds have impact and weight and the atmospheric music and stereo panning is immersive.\\nVisually the game is well drawn too, with a beautiful colour palette and slick animation.\\nStage design is varied in aesthetic and creatively designed throughout with well paced check points.\\nI\\'ve played most games considered to be in this genre and this a good one.\\nPerfect for squeezing in a quick hour of gameplay in before bed.\\n fun game would recomend if on sale also the titboxes are accurate This is a solid Castlevania-like game with a melancholic atmosphere and story. If you\\'re into such action platformers, I highly recommend it! Fun and challenging metroidvania like game that has fantastic pixel art, animations, game mechanics, and story. You play a priestess named Kaho, who fights with a leaf to vanquish enemies. Seeking out a way to stop a curse wrought on her home land. Don\\'t want to spoil much, but even the start of the game is quite difficult, but fun. Cons:\\nForget playing on Hard mode, Normal mode isn\\'t even fun either, combat is the worst.\\n\\nThere are points in the combat where you are fighting an enemy, and you just randomly take damage without any hint of movement. You can\\'t choregraph some of the enemies, and some of the placement of the enemies is really aggravating to deal with. (The main point of a shield enemy, is to dodge behind it and kill it, but they sometimes put a wall behind the shield enemy, and expect you to kill it. Tell me how this is great game design?)\\n\\nSince I think this is a console port, playing with a controller is so much better than on a keyboard. I am used to FPS though, maybe it\\'s just because I\\'m out of my element. \\n\\nLastly some of the enemy types:\\nThe poison throwers, you can shoot the poisonous explosive out of the air, and even though you shot it right next to the enemy that threw it, and it exploded in their face, it doesn\\'t do any damage.\\nThe shield + dagger enemies. They throw a dagger, and immediately can block after their attack. You would dodge behind them after their attack and immediately recover and counter your backstab. \\n\\n(This wasn\\'t a problem with the game, but seeing how cheerful the reviews were, it kind of put me into a false sense of enjoyment, and it was a big part in buying a game, I play deplorable, unfinished games that have awful reviews, and I\\'ve honestly had more fun in those broken games, than struggling with this pitiful combat system.)\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nIt\\'s got great atmospheric music, and it\\'s really relaxing, but the sound design is nothing special,\\nThe background art is very pleasing to the eye, the environment hits a sweet spot. Fantastic, short, and somewhat challenging. A unique and fun metroidvania with a hidden story. Very enjoyable. Fourth installment in the Momodora series. Prequel to the first game, but still a standalone title. Prior knowledge of the previous games is NOT required.\\n\\nPlot: \\nA Priestess named Kaho travels to the Kingdom of Karst to seek audience with the Queen in hopes of finding a way to stop a curse that\\'s been spreading across the land and is affecting her village...\\n\\nGameplay: \\nJump, double jump, 3-hit melee combo, ranged shots with bow and arrows. Arrows chargeable for more damage. Lots of upgrades and items for various movement, attacks, protection, and healing. Fight your way through the enemies of each area in search of the boss.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n2D pixelated art style. Gorgeous scenery. Every area has its own aesthetic and there\\'s no mistaking when you enter a new area. \\n\\nAudio:\\nFirst time I ever bought the game\\'s OST so I hope that shows you how good the music is. The sound effects are pleasing to hear (I have the Item Get sound as my phone\\'s text notification sound, it\\'s so perfect.) The main character\\'s scream whenever you die is so ear splitting it makes you want to try even harder to keep her alive.\\n\\nBonus:\\nYou can play as a freakin\\' cute cat. Why have you not bought the game yet? Short and sweet a quick platformer / metrovania. All the bosses play fair and it can be fun to learn all the patterns. If you like these kind of game it is highly recomended short but fun Short but awesome, just like the main character. i could have played castlevania is good The cats are too cute. This game I randomly stumbled across while watching a stream, and might I say, it is an exceptional game. The sprite work is some of the best I have seen in a game, and the environments are all unique and fun to explore. The story was also very interesting, and the way the game portrayed it was again amazing. I highly recommend this game, with a solid 10/10 rating. Short and sweet. Good casual fun. If you are into Metroid-style games, then you will probably find this at least somewhat enjoyable. \\n\\nI was mostly entertained throughout, but didn\\'t care enough after beating it to play through again on games+. \\n\\nPick it up on sale. good Great soundtrack, pleasing graphics and challenging but fair game play. Love the game to bits Fantastic Metroidvania it keeps drawing me in! It\\'s a good 4 hours of your time. A bit simple, wish there was a remix zone/inverted castle, but it doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. Pick it up if you have a hankering for a metroidvania. fun and cute Everything you want from a Metrovania style game. Is a tad bit difficult but take your time with enemies and bosses then its a blast. The eclectic group of too difficulty in alot of sub areas and by-the manual boss battles.\\n\\nI cant recommend this to anyone with board certified respectful encouragement Short and fun. Combat and platforming feels tight. Wish there were more bosses. leaf game Short, but really fun! Combat is juicy and fun, with delicious impacts on every hit. Would highly recommend for anyone keen for a challenging game (and loves cats!). Fun game with good-ish combat and fantastic visuals/sprites. When this game decides that you die, you die.  Boss fights are more luck and randomness than anything else.  The game goes for the punishing Dark Souls feel, but I never felt like my fate was in my hands, and I never felt like when I died to a boss that \"oh that was me\".  I got to an early boss and wasted about 90 minutes on her. Tried range attacks, tried following her patterns & countering attacking, then ultimately gave up and spammed her.  Strangely, spamming her caused her to do almost no damage, until the game decided nope, she OHK you with the same attack.\\n\\nI felt the whole time while playing this game that there was some element I was missing, some element that made the game about skillful combat but I couldn\\'t figure it out.  I\\'ve beaten all 3 Dark Souls more times than I can count, beaten Salt and Sanctuary more times that I can count, and I\\'ve gotten platinum in Siekro--but this game\\'s combat just felt too random for me to endure it.\\n\\nUpdate: \\nOver a long weekend stuck in a hotel with nothing to do, I booted this game back up and beat it.  It was still more of a chore than anything else. One-hit kill boss battles are just not fun, and the lack of metroidvania upgrades or abilities really make this game feel a 8-bit game from another era that is something else entirely.

Achei o jogo todo muito bem feito - visual do jogo, gameplay, os upgrades e o senso de exploração e descoberta. A história e atmosfera também não deixaram a desejar. Pode ir jogar feliz! 10/10 best wifus great game if you love Castlevania, then i see no reason you won\\'t like this one, give it a try! Short and sweet! A couple of unique mechanics and a good amount of polish make it worth snagging on sale. Art is nice, game play is smooth and fun. Game is overall not too long and somewhat easy even on the highest difficulty. Worth a play if you like platformers and or metroid like games. A short, sweet metroidvania by a two-person studio, it has a lovely soundtrack and excellent background worldbuilding ala Hollow Knight, but much less forgiving platforming given that Momodora\\'s spike pits are instadeath, even if they are easy to avoid.\\n\\nOverall, the controls feel both floaty and weighty, which should be a bad mix but somehow works really well for the game. Your melee hits do significant hitstun, even against bosses, but your combo has significant cooldown after it completes or you drop/cancel it, so I wasn\\'t able to lock anyone into an inescapable pattern.\\n\\nThe whole game is beautiful in a SNES sort of way, but I wish it was a bit more modern with its minimap. You can tell which rooms you\\'ve explored and which ones you haven\\'t (which is a step up on Skautfold), but you can\\'t tell which rooms have secrets/npcs---even if you can tell which rooms have hidden exits, due to them showing up on the map.\\n\\nUltimately, if you like the aesthetic or if you\\'re looking for a warmup before trying something much harder like Hollow Knight, this is an excellent playthrough and fully worth the price.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t like the aesthetic, or if you need exp/stats/grindable progression, something like Skautfold or Bloodstained might suit you better instead. Well it is another Momodora. Nice platforming-game, with nice art and controls. It is a bit short, but it doesn\\'t cost much, so worth it. Great game, it\\'s a short, pretty and fun metroidvania. a nice game, if not a little simple.\\nits a nice casual metroidvania.\\nplay the previous games first. As of writing this review, it\\'s my favorite metroidvania of all time. Short, challenging, beautifully animated, great characters. Fennel is my favorite. I think I just like games with simple controls and no stat progression. It\\'s like a pixelated 2D version of Bloodborne. Only it\\'s more cutesy. And the \"background world building\" isn\\'t too cohesive, making most of the item descriptions more vague than they need to be.\\n\\nBut yeah, overall, the artstyle is very good. The enemies are detailed, the backgrounds too. The bosses are sort of challenging. There are boobies, but I think you\\'ve already noticed.\\n\\nIt\\'s good for what it is. Go buy. Very good. Im suprised how dark and creepy this game can get.  \\nYou get one mele and one ranged attack.  For the most part, they don\\'t change.\\nYou do get spells and equipable trinkets as powerups.  \\nA fun and competent metroidvania. Fun, simple metroidvania with nice bosses and a variety of power ups. I did not put enough hours into this game. I\\'ll return to it eventually. Right after I figure out how to kill that boss. Brasileiros, nos façam um favor e comprem esta pérola para ajudar nossos desenvolvedores. Everybody else, I\\'ll just say this: \"It\\'s really worth the munny\" My less-than 1 hour experience was on hard mode.\\nThe game likes to kill you. It doesn\\'t give you a fair challenge most of the time, it just likes to deal damage to you. It can be very unfair and I had to die over and over until I learned where the next special thing would pop up to kill me by surprise, so I could try to avoid it. The very first level is already like this, the second escalates immensely. I like challenging game with a high skill ceiling, but this was just frustrating and annoying. Maybe the game would be bearable on easy mode but I can\\'t change the difficulty without starting over. A short game, but very well done. One of the most pleasant and charming metroidvanias i ever played. Also has the cutest cat sprites ever made. It was great. Play it. Very responsive controls, and beautiful animations. Cute, little metroidvania.\\nIt\\'s pretty short, but that also means it doesn\\'t outstay its welcome.\\nMost of the powerups are more about increasing combat ability than about movement and exploration.\\nThe story and look is like if Touhou took place in Lordran (or Dark Souls took place in Gensokyo...).\\n\\nBiggest problem is the music. It\\'s not bad, per se, but some of the tracks are so grim and funereal they\\'re actually inappropriate. This is a cute, if slightly melancholy, game with adorable sprite graphics and anime girls, not Silent Hill!\\n\\nStill, it\\'s a good time, with lovely graphics and a nice atmosphere. Give it a try, it\\'s worth it. A decent refreshing platformer. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight  is a satisfying game that hits all its marks as an indie game. Quality pixel art animations and tight attacks and gameplay will see most players to the end. The story is fairly dry and bread crumbed but with a mostly female cast of enemies and npc’s there is still some uniqueness to this otherwise pretty standard game for its genre. It is fairly short and streamlined as the content feels slightly lacking. The playtime is fairly short and most players will get it done within a couple sessions, (3 if you are a completionist). Despite all this I will still recommend this game because I still had fun with it and would love to see what further works can come from Bombservice Moving BGM,That is all. Very well crafted little platformer. Lots of content despite the small size. There is some backtracking but it\\'s not that bad since you get a warp feature after some time. I loved it even though I found it quite difficult even on normal, but after some time I got the hang of it and when the items started piling up the game got easier. Would have loved if it was the other way around since with time you get the hang of it and start seeing patterns and learning the controls. Highly recommended. God damn masterpiece. Impressive music and design, tho a bit short\\nmakes me want more. Great game, the best momodora game out. I usually dont play metroidvania type games but i really loved this one. I\\'d highly recommend to anyone who likes the genre or even to someone who doesnt! A good Metrovidian.\\n I really enjoyed this game a lot! the mechanics are really smooth and well thought out and the art and soundtrack is beautiful... Its not a very long game but its definitely worth your time It\\'s fun, The music is nice, exploration is rewarding, movement is satisfying, and the pixel sprites are clean af. Combat can feel a little repetitive after awhile though. and it\\'s rather short for a metrovania but it\\'s still a good time and worth the pricetag Meh... Nice game, the soundtrack kicks ass and chews bubblegum. Love it whenever i feel like these type of games this is my go to game. Addictive mechanics, challenges and levels.\\nGreat and yet simple story.\\nLong enough to enjoy the adventure, but short enough to have progress and achievment feeling for casual gamers.\\nA lot of replayability. While I have not played the previous games in the series, Momodora came as a suprise to me for being very well done in style, game play, and music. It hits all the check-boxes that makes a good metroidvania title that can easily be completed in a couple days.\\n\\nThe game focuses as you, a priestist of Lun, tasked with traveling to a nearby kingdom to help rid your people of a terrible curse. As you arrive, you find out that the nearby kingdom is scourged with the same curse and riddled with monsters and a depressing setting which contrasts well with the cute nature you think the game will be. There are few NPCs in the entire game, but the little dialog they do provide helps support the bleak setting you are thrust into.\\n\\nGameplay wise, the game is an action platform where you can use a (HOLY) maple leaf to smack your foes about, and a charge-up bow to hit them from afar. Some enemies get stunned and are easy to kill while others require you to dodge and attack which keeps you on your toes at all times. There are also a few powerups (air dodge, spells, potions, rings, etc) but none that really shook up game play for me to a great degree. I would have liked to see more meaningful power-ups but I\\'m not sure if this is just a staple of the series or not.\\n\\nDifficulty isn\\'t too terrible. I found the game to be challenging mostly with bosses which require you to read their attacks via trial and error but none that posed too much of a threat with the right equipment set-up. I could have sworn I wrote a review on this game when I first played it, so forgive me for not including direct examples for anything.\\n\\nThis game, legitimately, is awful. I have absolutely no idea what anyone sees in this garbage. The combat isn\\'t enjoyable in any way, enemy design is boring and at times borderline ridiculous (two boss fights are giant women whom you need to smack their tits to kill them), the metroidvania exploratory aspects of the game are near non-existent, the game is very challenging in a boring play-it-super-safe kind of way, there are no interesting weapons or attacks. I generally don\\'t give a shit about story but this game has absolutely none at all(yet the box art/steam art makes it look like some grand adventure with many wacky and interesting characters). \\n\\nI just, I don\\'t get it. There are plenty of other metroid style games out there that are so much better than this.\\n\\nEdit: Oh yeah, the name is stupid, too. How pretentious do you need to be to name your 2-6 hour game MOMODORA: REVERIE UNDER THE MOON LIGHT, like it\\'s some grand adventure or something. I feel like the number of words in a game title shouldn\\'t exceed the hours it takes to complete it on a normal playthrough. nicu pretty good, i kinda like everything. don\\'t go into it if you are looking for an easy game though A fun little platformer, although compared to momodora 3, there\\'s little incentive to replay the game unless for true ending [spoiler] which is quite easy to get too [/spoiler] and 100% achievement, but since it\\'s fun, I don\\'t mind it too much Amazing game, especially if you appreciate old school platformers [i]YES[/i] งานภาพและดนตรีประกอบคือสมบรูณ์แบบ\\nเกมนี้มีจบสองแบบ\\nมีความท้าทาย ในการเดินทางและต่อสู้เพราะการsaveต้องทำที่จุดsaveในแมพ\\nโดยรวมถือว่าเยี่ยมยอดแต่ศัตรูจับทางง่ายไปหน่อย this game is make but 1 guy but the 1st game was like cave story mod (he said it was mod) and the the second game was different and 1,2 is on itch but with a different name and free then a third game he change his name (i think pze comment on this if i was incorrect) and it\\'s on steam same name of the game\\'s and this is the fourth with a different game and the game it have 2 ending\\'s (i did the good ending by being me) and 1,2,3 game\\'s look cute and dark at the same time but this game is dark pf the darkness and cute the maker of this game\\'s you can find all the game\\'s he did on https://www.bombservice.com/ it\\'s only 5 game\\'s now <(update on this) and as u see it\\'s good. A short and sweet game with an excellent soundtrack.  The beginning might be a bit tricky because you\\'re barely starting off and only die in a few hits, but with a few attempts at spots you get KO\\'d in, you should be able to persevere.  A vastly underappreciated gem. SO FRIGGIN GOOD The best designed Metroidvania I\\'ve ever played. Seriously. This game may be short, but it makes up for it by being so incredibly good. Hollow Knight may have way more content, but even then, I would put these two games equal to each other in terms of quality.\\n\\nAlso, one of the very very few cases where you can unironically say \"its the dark souls of <genre>\". The inspirations are clear, and work well. It feels great to play, difficulty is hard but completely fair.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this game is the boob which is very cheesy and probably drives away a lot of people from playing the game. Which is a shame because more people should play this. Absolutely stunning game.\\nBeautiful pixel art and music create a great atmosphere through every area.\\nGameplay is really satisfactory, you might die at the start while you get a grip of the movement and attacks, but once you get used to it you realize how tight the controls and combat are. \\nNon-linear exploration also allows you to play however you want, without the game baby-ing you around. \\nVery recommended, pick up the OST if you can as well. Very good Metroidvania game! \\n\\n-Nice fluid movement\\n-Nice artstyle\\n-Nice soundtrack\\n-Cheap and dosent take to long to finish Just a beautiful challenging but still a relaxing game. I played it in 1 sitting but has a lot of replayability if you wanna. Its awesome 10/10 gonna play again :3 This game makes my pee pee hard. it is a good game this game is really fucking good fun, pretty, interesting game Another amazingly drawn pixel platformer which fails to deliver in the gameplay. Play it on Hard and have a good time. nice Nice, cute Game, good difficulty on Normal, not too hard but challenging enough to keep you interested. About 5 hours for a first blind playthrough. Really good Gamefeel, Story is almost non existent (like the older metroidvanias this seems to go for). Beatifull Art, Game is only playable in 4:3, doesnt make the game worse at all. Quite an excellent game. Having to beat all bosses without getting hit in order to get the best items can be quite troublesome, but certainly not impossible. I enjoyed my time with this game. Solid game for 4 bucks, atmospheric, tight movement and controls, some variety in bosses ranging from big whole screen types involving hitting boobs with leaves  to the more close combat 1 v 1 same size as your sprite type fights.  Enjoyed one play through, will play more; apparently I didn\\'t do well enough the first time through. Good animation, good gameplay, poorly made story A very fun, if short, Metroidvania style game with gorgeous pixel art and very nice music. The story is sparse but it works for the tone it\\'s trying to set. The bosses are all unique looking and quite challenging, although the game offers an easy mode that makes it accessible to enjoy for just about anyone. Definitely worth checking out :) It be cute :3 Good game that also have cats in it  The 4th of the Momodora Games, this one is the Opus of the rest. It\\'s a bit of a run but not too long. It\\'s got enough variety to not be dull, and enough jumping about to not be tedious, and not hard enough to make you give up before finding the end of the story. \\n\\nIt\\'s a good run. The best yet. I expected a somewhat fun game, not a reminder of why i enjoy gaming. Amazing experience! I plan to recommend this game to any gaming friends I have. A very nice and challenging platform game. Great animations and vast ways to play the game! Good Game. Yeah it\\'s cool This is fun. Just Buy. Consume.\\n\\nHonestly. It just a great game with nice pixel art, great music and nice boss fights. The Pardoner is the best personally. I bit frustrating. Needs different difficulty modes. After you die so many times it becomes a waste of time. Other games to move onto. The graphics and music really set the atmosphere and the combat against bosses are a mix of challenge and fun. I enjoyed the insanity mode since it makes you focus the timing with dodging and timing your hits. TL;DR: Not hard, just tedious. Gorgeous art tho\\n\\nLong version: Almost all of the difficulty in the game comes from one of the following sources\\n- Enemies/bullets that appear from nowhere, forcing you to memorize their locations\\n- Instadeath spikes in locations that aren\\'t especially challenging, but which will cause you to replay the last 5-10 minutes if you touch them\\n- Save points and shortcuts that are extremely scarce, and one-way paths that are fairly abundant, forcing you to navigate through large portions of each area over and over again just to get around\\n- Having to backtrack through old areas (not looking for secrets, just to get around), then getting hit while you\\'re zoned out\\n- Solutions to these problem (eg fast movement, fast travel with bells) being only available in the last third to quarter of the game, once you stop needing them, and not being very effective at their job even then\\n\\nNothing in the game ever really felt challenging; even the final boss and secret boss were pretty easy. Those fights are at least kind of interesting conceptually, but the vast majority of the game is not in those fights, and as outlined above, there isn\\'t much else to it. For most of the time I was playing, I was either bored or mildly frustrated; it felt like the game was trying its hardest to make me zone out, but the game punishes you for doing so with level design that forces you to slowly backtrack through old areas and memorize exact enemy locations. \\n\\nAt this point there are just lots of better action platformers, even by the same publisher (check out Touhou Luna Nights, which has none of these problems). Play something with better level design, more engaging movement and combat mechanics, boss fights that are actually challenging, etc. Not particularly fair (lots of instant death) , but also not very hard either. The \"metriodvania\" aspect is not really there; it\\'s pretty linear with some backtracking. That being said, it has kind of a nice aesthetic and decent music. incredible metroidvania good anime / cave story aesthetic Nice. Nice Metroidvania game Momodora is game good yes Gameply, music n shit is all kewl. But if you get attached easily nah fam dont play shits sad. Absolutely amazing. Very fun and responsive game!\\nLove the art style, and the character design! Amazing game. Great atmosphere, responsible controls. Recalls the great metroidvanias such as Hollow Knight. Highly recommended. And also: the music is so good. 8.5/10 Everyone should play this game. the controls are tight, the game play is difficult but rewarding. The music is amazing, the best of the entire series. If you have never played any of the Momodora series, I recommend this one to be your first. some deaths can be unfair, but you lose very little progress if you save at every chance you get. One real problem is the fact that it is extremely easy to get lost even with the map, so I found myself regularly losing my sense of direction and the locations of shops. even with that the jump in visuals from the previous game to this one makes up for it, making me not care about going the wrong way. this is definitely a purchase you won\\'t regret. Good game, worth the couple of dollars for it A fun little metroidvania style game. Short but sweet. It has the semi-maze like level design and backtracking after you get keys and new methods to access previous areas that the genre is known for and I\\'m not a huge fan of that but just pulling up a map online helps out with that part.\\n\\nArt style goes a long way to give it some charm and the combat is pretty enjoyable for the length that the game takes to complete. In the spirit of Cave Story, a metroidvania with depth, nice graphics and an interesting universe. I really enjoyed it. I\\'ve enjoyed my time with Momodora: RUTM and loved playing through this interesting and wonderfully macabre world. If you don\\'t like Metroidvania\\'s, it could be a nice introductory point for the genre due to it\\'s relatively small over world and most abilities are fairly simple. There are dozens of collectables nearly everywhere, from beating bosses without taking damage, to giving unexpected things to unexpected people, I have barely found half of the stuff possible. The skills and abilities found throughout the different parts of the kingdom really add to the game play especially in boss fights, which I think are a highlight of the game. The pixelated art style adds more atmosphere to the game, by letting your imagination fill in the gaps that the blocky squares don\\'t, and the more detailed sprites, like on the aforementioned bosses, really add a sense of depth to the pixels, as well as stellar designed backgrounds. Over all I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice, brief, atmospheric world to drop themselves in for a little while, as long as they can keep a sharp eye out for secrets. A challenging sidescroller with loads of character. The graphics are a fine example of elegance in simplicity. The only flaw as far as I can tell is that you can\\'t skip cutscenes (and if you\\'re as bad as I am you may have to rewatch them a bunch of times). Highly recommend. I absolutely love this game\\'s atmosphere. Words can\\'t describe just how well this game captured a feeling that even triple A titles can\\'t. Something about pixels just makes the game that more expressive than modern graphics. control a bit weird with the keyboard--why is jump and up different? but otherwise a fun game to play Fantastically rich Metroidvania experience. Really great game. The only downside is the length being pretty short, but for 10$ it\\'s a steal if you\\'re into Metroidvanias. Great art and fun boss fights. A somber Metroidvania with an adorable presentation and a dark story. Not terribly long or complicated, but what it does it does excellently and is well-worth the 3-to-6 hour investment for at least the one playthrough. Love the main character and the cute side characters. Excellent gameplay, great controls, amazing soundtrack. Highly recommended to anyone who likes Castlevania style games. A Classic Stunning and Story-rich Masterpiece.\\nMomodora was once a game with the roots of a Cave Story type platformer. \\nIn Reverie Under the Moonlight,\\nMomodora evolves into its own chilling metrodevania dungeon crawler with several areas and one thorough objective. It feels unique and interesting to play. I love this game but my friend hates it. *Eminem- Stan starts playing* *Starts to cry* This game actually is good but I suck at playing it. I haven\\'t beaten the first level and I had this game since 2018. good Another souls-like Metroidvania!! The art style is nice and the sound design builds a good atmosphere. Game-play is solid and feeling kinda similar to the souls \"don\\'t rush it\" formula. Patience is required otherwise you\\'ll get annoyed with the mechanics. Contact damage from enemies is questionable!! Not sure it\\'s needed and can add a cheapness to the combat! Boss fights and many other moments in the game require death to learn what\\'s going on. Again, this feels very cheap as do the boss fights which seem to happen way more often than they need to. All i ever shout is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!! Honestly, it\\'s just not cool...\\n\\nFighting a boss that starts flashing to warn for an attack is fine but when the attack is a massive explosion around the enemy that your witnessing for the first time you just get one hitted, despite having all health upgrades. Dark Souls animates their bosses and adds sound ques so you KNOW something big is about to happen. This is lost in pixel art 2D...and so you die!\\n\\nBut overall, exploration and combat with upgrades sprinkled around make it very much a game that can be hard to put down. It annoys me as much as entertains me. Worth grabbing in a sale but be prepared, this isn\\'t anywhere as balanced and enjoyable as a real souls game. There is jank...and it feels like the dev was probably bullied as a child. It can be a rough time... 6/10 (It\\'s a short game to...only expect between 4-7 hours of gameplay!) Played 1 hour so far and I am loving this game. A very simplified MetroidVania game that can be fully explored and beaten in only a few hours which is great if you want to have fun but don\\'t want to spend a lot of time getting through it.\\nThis game has the standard MetroidVania elements, such as, health and weapon upgrades, hidden collectibles, secret areas, the ability to warp between save points, some moderately difficult boss fights, a difficulty setting, and features more than one ending.\\nThe difficulty overall is challenging but never to a point where you feel like you won\\'t be able to progress or that you\\'ll want to quit for good.\\n Fun game, beautiful graphics, challenging difficulty, crappy ending. You\\'ll have fun, but seriously, the ending sucks, you\\'re warned. Short and sweet Metroidvania (heavier on the \\'vania than the Metroid). It took me about 4.5 hours to beat the game and uncover 100% of the map, but there\\'s still new game+ and some insanely hard achievements to pursue if you\\'re the sort of gamer who does that sort of thing. I\\'m not really that sort of gamer, but the gameplay here is fun enough that I can easily see doing that. yeah its alright 👍 it good It won\\'t blow your mind, but it is an enjoyable MetroidVania that is better than most.  \\nI died a lot. Snappy, polished and well paced Short and sweet, difficulty is also just right. Momodora is a wonderfully made, pick-up-and-play Metroidvania that scratches the action platformer itch, provides tons of cute sprites, tough enemies and obstacles, stark art direction, and great music.\\n\\nI was able to almost 100% the first run in about 8 hours. There\\'s a New Game+ and optional rewards you get for beating bosses without getting hit, so there\\'s plenty of challenge to the game, without overloading you with content like a lot of modern games do.\\n\\nThis game could easily have worked on the DS, or maybe even GBA with some retooling, and I love that. It\\'s rare to find lovingly-crafted pixels and expressive 2-D animation.\\n\\nIf I had to nitpick it, I want to see more spheres and forms! If the Momodora team ever builds a map on the size of the DS Castlevania games and does more with forms (or perhaps other characters... hint hint!), I\\'ll get it in a heartbeat! As it stands, I will probably only need to play through this one or two more times to experience everything. But it\\'s been a breath of fresh air, and I recommend it to any self-respecting Metroidvania player. tight gameplay, beautiful pixel art, and great sound design with a soundtrack to match. one of my favourite metroidvanias. good Low impact. I went through the various areas, defeating the bosses, but it didn\\'t manage to get me invested, so it felt like I was going through the motions. This would have been fine, but the fighting and movement mechanics are too simple to hold the game up. Good metroidvania style game.  Reactive controls, and the enemies and bosses feel fair.  Not terribly long, maybe 4-8 hours depending on how quickly you pick up boss patterns and how close to 100% you want to get.\\nI\\'d suggest using a controller. The keyboard controls are a little weird and you can\\'t use a mouse.  You can remap keyboard controls if you don\\'t have a controller. This game was amazing, it had a wonderful atmosphere and the music was very good. I listen to the music outside the game, which I don\\'t do with many games beyond Nier automata. This games developer and their team put soul into this game and I love it. The art style was very nice on the eyes, if I had anything negative to say, it\\'s the slight confusion on getting the \"true\" ending. However I\\'m very dumb and many people easily figured it out. I love the story, the music, the characters, and the art and environment. This game was absolutely worth it and I love seeing a game with a driven team behind it, it\\'s inspiring. This game is worth it, I loved it and I can\\'t recommend it enough. Super fun metroidvania with extremely pretty visuals and wonderful OST. Dang I finished this game? I barely remember it, cept for the titty boss that the devs very smartly featured in the description. Recommended. sim\\napenas\\nsim Simple and beautiful game. It will take you at least 3 hours for a leisure gameplay.\\nProps to the dev team! This game looks beautiful, has great music, and I think there is a nucleus of a great game wanting to emerge from it.\\n\\nHowever, I ground and ground at it for hours and simply don\\'t \\'get\\' how to play this.  I think it is asking me to diligently learn every enemy\\'s moves and pay a lot of attention to the bosses, but the extremely inconsistent hit detection and absolutely punishing amount of damage mean I die endlessly while trying to proceed.  And dying means a painful shrieking scream out of my speakers, which is hugely jarring.\\n\\nMany times I have reached a point where I thought I was doing well, only to succumb to a poor design choice of an instant kill hit before reaching a save point.  Hilariously, there was one boss I completed, walked to the left, puzzled over whether I was looking at a ledge or water or something and figured the game wanted me to explore - so I jumped in the water and instantly died.  Had to play the boss fight over.  Then, a short time later, I discover my character can exist forever under the water for no apparent reason, but only intended water pools.  THIS is the entire game for me.\\n\\nWill things kill me instantly or reward me for walking up and talking to them?  Is one arbitrary path leading to an impossible boss I\\'m not ready for or something else?  Will I be hurt by touching an enemy or not?  Who can say.  And, after enough of this, I\\'m not sure I care anymore.\\n\\nI am punished for doing anything the game designer didn\\'t intend and simply don\\'t have the patience after dying repeatedly to want to wait and learn the boss fights.  I can tell there is a great game here wanting to get out, but it is as if there is a deep almost cultural lexicon which I am missing.\\n\\nIn many ways I *want* there to be a level of uncertainty, but I guess other gamers seem to enjoy a puzzling grind fest.  I get that.  The old Megaman series was a lot like this, but I think I was hoping for something a little more modern Castlevania or Cave Story than old-school difficult.  It probably comes down to whether you want a relaxing game for the weekend after a hard week at work or really need a challenge.\\n\\nThankfully, this was just a random Humble Bundle game for me, so I\\'m not really disappointed in that.  Just admittedly frustrated at the game to the point where I realize I didn\\'t enjoy much of the past few hours in it.  It is a shame, as the game looks so nice, otherwise, I want to enjoy it.\\n\\nIf you *want* that challenge, this is a good short little game to pass a day with. Beautiful platformer pixel art game.The game itself around 4-5 hours long but it really good for just a few developers.I got this game both on steam and Switch. is fun game\\'s gud\\ncan play as a cat\\n10/10 good Screen shake, the game. there no words that I can use to describe how great this game is. if you like metroidvanias, get this game. Really great entry level metroidvania - id strongly recommend it to anyone looking to get into the genre, that perhaps has doubts about the difficulty and scale they are often known for. While Momodora can be challenging with difficulty settings and even special rewards for no-hitting bosses, it can also be played quite casually on low difficulty.\\n\\nMy expectations were exceedingly high going into this game, having consistently seen it recommended in various metroidvania/similar game discussions, and i still found them mostly fulfilled. While the game is gorgeous, the world is poorly laid out for exploration and involves long stretches of the same corridors. Momodora is a difficult game at first but it feels great once you learn the controls.  The bosses\\'ll get cha!  But they each have a pattern, and I\\'d say it\\'s more than fair.  The first one was real aggravating... It\\'s a lot like Hollow Knight, in more ways than one.  Much shorter though.  I beat it in a little under 5 hours.  It was fun and hard to walk away from!  If you get a good deal I\\'d say it\\'s probably worth picking up!  A one time run through this wholly unique game is all you need to appreciete the insane amount of work the devs put into every screen.\\n\\nDont wait, grab it now. Its worth every penny! :) Amazing graphics, especially if you are a fan of pixel graphics. ✪✪☆ Good Game\\nIndie Metroidvania Game. Cute. I love this game! Everything from the art to the animation transitions is very well done. I just wish there was more to the game. It seems a bit short, but otherwise great! Wonderful.\\nMagnific OST!\\n\\n\\nEVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A charming little game that is intelligent enough not to introduce a stamina mechanic or bore you with pointless grind.\\nRecommended. it gud Fantastic game Apparently a pretty good metroidvania. But hides some serious problems.\\n\\nGraphics are superb, music and sound are regular.\\n\\nBut the gameplay...\\n\\nThe game allows you to travel practically anywhere non-linearly. Which boss should you face first? Which items does the game expect you to have?\\n\\nBut the death blow is the difficulty. On normal difficulty you need to hit some enemies three times per basis and there are various enemies at the end of the game that require you to hit them SIX times. STANDARD ENEMIES. With two or three on every screen.\\n\\nThis is so annoying and boring!\\n\\nAlso, boss fights kill the game. There is almost no patterns. Bosses change randomly from one kind of attack to the other with no indication at all of what they will do. This does not allow the player to adapt and many of my boss fights consists on spamming attacks on the boss. There is even two bosses which can be killed spamming arrows.\\n\\nItem animations are too long. Having to heal is troublesome enough. But needing almost a whole second is even more troublesome. It is not cool getting hit in the middle of a healing.\\n\\nDodge skill is dumb. You can dodge, but many enemies attack you twice. So you dodge and... get hit by the second blow. Er... why implement dodge at all, then? Have dodge and let player dodge or simply remove it.\\n\\nA beautiful game with no real testing. Took me around 5 hours to beat the story.\\n\\nTo be honest, I was shocked with how challenging it was in the beginning. I thought it would be a chill game but I was wrong.\\n\\nStill enjoyed it with a gamepad tho.\\n\\nDefinitely play it if it\\'s on sale :) clunky floaty controls\\n\\nnty\\n\\n lindo e gostoso Such a relaxing atmospheric platformer. The retro style with the beautiful music and simple streamlined mechanics make this game a short but sweet masterpiece. Metroidvania Short and Sweet, the essential essence of a Metroidvania. Despite being annoying at times with the save checkpoints, it is an overall great experience for someone just trying to get into the Metroidvania genre. It\\'s Hollow Knight BUT with some well deserved fan service (: love this game, very good, very much recommend very fun game and cute. fun Jogo Fantastico com otima arte e muito boa soundtrack It\\'s a metroidvaniaish, it\\'s fairly bug free, and it\\'s got some interesting level design and bosses. Those are some of the good things, but there\\'s a lot of bad as well IMO and in the end it wasn\\'t enough to save me from eventually just loosing interest.\\n\\nIt\\'s made what is, in my opinion, a critical mistake in the design of pretty much any game that includes a dodge: it\\'s easy to get locked out of having access to your dodge. There are common used animation all of the place that lock the dodge for a moment, and result in attempting to dodge... doing nothing. It\\'s perfectly acceptable for big charge-ups or other powerful moves to lock you out of your dodge, it\\'s easy to learn which abilities those are and be prepared to commit to them if you\\'re going to use them. But attacking twice? You\\'re locked out of the dodge for a period of the second attack?\\n\\nIt lacks a key component of metroidvania games for as far as I got, there aren\\'t abilities that open up the map. Just keys. Now... I\\'ve seen a number of map areas that appear to need abilities to access them... so I\\'m guessing that there are abilities somewhere to access them... but at 46% map completion I\\'d gotten none. At best, there feels like there\\'s a pacing problem somewhere in there.\\n\\nThe story telling felt... just... meh... I simply wasn\\'t pulled in. Then again, I don\\'t play these games for the story telling. I play them for the game play. It was lacking. The game didn\\'t feel fluid, it didn\\'t feel like you had control, it felt like there was an extreme lack control. I realize I set a high standard for this particular genre, as it\\'s one of my favorites... but I just didn\\'t come away from this enjoying my time. Really nice graphics and relaxing music with smooth gameplay I know we like to meme it up with \"haha Dark Souls\" stuff, but this is genuinely an amazing game with a perfect balance of difficulty and gorgeous art, to put games like this and Hollow Knight under the banner of \"Souls-Like\" does massive disservice to the brilliance of them! Definitely one of my favourite indie games. Great metrovania like game This game is a solid Metroidvania, if a bit short. \\n\\nI\\'d have loved a bit more variety in enemies and weapons, but I had fun. A visually pleasing and exciting adventure. The only downsides are forgettable music and slightly clunky controls. Other than that, it\\'s a meticulously crafted game. The primary thing you do in this game is fighting, and the combat system is repetitive, boring, and low-skill. You have two attacks, a melee leaf strike, and a shot with a bow.\\nYou deal with every enemy in exactly the same way:\\n1) You run to melee range, and since every attack stuns them, you just stunlock them to death.\\n2) You stay at a distance and spam arrows until they die.\\n\\nThere\\'s no reason to deviate from this, no reason to vary it up. However, this would be fine, if the enemy design was interesting, alas, this can also be summed up in four different categories:\\n1) Enemies that walk towards you and melee attack you.\\n2) Enemies that throw projectiles or spells in either an arc towards you, or actually targeted.\\n3) Melee enemies that block attacks from the front except when they\\'re attacking.\\n4) Enemies that slowly float towards you and do contact damage/explode.\\n\\nYour only reason for fighting is to earn currency, which is in itself fairly useless.\\nThe next part of combat could be a very redeeming aspect, which is boss fights. Sadly, this is the worst part of Momodora for me. The bosses are just boring slog. They\\'re slow, the attacks are all easily avoided, the telegraphing is extremely inconsistent. To give an example from the same boss, which has 2 melee attacks, one which does roughly 40% of your hp in damage, and one which does 80% of your hp in damage. The former has a long windup + visual effect playing, the latter has one unique frame of animation, quick windup, and no visual effect.\\nIn general, the bosses are slow, have almost no attacks, often very boring ones, can go off-screen/be invulnerable for such long periods of time, that your character literally stands still for long enough to play the idle-fidget animations, one of which is a yawn, which is exactly what the boss fights feel like.\\nAny semblance of difficulty comes completely from the high amount of damage each attack deals, rather than from interesting attacks to dodge. Overall, an extreme disappointment.\\n\\nThis is an easy game, but death is inevitable. Most of the deaths I\\'ve had came from one of two sources:\\n1) Water, which in some places you can, and even must swim in to progress. In other places, the exact same looking water is an instant death.\\n2) Spikes, any platforming mistake is an instant death.\\nDeath sets you back to your last save point, which can be quite a far way back, so it becomes rather tedious.\\n\\nLuckily there are a few things in the game that make me not completely regret spending the time on playing it. Firstly, aesthetically the world is pleasing, and the same goes for the music. The story, while nothing special, is cute enough. The characters you meet give the world some flair, and while I was quite disappointed that they almost never react to any actions you\\'ve taken in the world, it was still rather pleasant. Secondly, there is some decent exploration, and while secrets mostly lack any indication (except for a passive item that chimes when you enter a room with a secret), it\\'s still something I enjoyed, and the main reason I finished the game.\\n\\nOverall, the game is mediocre at best, and I really don\\'t see how it received such universal acclaim. This game made me happy. This game has been a big trip. To begin, I didn\\'t know much about this game or what to expect. I quickly learned it is a Metroid-vania which typically rewards exploration. On my first playthrough, I was able to get the \"True Ending\" without looking at a guide, which is always a good sign. The game was difficult for me in the beginning, however once I had gotten a handle on the controls/appropriately dodging, the game does become quite enjoyable.\\n\\nOverall, I did like the game eventually, with a few caveats:\\n\\nCons:\\n- The early game will punish you for recklessly moving forward; I\\'m not certain if this was intentional, but often times your HP only allows for 3 hits before dying. While this does force you to get a better handle of the controls, I have to admit I rage quit a couple times (though I did keep coming back)\\n- With some boss fights, there is not always a save point prior to the boss room; this can make some boss fights frustrating\\n- The map is a bit annoying - it would have been helpful if the different areas were color coded\\n\\nPros:\\n- The game offered a decent challenge once the game mechanics were learned\\n- Interesting areas to explore\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- While there are new sprites for enemies in new areas, there are a number of enemy types which are pretty much the same. Once you\\'ve gotten a handle on these basic enemy types, the game becomes a lot easier.\\n\\nMy first playthrough took me just under 8 hours to complete with most of the secrets found. I love this game art style? great game, it is very entertaining, good bosses and fluid gameplay, 8/10 Bought it as tribute to halfcoordinated\\'s speedrun of the same game. No regrets. Game good. deceptively adorable, tight platforming, good bosses, good metroidvania design, amazing soundtrack\\nJUST PURE BLISS.\\n9/10. It\\'s a good game, but one that gets massively overrated in reviews. If you aren\\'t a fan of metroidvania, the art style, or the gameplay upon first view then there probably isn\\'t much in the game that\\'s going to wow you later on contrary to what any fans might have to say.\\n\\nFor the casual gamer I would not recommend this game unless it\\'s already in one of the genres you enjoy. Again, super overrated. It\\'s one of those games with a cult following where every poor design is celebrated rather than pointed out as a legitimate flaw so that\\'s why the reviews are even as high as they are. C A T Horrible game design. I respawned a million times at the first save point (within the tutorial part) and had to play the last half of the tutorial over and over again just because I died again and again as soon as enemys came who actually did something. When you design your next game, try to think of beginners who need to figure out how to fight so just put a damn respawn point right in front of the first real enemys.\\nSpeaking of figuring out the controls: I took so long to figure them out because I played with the keyboard, which had been an excruciating experience. You cant change the controls and to me jumping on a, attacking on s, sniping with d and dodging with q is the weirdest thing ever. Just make the controls editable.\\nAlso the tutorial shows basically nothing. You get introduced to some blocking guy who only blocks from one side. So you just dodge onto the other side and slam him from behind, simple and easy. But when you get to the actual enemys who, as I mentioned, \"do something\" they all of a sudden change direction when you try to do that and block the other side. And then they randomly throw out knifes at you too. Thanks for introducing me to an uterly useless version of this before.  So I just have to kill 10 useless things over and over to find out that they actually do way more and are way harder to kill.\\nI dont care dieing, if I wouldnt had to do utterly useless things over and over. It made me rage quit in the end. This game has really set me in a somber mood, one that I most typically and excruciatingly dislike. But, in this case, it was a good thing, no, a GREAT experience. The tone of the game lets you know that not everything is going to be hugs and kisses, even though the cute, pixelated, chibi-like appearances of almost all of the characters says otherwise (Koha is so cute). \\n \\nThe music was phenomenal. All soundtracks had a melancholic tone to them, some less than others. One particular soundtrack, triggered when entering the stage known as the [spoiler]Subterranean Grave[/spoiler], completely creeps me out, and I love it! \\n \\nI\\'m a fan of the pixelated art-style; it will always have a special place in my heart. I would definitely play through it again if there were some incentive for me, [spoiler] but I\\'m NOT a fan of having to replay through a game to get different endings[/spoiler]. \\n \\nFor a $10 game, $12 for the soundtrack bundle (I got the soundtrack bundle on sale for $5.19), the content is justified. I finished the game within 3 days, but I did enjoy the little bit that I played, and there was still quite a bit I had left to discover. \\n \\nI\\'m not much of an expert to speak of anything else with expertise, so... \\n \\nTL;DR Version: \\nGood game. Would recommend. Misterious, challenging and beautiful, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is an open-ended 2D action scroller with an absolutely amazing visual department with fluid and detailed animations on a pixelated, but beautiful art style. Its single map contains a maze to explore with different environments that hide different visuals and enemies, hiding upgrades, items, easter eggs and even new environments that will encourage the player to explore. Its designed to be replayed, with a New Game+ mode, and additional difficulties that will prove to be quite the challenge.\\n\\n[h1]Its affordable price tag makes it a no-brainer for fans of metroidvania 2D side-scrollers, and it\\'s also recommended to anyone looking for a challenging game.[/h1]\\n\\nNow onto the details:\\n\\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\\nYou\\'re thrown into the shoes of Kaho, a priestess of the Lun village, which has fallen victim of a curse that has extended itself throughout the land, and it\\'s your duty to find a remedy.\\n\\nThroughout the story you\\'ll discover more about the world around you, and will meet unique characters, be it allies or foes.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\\nTo be honest, one of the things that made me try out this game was seeing it on Youtube and being stunned by the animation quality and art. It\\'s brimming with personality. Unique and expressive characters and beautiful backgrounds make for a stimulating experience, with each area containing different environments and enemy types, each with their own theme.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nGameplay reminded me of [i]Dust: An Elysian Tail[/i], and breaks down in three main categories:\\n[list]\\n[*] [b]Exploration[/b]\\nThe game is set on an open-ended environment, which means that you\\'ll be trapped in a single level where you can go back and forth to any direction you want, and revisit places at any time.\\n\\nThis kind of gameplay has it\\'s pros, and cons:\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Allows the player to pace the gameplay and explore the level to their heart\\'s content without having to worry whether they\\'ll miss something out.\\n[*] The environment is refined and there are many multi-purposed areas. This means that some passageways are initially unreachable by the player, which with the later found upgrades, can be explored, bringing life again to what seemed [i]just another cleared area[/i]. With the addition of fast-travel on the latter half of the game just makes exploration more entertaining.\\n[/list]\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Requires backtracking. One of the bad things about these kind of games is that, until you start getting oriented, and/or receive fast-travel, you might find yourself mindlessly walking around the same areas over and over again, which can get a bit repetitive, more so in the first half of the game.\\n[/list]\\n[*] [b]Combat[/b]\\nCombat is composed of two components: Melee, and ranged attacks.\\n\\nMelee has a simple 4 combo mechanic that can be repeatedly used with no cooldown, it\\'s simple yet satisfactory to use, and very effective.\\n\\nRanged attacks are done with a bow and an [i]infinite[/i] amount of arrows, so you don\\'t need to worry about ammo since you\\'ll be using it, [b]a lot[/b]. The bow is the most complex of the two, allowing for charged attacks that, with upgrades, can charge to different levels, attacking in different ways. Other upgrades include rate-of-fire, charge speed and damage.\\n\\nHowever, our protagonist can also [b]dodge[/b] by rolling. It\\'s a really effective and useful mechanic, nullifying any damage done to Kaho when on a roll.\\n\\nThe only frustrating aspect is [b]contact damage[/b] which makes some boss fights frustrating as you\\'ll find yourself taking damage before learning that some characters will roll and move like the player, only that they deal damage by merely [b]touching[/b]. Obviously this is based on preference, as the game will give you the tools to overcome this, and you\\'ll have to approach combat in a different way.\\n\\n[*] [b]Items[/b]\\nThere\\'s a simple inventory system, with slots for consumable items, and passive items. They are sold by different merchants with the in-game currency obtained by either secrets or killing enemies.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]Well, off to check out the rest of the series.[/h1] Great game, amazing atmosphere! An interesting platformer with a cute artstyle but is just too difficult to be enjoyed. A short and sweet metroidvania with gorgeous pixel art, fun and challenging bosses, and the perfect amount of depth for its length. It completely okay to play without having played previous Momodora games. The only downside is that a fair amount of content (in the form of items) is locked behind beating each boss without taking a hit. The game is replayable with a New Game+ that includes new enemy placements and a harder difficulty level for the masochistic among us, but I didn\\'t play either. I would\\'ve liked another way to acquire those items, or at least less powerful versions of each. \\n\\nWould recommend to fans of metroidvanias, or those who are looking to try out the genre. This is a very solid Metroid-vania. While the game is short (I finished it in 4 hours), there was never a dull moment. I was constantly going to a new level within 20-30 minutes, which also meant that I was facing a boss within 20-30 minutes. All the levels and bosses are unique and different from each other, which made for a fairly fun experience.\\n\\nIn this game, you play as a priestess who attacks with a maple leaf…… just roll with it. She also has a normal weapon, a bow, which she uses for ranged attacks. So you have a melee attack and a ranged attack. The ranged attack has the benefit of range (duh) but the drawback is that it does less damage. While the melee attack has the drawback of needing you to get close to your enemies, and therefore putting you at risk of taking damage, the benefit is that it does more damage AND it\\'s guaranteed to stun most enemies on hit (apart from bosses). Because both attacks have very real benefits and drawbacks, you\\'re going to want to switch between them as the situation changes, which keeps combat interesting.\\n\\nEnemies themselves are pretty fun to fight. Full disclosure, if you were to face any enemy 1 on 1, you would probably destroy them. However, what keeps enemies interesting is the COMBINATION of different enemies at once. The levels are designed in such a way that you can\\'t just run through spamming the attack button. You have to wait a little bit, think about the best way to approach the enemies and how they\\'ll react to seeing you, and approach them with a mini-strategy in mind. That doesn\\'t mean the game is slow. It\\'s actually pretty fast-paced, and in fact the correct strategy is often to be on the offensive and attack the enemy before they have time to attack you. It\\'s just that 1 wrong move can lead you to taking a hit (for example, if an enemy takes 3 hits to die but you press the attack button 4 times, the level is designed in a way to punish you for it). So yea, the level design is top-notch.\\n\\nIn regards to bosses, they all look and act very differently from each other (e.g. you\\'re not just fighting a lot of big dudes in armor like in Dark Souls 2). They also require some level of mastering before you\\'ll be able to overcome them. This is because each boss has very specific timing on when you\\'re supposed to dodge the attack. You can\\'t just spam dodge as soon as you see the attack and expect to not take damage. You have to learn the proper timing through trial and error. Furthermore, each boss will drop an item if you can kill them without taking damage. This adds a whole new level of challenge to bosses, and it\\'s something I found a lot of enjoyment in.\\n\\nThe progression in the game is the game\\'s weakest point. You don\\'t get any new weapons, so you always have only 2 very specific attacks. You also don\\'t get any new movement abilities (you get a mid-air dodge, but that\\'s for combat and is never used for platforming. You also are eventually able to turn into a cat, but that\\'s just to fit into small spaces). There\\'s no levelling. In regards to loot, you only have 3 active item slots and 2 passive item slots. 1 active item slot is used for healing (i.e. estus flask), so you really only have 2 active item slots and 2 passive item slots. The passive items you can get are pretty boring and are just damage increases, money drop increases, etc… (you\\'re basically going to use 2 loadouts. 1 loadout increases money collection and reveals secrets. Another loadout increases damage). While there are a lot of active items that are spells, they\\'re effectively useless because all spells require a charge time. That\\'s too slow for bosses and it\\'s faster to kill normal enemies with melee. So yea….. You\\'re not going to progress much from the time you start playing. What you\\'re doing in the beginning of the game is preeeeeeeeeeetty much what you\\'re going to be doing at the end of the game.\\n\\nApart from the progression, there are 2 other weaknesses that stop this game from being anything better than \"good\".\\n\\t• Damage buffs too strong: With the active and passive items, you can get a lot of damage increases that make fighting bosses too easy (active item that gives 100% more damage + passive item that gives 100% more damage at low health + passive item that gives fire damage to attacks = 200%+ damage). This meant that most bosses took like 30 seconds - 1 minute to beat.\\n\\t• Not too difficult/mechanically complex: Enemies eventually become a non-issue because they all die in like 3-5 hits and by the end you have plenty of healing to tank hits until you reach the next save point. Even bosses aren\\'t all that difficult since most of them only have like 3-4 attacks, and almost every attack is simply a matter of timing your dodge-roll properly. Not even jumping is required to dodge any boss attack. It would\\'ve been more interesting if your character had more defensive options to choose from (e.g. blocking) or if more enemy attacks required you to move in certain ways to dodge them. \\n\\nThere\\'s a vague story thrown in. A queen in a kingdom is spreading a curse across the land, and you were sent to stop her. Along the way, you see a lot of NPC\\'s who\\'ve lost hope. It\\'s a fairly typical \"slay the villain\" kind of story. None of the characters are developed or anything (most characters only say 3 things in the entire game) and there\\'s no explanation of WHY anything is happening, so there\\'s nothing really to get attached to.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good Metroid-vania game. However, at the end of the day I can\\'t say it\\'s any better than \"good\" because it\\'s over too quickly and it\\'s honestly not all that hard. Still, I had a fun time playing this game while it lasted. This is a masterpiece.\\nIf you\\'re reading my reviews and saying \"hey, that guy says that everything that he plays is a masterpiece\", know that I agree with you.\\nBut really, I\\'m not kidding now. Do me a favor and go play this game, it\\'s one of my favorite games of all time. Good graphics, poor soundtrack, poor gameplay. There are 600 platformers more enjoyable to play than this This is a kind of weird take on metroidvania and I dont really like it (Tried to play it a couple of times, never really got it.)\\nNot sure what is off about it - technically it\\'s solid and have all the required components - graphic is cute, there are monsters, challenge and checkpoints. But all those pieces will never assemble into a whole picture.\\n\\nFor example monsters respawn every time you enter the screen (like in nes games) but there is no proper platforming, like in, say, Messenger.\\nThere is money drop from monsters but not much stuff to buy\\nThere is some challenge aspect but it\\'s all off - some monsters can oneshot you, but the next boss you can kill without taking any damage\\nThere are secrets and branches but the backtracking is tedious and time consuming\\n\\nOverall this is a schizophrenic game that tries to be a bit everything but never manages to focus on at least one simple concept. Super fucking good, my first platformer and its awesome!! A masterpiece A fun little Metroidvania. It doesn\\'t really do anything particularly new or innovative, but if you\\'re a fan of the genre and need to kill an evening it\\'s worth checking out. cool i really wanna like this game, the sound and art are really good, but it feels clunky as fuck. you move at a powerwalk\\'s pace, jump about your character\\'s height and double jump half that height, which in some games would be forgivable but it feels wrong for something like a platformer. hell, platforms literally just above your head you can\\'t reach without a trampoline. and your health goes down fast, too. it feels very reliant on dodge rolls, you either dodge everything or take a few hits and die. outside enemies interfering with boss fights also frustrate me to no end, in my 2 hours i\\'ve had many instances where i\\'d go at a boss and some outside projectile will fly in and take the last bit of my health bar because i forgot to kill this one thing. when i get all of my card drops i\\'m uninstalling. 4 HOOUUURRRSSS!?!\\n\\nlol get it.\\n\\nbut nah fun game and i like the witch.\\n Pros\\nIts fun.\\nGameplay is challenging \\nArt is great\\nMusic great (OST worth it on sale)\\n\\nCons\\nStory is a bit meh and sometimes made no sense\\nPlatforming can be really unfair you have to be pixel perfect\\nEndings are both really anticlimactic\\nBosses at times are really easy\\nA lot of back tracking (but you should expect that from a Metroidvania)\\n\\nTL:DR\\nGet the game on sale if you\\'re interested. Its fun but the endings is meh. Overall Good game Amazing game, felt like a mix of Dark Souls and Undertale. This game was really cute! I myself didn\\'t find it very difficult at all, but I was playing on normal mode. Most bosses took one try to learn what they did, and then another try to actually defeat them. The art style is very well done, and the music is wonderful and fitting.  Many areas in the game give off a dark/creepy vibe, without over-using things like blood or corpses like some other games might. \\n\\nI\\'m not very familiar with castlevania/metroidvania type games, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this and would recommend it to any of my friends. loved it 🍁 this game is excellent, and challenging, the pretty scenery combined with the pleasant soundtrack sucks you in, the characters are interesting, can get frustrating if your not so fast and smart with the controls but making it through the journey is overall alot of fun and slapping things with maple leaves makes me do a giggle~ Really good metroidvania with a little bit of souls-like. The 2D graphics have really good animation and they just look great. Fighting enemies and exploring the areas is very enjoyable.\\nI think the amount of \"dark-soulsness\" on it is on point, not exagerated and overly punishing just for the sake of it. Dark Souls as a 2D metroidvania game with an all-female, anime-style, pixel-art cast. umu You can control a cat. Its pretty good, but can be frustrating with how little direction it gives you. I spent nearly 2 hours trying to find an object that I already had not realizing I was able to progress further. But Its still good, not great, but something youd play over a weekend, quickly beat it, then never play it again. Cute little metroidvania. Very short, but very compact. No dull moment.\\n\\n3/5 Great Little platformer with some good challenge to it recommend it if you are a fan of 2D scrollers Great little metrovania game. Just getting a message \"bad ending\" when defeating the final boss is a bit disappointing tho. God I love this cute lil\\' boop.\\n\\n[i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] is apparently the fourth game in the [i]Momodora[/i] series, but since it\\'s also apparently a prequel, I\\'m not going to fret about having never played nor heard of any of the others. At a glance, the story\\'s nothing special - you play a priestess from a small village which has become affected by a spreading wickedbadness, and apparently its source is the massive capital city a couple blocks over. Being the fine upstanding do-gooder you are, you grab your ritual whackin\\' leaf and head off to see the queen and find out what\\'s wrong with her plumbing. Upon arrival, you find that everything is deeply horrible, and must slay a bunch of bosses in various corners of the kingdom to unlock the path to the final boss and kick it in the jibblies. All very fine and nice and straightforward.\\n\\nFortunately for us, the team behind [i]M:RUtM[/i] decided to go with the Soulsborne writing style of Showing a world rather than Telling one. As you explore, you meet survivors of the queen\\'s curse who ramble and prattle on and share some deep life goals, but they do a marvelous job of keeping exposition to a minimum. Instead, you have gorgeously polished 2D environments that explain the state of decay far more clearly than words ever could, and each item you pick up offers a couple sentences of vague plot-snacks that make the world at large just a teensy bit clearer. Couple all that with delightful enemy and boss design that straddles chibi and horror splendidly and you\\'ve won me over before we even get to the gameplay.\\n\\n...And then the gameplay\\'s great! Goodness gracious, you little weasels went and accomplished a whole lot with very little there, didn\\'t you? Your character starts the game with a melee attack combo and a few arrow tricks, and you essentially go the whole game relying on those and some consumables. Rather than throwing a massive arsenal at you which you\\'ll never quite get the hang of, [i]Mr. UM[/i] makes each boss encounter creative and complex enough that you need to work out how to go about dodging everything they throw at you while still inflicting damage of your own. And because Bombservice knows it\\'s my favorite gimmick in the world and loves me very much, they even threw in a mechanic where beating a boss flawlessly rewards you with special, unique pieces of equipment, complete with tasty, tasty plot snippets.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a terribly long game, but that\\'s perfectly fine. What we have here is polished \\'til it shines, and even if some pieces of the game seem baffling, I\\'m willing to accept that that\\'s just the devs having fun. If you enjoy a good Metroidvania, [i]Momodora[/i]\\'s one of the best on the market, offering an immediately lovable world and solid gameplay for filthy casuals and elite pro-gamers alike. Yes It\\'s a bit short. It has a cute art style. Some of the game mechanics are kind of imbalanced. Like for example: I\\'d never use the leaf over the bow at any point in the game. It was okay. Rather short but extremely satisfying metroidvania. Love it! 9.5/10 Having so many instant death mechanics mixed with sparse save rooms means you will be spending a disproportionate amount of time just replaying the same dumb level over and over. Quit wasting my time with bad mechanics. Momodora, more like mommy want more-a I started this game last night cause I saw the sequel, Minoria. Which, after this, I definitely plan to buy. Super short game, I finished it in 3 hours, despite my Steam playtime. And you can probably finish it faster if you know what\\'s going on. \\n\\nIt\\'s not even a con of the game, but my only confusion is the boss with enormous, jiggling titties when nothing in the game followed a similar theme. \\n\\nBut yeah great game buy it on sale great A Dark Souls + Metroidvania mashup.  This one leans more towards the Metroidvania, with the aesthetics and mood of a Dark Souls game.  Think of it as a sort of sister game to Salt and Sanctuary, just leaning in another direction.\\n\\nAll that said, it\\'s great.  It reminds me most of Hollow Knight, although it isn\\'t quite as good as that game.  The art is clear while being interesting. Boobs Momodora II-2 is pretty good 8/10 rdein, you magnificent bastard! \\nAs a devote lover of the series putting all of the references to the older games. Bravo!\\nI decided to sit down and play this game once more because of the upcoming game, and accidentally beat it in one sitting (Just under 5 hours) \\nThe real pity here is that I didn\\'t review this game sooner. \\nThe game is your classic Meroidvania with a bit of \"rdein\" flair where you can despair in a souls-like atmosphere while playing as a cute girl on a mission, who runs into people who need a serious dose of vitamin D, and need to go out and praise the sun for a bit. \\nI also accidentally played almost the whole game as a cat.... I cant be the only one. Twas an awesome touch. Will do it again. Amazing So, Momodora is a pre-quel entry and the 4th installment in the series. This was the very first Momodora experience for me. \\n\\n Despite all of it\\'s flaws, it was quite a good experience. If you ask to me, Momodora is a great option for people to enter the metroidvania(-like) games. It is somewhat short, well adjusted in difficulty, filled with secrets, subtle designed and connected world, also flavored with soulslike experience. It may be hard to catch up with the story & lore. However, people are used to play these kind of games for it\\'s gameplay. So I\\'ll be examining Momodora in gameplay wise. \\n\\n You have some basic controls. Jump, roll (and dash in the air later on), attack. You can attack with either your sword or bow. I think bow is quite overpowered if you would have taken pickups later around the midgame. Still, I think bosses are challenging enough. After all, you will memorize the bosses\\' patterns and the whole map because you will be backtracking a lot. \\n\\n What I most dislike about the game is sadly it\\'s final ending and the boss itself. The final boss was quite easy on normal. Bosses are sweet with their animations and all but as in gameplay wise, I just could not say they are great. Specifically final boss is just too basic. Also the game just punishes you if you have not collected a single particular item. That being said the game only has 2 endings which are Bad Ending and True Ending. I mean there are usually Good&Bad&optional/secret endings. There are no proper ending. If you have collected the item you can get the true ending & achievement. If you have not collected that item you just fail and can\\'t fight with the phase 3 of the final boss. If it wasn\\'t a guide, I would not have been finished the game with true ending. \\n\\n + Pretty good amounts of bosses with variety\\n + Cleverly designed levels \\n + A good place to start playing metroidvania(-like) games\\n + It is short but lives it\\'s price tag\\n + Charming animations & pixel art \\n + Item variety, map filled with secrets \\n + Pretty well designed difficulty except few situations + great checkpoint system that is similar to the bonfires\\n\\n - The final boss is just like another boss with 3 phases. \\n - Bosses are usually subpar in gameplay terms comparing them to games like Rogue Legacy, Dead Cells, Castlevania et cetera.\\n - Endings are bad in narrative terms and doesn\\'t give the feeling of accomplishment \\n - Platforming is kinda irritating at times \\n\\nI give the game a solid 78 out of 100 though. It was enjoyable. Looking forward for a sequal filled with better secrets and bosses, and hopefully more lengthful.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35602119-The-Deus-eX-foX/ My curator page. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a well wrought platformer with snappy controls. Unfortunately, everything else about it is forgettable. It\\'s just another pixely platformer with no solid gimmick to really draw on. \"Is that a shaft to the room below me or is it a pit of spikes? It\\'s too dark to tell.\" \\nThat was the last thing I said before quitting this game.\\n\\nIf you do choose to play the game, here are some handy tips that you may want to know ahead of time.\\n-You cannot swim. The first open water you see is directly after the first named boss fight. Most metroidvanias have some form of underwater mechanic, so I jumped in. Drowned. Had to redo the fight.\\n\\n-Spikes are an instant kill.\\n\\nIn short, it\\'s a great Souls-like, but as a Metroidvania, I find it lacking.  I recommend this game to anyone interested in a side scroll action game with elements inspired from the Dark Souls series, the game is kinda short but nevertheless enjoyable and at reasonable price. Cute little game with great art and soundtrack\\nThe combat is kinda so-so ,and so does the story\\n\\nIt\\'s still a nice trip nevertheless, recommend for someone looking for short cute game. A wonderful game, made with care. The game is very good and the graphics too but sadly this is the last Momodora game there will not be Momodora 5 :( It\\'s fun. A charming little game. A few nitpicks aside, it tries too hard to be like Dark Souls but I didn\\'t care for aaaaaaannny of the characters in the end. At all. Was still very fun though. Loved the challenge. This is a good game. Is it worth 100%-ing? Nah. But it handles well, is disquieting, and has a decent story.\\n\\nIt also has you smacking a goddess of decay [b][i] in the mammary glands [/i][/b] in order to cause damage, and that is just weird. Like, WTF were you thinking weird. Muito bom This game is so good I beat it 3 times in a row before playing something else again. this game was simply amazing, i loved it, i hated it, i wanted more, i wanted to stop, it was just so good, like i hated dying but good lord i had to finish it cause i was so close every time, this game makes you go back for more, simply loved it all, would totally recommend this to anyone Aww man, I absolutely love the 4th Momodora installment.\\n\\nThe artstyle looks extremely good, music is very fitting and gives a good atmosphere. Controls are smooth and react fast.\\nIts a challenging 2D platformer with a lot of secrets to find, a big variety of items, enemies and bosses. Prepare to die a lot.\\nThere is a map, so you dont get lost and always see which paths you didnt complete yet. Thats something I really liked, if I ended up confused.\\nI like to crown it the 2D Dark Souls.\\n\\nBuy it, play it, love it. Its a unique game. long time since i played a game so shitty Only downside is that it\\'s so short.\\n\\nFor fans of:\\nIgavania\\nHollow Knight\\nDark Souls [i]\"Some things don\\'t need words. Sometimes it\\'s enough to just feel. You don\\'t have to label and articulate all that\\'s around you.\"[/i]\\n[b]11/10 Amazing game[/b] Great art,\\nAmazing sound design,\\nGood music,\\nFun combat,\\neasy to pick up and finish in one sitting. Great game A solid Metroidvania with a great aesthetic. Short and sweet. 8/10.\\n\\nThe only real letdown is that [spoiler] the Final boss is pitifully anticlimactic, even with the Good ending. [/spoiler] It reminds me of my grandpa, who was a decent man,devoting to his family. They found him in the garden one morning. Doctor says no one could survive that,it was a one hit death spike. 9.1/10\\nBought the game because an Emo dude played it and the game had a big titied boss.\\nStayed for the challenge. very hard but fun, controls feel great it is a great game BIG Castlevania feel.\\nFuck Yeah Art!\\nDark undetailed story that works well here for atmosphere together with gloomy environments.\\nPretty easy bosses where I died 1 or never at them except BADDY BADDY AT END(use items)\\nMEGA CHARM so MEGA RECOMMEND This game was really short and the combat was bland. The story was terrible and the game was shallow like a kiddy pool in almost all aspects. The music was pretty nice and the graphics were good. 3/10 would not buy.

I never developed the muscle memory for platformers when I was younger so these sorts of games are usually impossible for me to enjoy. Like it\\'s predecessor, this title cares enough to offer easier mode that welcomes players like me. Additionally, it has a nice, haunting atmosphere that balances the general cuteness of the character designs. Lovely pixel graphics and music to boot. Absolutely worth your time and money! yup This is a fantastic introduction to the difficult platformer genre of games. If you find games such as Cuphead or Spelunky too difficult, give this one a go. The art is really charming, the movement and combat feels responsive and crisp, and the gameplay is fun while still presenting enough of a challenge to cater to both hardcore sadists and newcomers alike. I would definitely recommend this game to veterans of the genre and to those who are interested in getting a first taste. This is the best game I\\'ve played since Hollow Knight. Holy shit I will buy every game like this I hope they make another. Boner alert Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a graphically stunning game, with great atmosphere and an eye-catching story. \\n\\nThe only problem I have with it, is that fighting enemies is needlessly unfair. There would be times where 4+ enemies were in the same room and it would be impossible to dodge their attacks because of how small the area was. \"Why not just kill them?\" you might of asked. Well, everytime you attack an enemy, the character steps a bit forward, leaving other enemies to attack you repeatedly. They don\\'t even have to attack you to deal damage, the character just has to bump into them.\\n\\nEven so, dealing damage to your foes feels great, and the combat problem is nowhere to be found in the boss battles.\\n8/10 Absolutely one of the best action/metroidvania/platformer games I\\'ve played in a while. The progress that rdein makes on each subsequent Momodora game is staggering. It\\'s pretty short; it took me like 5 hours to beat, but the experience was worth it. Highly recommended Really Fun and i would recommended this game to anyone Great short Metroidvania, hits the sweet spot on map design where there is plenty to explore, but you aren\\'t constantly looking for the thing you missed. Challenging game play with responsive controls. It\\'s a pretty interesting game. If you like metroidvania games with pixel art style. Momodora is worth a try since it\\'s not very expensive. \\n\\nGetting it on sale is a nice deal. The game is pretty short and took me around 4 hours to beat it and get the True Ending, the maps are nice to explore but the controls are a bit clunky and may take a while to get used to.\\nIt\\'s not like this game is bad, it is quite good and fun but I have to say that nothing really in this game stands out. There aren\\'t many attack options, very few enemy variety, it\\'s very short and the story is kinda average, soundtrack also didn\\'t catch my attention.\\n\\nGet it when it\\'s on sale and if you like Metroidvania games, it\\'s a nice game to have in your library but don\\'t expect too much from this game. If you\\'re looking for something better in all aspects, check out Touhou Luna Nights from the same publisher.\\n\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/851100/Touhou_Luna_Nights/ Try and try again a boss battle to finally beat it, only to get unjustly killed by an offscreen peon on the next screen when trying to get back to the save point. tl;dr If you like dying and jumping on platforms – go for it, it\\'s really worth it\\n\\nWelp, I got much more fun from it than I expected (but it was a forgotten game on my list from some kind of bundle, so I couldn\\'t have much expectations to begin with).\\n\\nThe controls are what you would expect from solid, non-forgiving, yet fair, metroidvania. Every mistake I made was my, and my only. Whacking enemies is pretty fun, though you might quite quickly find that avoiding them is just as effective (except for some cases). Main character feels satisfying to walk, jump, dash and fight, which is important to mention, beacuse if opposite happens in a game, it ruins a whole lotta fun, in my opinion.\\n\\nGraphics are really appealing. I wouldn\\'t necessary say that everything looks stunnig, but it\\'s solid, modern pixelart. Quite nice touch is actually seeing it being only pixelart, and none of that blurs and effects on lighting and shading. Same goes for animation – satisfying to watch (I often found myself just swinging the weapon around to see how the character moves, so kudos to the animators).\\n\\nMusic and sound design is good. There\\'s nothing that stuck with me (even after repeating bosses several times in a row) so I can\\'t say it\\'s too memorable, but it\\'s solind and enjoyable. I\\'m not sure on this one, but I would say that most of the bosses share the same track, which gets boring after some time (and loses a lot of its drama).\\n\\nBosses, are, of course, the main course and boy, are they really thoughtful put together. With a few expections, every fight is unique and memorable, and even though I can\\'t remember all of the characters names, I still remember how to fight them and what moves thes execute in which order. Those are the main difficulty of the game, and the reason you die so often, as expected, but I rarely felt irritated during the process.\\n\\nDifficulty is rather low dare I say. Despite many options in-game and additional challanges suggested by achievements I didn\\'t have much problem with finishing the game on hard difficulty in around 4 hours, and then re-running it again on insane difficulty (you basically die in one hit form 90% of stuff) in half the time. But then again, for somebody new to the genre it might be more challenging.\\n\\nStory and characters are quite basic, devs really wanted to go for this scarce, dark souls-ish item descrition lore, but I didn\\'t get hooked. You probably could create quite interesting universe while reading all descriptions and dialogues, but the main arc of the game would still be quite mundane. I don\\'t wanna get into details, but *great threat*, *4 powerful beings*, *primodial evil*, you know the drill.\\n\\nAnd last, but not least – heavily inspired by some elements from Dark Souls. I mean, usually it\\'s game mechanics or something like that, but this time I found myself giggling while finding exact replica of “Does not open from this side” frm my beloved franchise. Beside that, the general feel of the city was came preety close to Dark Souls 3, and the panels showing names of the locations were almost identical. Maybe at this point I\\'m nitpicking, but I there\\'s only so many options for doing these kinda stuff in different ways, so I can\\'t say I\\'m disappointed or mad. One of my favorite games to play over and over again, its a must for anyone that loves any games like these this game has the right look and vibe for it\\'s genre but its ultimately unfun. great game 10 / 10 Beautiful pixel art and animation, good control, just a bit short.\\n\\nIf you like metroidvania games, give it a go. \\n it\\'s hard, I like it bought it on sale, however I wish I paid full price for it. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a fun metroidvania game with beautiful 2d graphics, the music is a treat to listen to as well, each track making me want to explore the area to completion. The difficulty is pretty fair but still gives a good challenge, with each death feeling like one you got without it feeling cheap. overall I\\'d give this game a 9.5 / 10 it would get a 10 / 10 if it were a little bit longer. Great gameplay, amazing pixel art and a metroidvania. The only (kinda) negative point is the game length, which is short, but for the price asked, is more than worth it. Did buy on sale.\\n\\nThe game is enjoyable to play.\\nThe combat is fast enough, so I don\\'t feel that game cheated somehow.\\nA bit of backtracking had to do but map is not overly big.\\nGraphics are simple enough but everything is distinguish and colour pallet is good and easy on the eye.\\n\\nSo I would recommend this game if you enjoy platformers and metroidvania-ish type of games that is not overly hardcore. Such a beautiful game, and pretty hard. Music, animations, background, desing, combat and dialogues makes this game feel amazing. [spoiler]I personally love the Pardonel Fennel fight, I fell in love with her, but the way to kill her almost instantly is kinda underwhelming.[/spoiler] Great metroidvania with engaging combat and level design. I\\'m not too far ahead but I can already tell this game is full of cahrm and atmosphere, this is the third Momodora game I\\'ve played and this might sound cliche, but it honestly feels what a 2d fromsoft game would be like :v Literally one of the best indie games I\\'ve ever played, if not the best.\\nWhen I first played this game I was a little triggered, but after learning some strategies for bosses and suffering for a long time, \\nI finally got it. \\nWow, this game compensates the player so much when you learn all the combos with your items and movement and \"leafmanship\"? if that\\'s a thing.\\nBut I love this game even if a haven\\'t played it to much on pc, I played it like crazy on my ps4.\\nJUST PLAY IT ALREADY.\\n I love souls-type games for the music, aesthetics, boss fights, character designs, and I.M.O., the  most important, the lore. I think this has that. Could it be better? Yeah. Is it bad? Hell no. Really my only quarrel with it is the lack of world-building, things like why bosses fight you and why they are located where they are. Things like the reasoning and rationale of a character that guides the choices that they make, but hey nothing is perfect. The game is still gorgeous what with it\\'s game design, secrets, and gameplay. Sadly there isn\\'t much for multiple playthroughs other than completing all the endings, and getting all the items and achievements. Still, I\\'d very highly recommend this game. The perfect game for those who\\'s into the metroidvania and bullet-hell genre. Can be categorized in the bullet-hell genre considering that each bosses will have their own unique attack patterns, and that you\\'ll be required to study and analyze them in order to get past them; in one piece. Each soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the location you\\'re in, as well as the bosses. Let\\'s take Pardoner Fennel for an example, you can feel the sorrow and despair her theme has, as how the queen she once entrusted has turned into a bewitched being who now just lusts for power. \\nWhat I found best about this game is that you\\'ll be rewarded an item everytime you best a boss without suffering any damage. I mean, of course the player should be rewarded, after all they\\'ve spent countless hours studying each boss\\'s attack patterns to perform damageless runs. It aight. win10\\ncrashes: no\\nother issues: no \\nliked the game: yes This is a beautiful MetroidVania game with great soundtrack and aesthetic. It is not too long or too challenge but still worth your three to four hours if you looking for a weekend game. I recommend this game for anyone who played Metrovania style games. The gameplay is solid. Great game. Controls are pretty simple but smooth and it is a little challenging at times but not too hard. Recommend for everyone who likes Plattformers and Metroidvania games. A fun and underappreciated 2D platformer with some amounts replayvalue, though mostly for achievementhunting or secret searching, also has some fun bossdesign with a bonus for people who manage to defeat a boss without taking damage, for people who like a challenge. Cute and challenging, all around well worth a play A fun but challangeing game where you hack and slash your foes and deftly dodge them in order to purify the land. If you like a good challange, this game is for you. This game felt fun, challenging, and fresh.  I enjoyed the art style and the platforming was good. The progression felt natural and not too fast or too slow. if anything game was kinda short\\n Such a great game, Honestly this is my 1 favorite game. i go back every couple months and play through it again on insane. It\\'s a wonderful platformer, everything from combat to dashing is perfect. If you\\'re a fan of metroidvanias or platformers in general please play this game, you\\'ll love it. great game, wish more people knew about it its a great metroidvania style game and has a great story Nice platformer with several routes and challenges. Great replayability. Cute little Metroidvania. The story felt a little lacklustre, but the gameplay was smooth enough to make up for it. Visually speaking, the game is very appealing and diverse! Overall, it\\'s worth the money. Its an incredibly detailed game, it has great gameplay , i am looking forward for more games from this developer. Beautiful and cute pixel graphics were what got me to buy it. Found it difficult at first, but managed to power through. i later watched a speedrun and that got me motivated to nab the rest of the achievements and try the harder difficulties.\\nDo wish we could learn more about this world and its inhabitants. I just bought this game and this is amazing, i beated it, hated the true ending, but it did make my soul hurt and made and effectiviely made me feel emotion A cute, little game. A great game with an incredible atmosphere. Great gameplay, interesting story, great music, and beautiful visuals. I love this game. The graphics are cute and the music feels really nice in the background. I played this entire series from 1 & 2 free and 3 on sale. But 4 really took the cake for great boss fights, intricate gameplay and eerie music. I got my brother to play this on hard mode and he enjoyed it. This platformer has an amazing atmosphere and really tight controls. Excellent Metroidvania type game, its pretty short but gold all through Momodora is a beautifully crafted adventure game and one of the best metroidvanias I had the pleasure to experience. \\n\\nThe graphics, although simple, are quite satisfying to look at, specially during the action sequences. \\n\\nThe gameplay is responsive and gives you a variety of tools to play with as you customise your playstyle (I in particular had a blast using a pure damage build that nuked every boss in a few hits from Kaho\\'s magical leaf). It is quite challenging even in normal difficulty, so bewarned.\\n\\nThe story is full of mysteries that will keep you guessing for a good part of the game, although it is a shame that many questions are never truly answered, something that keeps me longing for a sequel.\\n\\nOverall, this is a hidden gem. Worth the price I would say, but this game goes on sale quite often, so you can get it for a bargain.\\nThe only problem I have with the whole experience is that it is a bit too short.\\n\\n9/10 A short and sweet Metroidvania-style combat/platformer. It\\'s pretty standard as far as the genre goes, which is not a bad thing (it\\'s kind of like comfort food). The controls feel good and the difficulty is about average (it\\'s not very difficult except maybe a couple of bosses). If you are a fan of this style of platformer, this is worth the price for a few hours of entertainment, especially if on sale. Short and sweet, with a cool enviorment and  10/10 Cuteness (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)و\\n\\n Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is truly a masterpiece. For me, this is hands down the best metroidvania I have ever played. If you\\'re a fan of the genre or the art style, then please do not pass up this game. 10/10 I love this game. It manages it to make Dark Souls 2d. For 5$ I would recomend it to everyone. if you like action platformers this one is for you. The series began as a small project inspired by cave story and other such games and you can play the first 2 games for free if you want to get a taste of what this game is like. While this is the fourth game in the series but you don\\'t need to play any of the other games beforehand to know whats going on. This game has improved on the combat mechanics of the previous games and in some ways I would even call it a metroidvania with lots of areas to explore, well designed boss fights, and tons of power ups to collect. The gameplay and art is amazing! Highly recommend it! this game is one of the best platformers iv\\'e ever played. its challanging the soundtrack is nice and the art is amazing.its not to hard but not to easy. it is just amazing. Very good game that not many people know about.\\nIt\\'s a metroidvania, with good music and bosses.\\nPros:\\n*Boss battles resolve around dodging attacks and optimizing your damage.\\n*You can use a wide selection of items to enchance your damage or survival (or money adquisition).\\n\\nCons:\\n*The first time you die will give you a heart attack (don\\'t play with high volume like me).\\n*Some items aren\\'t interesting.\\n*It\\'s sad...\\n\\n This is without a doubt one of the best surprises on Steam that I have found. Wonderful music, interesting world, lovely art, and the gameplay is super tight. Give this game a chance, you won\\'t regret it. This is a nice little metroidvania with good music and an excellent pixel-art aesthetic. Has some challenging boss fights. Not super long, but felt just right for it\\'s story. PROS\\n- Fun gameplay; it\\'s fun to roam around, trying out different paths.\\n- Combat is satisfying.\\n- Soundtrack is good and nice to listen to without being too intrusive.\\n\\nCONS\\n- Difficult, but not in the good way. \\nUsing Hollow Knight for comparison, the truly difficult enemies and bosses in that game have unorthodox attack patterns, attack you from a place that is difficult to reach, or require precise timing in dodging and counterattacking.\\nThe difficulty in the enemies of this game is \"This enemy does ungodly amounts of damage for no reason. Eat a dick.\"\\nSeriously. The beginning enemies can chew off half of your health bar in one hit. A lot of enemies have really bland attack patterns (wait, jump. wait, jump.) and can be (kind of) easily avoided, like those ghost-wolves in the second area. They still do really high amounts of damage for what is supposed to be a run-of-the-mill \"haha im in your way\" enemy, but fine, this game is made to be difficult.\\nBut the goddamn witches snip off half your health bar in one hit. Their attacks also go through walls, are targeted (meaning they aim to where your character was/is), and are ranged. There\\'s some areas in the beginning of the game where you can\\'t see the witch on screen, but you can hear it and see it attacking you.\\n- The backgrounds of the game, while pretty, make it really hard to see translucent enemies spawning out of nowhere. Speaking of:\\n- Enemies spawn out of nowhere. No warning, no sound, no special graphic, nothing. Just a spawning animation. And it doesn\\'t help that a lot of them are transparent, so they\\'re even harder to see against backgrounds depending on their color.\\n\\n\\nI want to like this game. It\\'s charming, the character designs are cute/cool, the combat is satisfying as hell. \\nBut this isn\\'t how you make a game difficult; this is how you make a game unfair.\\nIf you like getting disintegrated by beginning-game level enemies, I can recommend this 100%.\\nIf you\\'d rather not, I can\\'t say this game\\'s for you.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: I never understood the concept of having enemies having hitboxes aside from their attacks. Why does the body of a regular human wearing a white dress hurt me? If it\\'s a knight with spiky armor, sure. But just some regular old Steve Johnson? I don\\'t understand. All of the game is super awesome. Ultra recommended. Try it out if you like the metroidvania genre in general. Gameplay is pretty simple, you can attack, roll, jump etc and you gain other abilities throughout like any other metroidvania. Even on the hardest difficulty the game really isnt hard due to a large amount of checkpoints and the fact the game is fairly short. The bow feels like it almost should have been the main weapon in this game because it is so much more useful than melee, especially if you get a handful of bow specific damage items.\\n\\nThe art in particular is quite nice with a couple of very well done scenes that stand out even from the rest of the game.\\n\\nThe game is unfortunately very short. I like this game. For people familiar with the mechanics of the Souls games it will be fairly easy to pick up and beat, and worth mastering. If you are also familiar with Metroidvania games there will be a lot of aspects to appreciate. I think overall, the game is well made, it\\'s a brief and enjoyable experience that knows very well where it\\'s strenghts lies. \\n\\nBut it may be too dependant on the mix of genres to draw the player in, and while it\\'s enough, it does not challengue any new boundries, it just proves that the mix goes well, without adding too much of it\\'s own elements, to a mixture some may have been able to guess would work. Its a good This is a neat little metroidvania game, not too long that takes around 4 hours to beat on your first playthrough. The game mechanics are solid and it makes for a very nice speedrun experience that isn\\'t too hard to learn. cool game I liked it. :^) Amazing artstyle and fun gameplay Honestly a very good Metroidvania. Controls are tight, combat is fluid, and the music is awesome! Any fan of Metroidvanias should definitely check this game out. Probably the most successful balance between Æsthetics, fluid game play, choice of play style (there are several valid builds), rich yet minimalist story line and music. This game is a masterpiece and anyone who enjoys platformers will likely love this game. I have purchased this game several times over for my friends and it is worth every penny! cute Cute and short game Very gud A sweet and short game. There isn\\'t too much backtracking, but the game let\\'s you pick the path you want in a decently connected map. The controls felt really good. The game isn\\'t too challenging if you pay attention to the enemies, but it still felt rewarding completing it. Good atmosphere, a bit desolate in a nice \"kawaii\" pixel art. The characters and enemies are interesting and have a good design. \\n\\nIn gameplay the movement is a little heavy and all the blows have a lot of impact, which requires some caution of the player and provides a good challenge and some adaptation to the mechanics and rhythm of the game. \\n\\nThe main story is fairly objective and the plot goes straight to the point, it has very little backtracking. \\n\\nGood game, I was satisfied with the experience, but after finishing I did not feel much objective to replay. I love the art style and how challenging the stage is, Frikin Darksoul Never thought i\\'d enjoy a platformer this time of year This game is absolutely amazing! Everything from the art style, smooth animations, great soundtrack, and fun bosses, this game has easily become one of if not the best metriodvania I have ever played. If you have had your eye on this game definitely purchase it, you will not regret it. Wonderful. . Good stuff, but story could\\'ve been more fleshed out. A beautiful and well crafted metroidvania This is one of the best indie games I\\'ve ever played. The combat is simple, but still very engaging because of stellar level design. You have to platform your way around enemies and their projectiles to kill them, which makes every single room a unique combat experience. And the exploration is amazing. There are so many little secrets that make exploring every nook and cranny of the map rewarding and beneficial to player progression.  This is one of a very small handful of games I\\'ve gotten every achievement/ trophy in because I love it that much. \\n\\nA few negatives. The movement can feel a bit slow, especially after playing a game where the player speed is sanic fast. And the jumping is a bit weak. Siting here though I can\\'t think of anything else wrong with the game. Basically this game is a masterpiece. A must buy for metroidvania fans, indie fans, or anyone who can spare a few dollars. Fun little metroidvania nope this game makes me feel like the average link player online This is the 4th game in the MOMODORA series, its a prequel, I do not know the lore, I do not know why I am here, I do know I must kill this evil queen.\\n \\n[b]Pro\\'s[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Great pixel style\\n[*]Controls are super tight\\n[*]Your Holy Leave Cuts through Bruhs\\n[*]Beautiful soundtrack\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Con\\'s[/b]\\n¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\\n \\n\\nThe music is just..... lovely.\\nThe game mechanics are cool, and this entire game is worth it. Got to slap a witches tiddies. 10/10\\n\\nA pretty nice little metroidvania title. It\\'s cheap, it\\'ll scratch an itch. have a go the game is pretty good, but it\\'s unplayable without a controller. So damn well done, feels a lot soul-like elements Very good game, beautiful graphics and fair difficulty.\\nLevel design is just unfair sometimes. Not often, but frequentely enough to know that it has been made on purpose.\\nI understand that the game takes place in the \"hard game\" spectrum, but it doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s ok to put unpredictible death traps. Game was quite enjoyable but was also quite short.  Took me just over 5h on my first play through on hard.  I would definitely recommend it though.  The controls are tight, the music is great, and the level design and monster placement are well done. This is one of my favorite games. A \"simple\" metroidvania, fun, re-playable, cute and a little challenging even in normal(if you aren\\'t a hardcore gamer, like me).\\nThis is one of  my inspirations to become a game dev n.n\\nThanks for made it <3\\nEven if my steam record says 18 min, I know I\\'ve spent more than 6 hours playing and re-playing it i love everything about this game. the ost is beautiful, the sprites and environments are beautiful. It\\'s challenging enough that bosses take effort and time to beat, but not so difficult that it makes me wanna give up. it\\'s so, so worth it. please play it. Cute little Metroidvania game.\\nAround 6 hours for a first playthrough, but you got some good achievements and new routes to try out on new runs!\\nSome frustrating RNG on bosses from time to time, but I need to [i]git gud[/i] even more I guess.\\nArt, animations and musics are gorgeous.\\nA very good and fun experience in the end.\\n\\nAnd uhh.. there are CATS! A deceptively easy and thoroughly satisfying game with extremely well considered mechanical and situational design.\\nThe game does a fantastic job of making you feel like it\\'s \"hard\" and \"unfair\" while also providing every tool needed to thoroughly overcome every obstacle on any difficulty without ever a question as to if you might somehow fail with a bit of practice and some thoughtful consideration.\\n\\nShort and sweet, should also be a very approachable game as baby\\'s first speedrun. Even a casual player can make short work of the harder difficulties in under 4 hours on a second or third playthrough, <2 being very easy with a bit more experience. Open ended and exploratory, but also an easy single sitting game, and anyone determined can probably bring the time under one hour. Leafslapping is great. A really good charming metroidvania with a dark atmosphere and anime visuals. Combat and movement is solid, pixel art is great, lore leaves a lot to imagination but is good for what it is, and there are enough secrets/powerups to keep things interesting. Some of the other negative reviews criticize the gameplay but if you\\'ve played other metroidvanias there shouldn\\'t be anything shocking. As long as you pay attention you\\'ll be able to notice the insta-kill spikes and other traps. Overall really enjoyed it, playthrough was around 4 hours, 100% might take another two hours or so. Short and sweet. Momodora is a Metroidvania on the Castlevania end of the spectrum. No RPG elements, but the game is combat-focused with plenty of excellent boss fights. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that Normal mode is Hard mode. I spent half an hour cursing at this game before switching to Easy mode, which is so easy, it should be called You\\'re-A-Baby mode. Something between the two would have been better. It took me two and a half hours on easy mode to finish this game. And even still, I am very tempted to continue with the New Game Plus.\\n\\nI hope that we get to see another installment of Momodora! Pretty amazing. This is one of those games that randomly pop into your head sometimes and make you think \"man, that was a really good game\". Awesome animations and gameplay, would recommend to anyone looking for a metroidvania game. TL;DR I\\'m not sure this game was play tested. It\\'s very pretty, but very annoying to play.\\n\\nThis game is almost good. This game has so many things going for it in the looks, sound, and world building departments; but this game is lacking everywhere else. The controls are so stiff, but I did get used to them, and there were so many BS deaths that I just couldn\\'t avoid. The areas were interesting to explore, but I accidentally stumbled into the end of the game because nothing told me that I happened upon the final boss. I accidentally got the bad end (which I didn\\'t know was a thing in this game), but I still had so much left to do. The starting area was pretty intuitive when introducing mechanics, but then there are some parts of the game where it doesn\\'t tell you enough or where it straight up contradicts it\\'s self! For example: the game teaches you that water kills by letting you jump off a bridge, but then there\\'s a whole under water area I couldn\\'t find because I thought the entrance would kill me. I\\'m also pretty sure the game broke on me too. There\\'s an npc that gives you money for bugs, and at some point they just stopped accepting the bugs I was collecting... I would talk to them and they\\'d say \"bring me more bugs and I\\'ll reward you,\" but they wouldn\\'t take the bugs or reward me. Big disappointment. The crappy controls and menus reminds me of the 90\\'s, not to mention the unmappable keys. Enemies do a ton of damage and you can\\'t even air dodge, trying to explore doesn\\'t yield much and every time you die you have to start from a waypoint from a mile away while every enemy twoshot you. Sometimes attacks would go through enemies but your animation lock will make get you in contact and take dmg which is always about 50% of your total health. It\\'s really stupid and annoying.\\n\\nOverall, The pixel graphics would be okay but from controls to mechanics and gameplay just feels annoying and clunky. I\\'ve played dozens of similar type games but this I\\'ll just give up because I don\\'t have fun with it at all. The world-building does a lot with very few details, and the dungeons are interesting.The art is also excellent (the giant jiggly-boobed bosses you see in all the promo pics for some reason are not a major feature of the game, they only show up 2 or 3 times). There are some fun grace notes among the gothic atmosphere, like all the cats hanging out with the abbess.\\n\\nI found it really difficult but luckily the difficulty can be adjusted and the Easy setting was perfect for me. :)\\n\\nPlus, it runs beautifully on a very mediocre laptop, which I really appreciate! tig ol\\' bitties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nme likey :) This is a bad metroidvania. So many positive reviews only for the good graphics is a terrify. Yes, it\\'s beautiful, but there is just a lot of problems with game design. People had different claims about: duration of the game, useless power-up\\'s, annoying enemies, level design, pixel jumps and some bugs on bosses (attacks animations, attacks of enemies from behind the locked screen), but the main problem is in the working with the genre.\\n\\nThis metroidvania punishes you for research. You must learn the exact paths from the proposed scheme: 3-5 rooms, save point, 3-5 rooms, etc. Any distraction from this route is punished with the instant death holes and enemies spam attacks. You passed two and a half locations, discover some secrets, buying and changing equipment, killing enemies for the gold, and then accidentally died, because there is nowhere to fill your health? Be kind to go through all of this again! It\\'s just like to read the same paragraph over and over. This is an incredibly dull affair. Meh... This game is underwhelming to me. I got past the first area on normal, then the second got impossible, so I started over on easy. It\\'s really annoying how a game can be so bland as well as unforgiving. There is enough charm to keep me going, but this game definitely won\\'t make my A-list. My recommendation is to get it on sale and play it on easy.\\n\\nUPDATE: Gave up. The reward just wasn\\'t worth the challenge, and it wasn\\'t fun. It\\'s been a long time since I feel this kind of nostalgic love to a videogame, all I can say is; thank you to the developers for letting me enjoy this lovely game This game is excellent. I play this game just for the death animation sometimes its pretty funny :D \\u200bBeautifully \\u200bcrafted Metroidvania masterpiece. \\u200b Love everything about this game, story, animation, snappy combat, art... The game is short (finished it in about 8 hours) but that felt right as well. Absolutely recommended! Short but pretty good gameplay and with everything you\\'d expect from a metroidvania: backtracking, collectables, amazing boss fights, branching paths, etc. A gem in the metroidvania genre. Game is incredible from start to end. Graphics are insanely well done. Combat is smooth. Highly recommend for fans of Metroidvania games. Not long but fun. is good :)\\n Short and Sweet Simple, but fun combat. Neat lore and environments and a lot of secrets and exploring to do. The animation is really nice as well. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to scratch that Metroidvania itch. Definitely lighter on story and heavier on gameplay, but I found the plot behind the game to be pretty intriguing, especially with the creepy setting. I\\'d heard a lot about how difficult it is, but I think the difficulty is pretty reasonable - for the most part it\\'s all approachable. You might have to retry some bosses or areas, and some sections include instakill spots where you have to be really careful about your jumping timing or placement, but it feels [i]challenging[/i], not impossible. It\\'s also challenging enough even in the easier spots to keep your attention. The art is great - nostalgic without looking old or low-quality - and the music is really incredible to listen to. Definitely worth a try. A beautiful looking platformer with great music.  It can be a bit hard at times, but it isn\\'t too bad on normal and it stems from being fair in it\\'s difficulty, not cheap.  It\\'s quite a short game, but offers some replayability with NG+ if you\\'re into testing yourself on the harder difficulties. (incl. the insane one which is essentially one hit deaths)  You\\'ll finish your first playthrough within a few hours, but still a nice treat if you can snag it on sale for $5 (or less). it\\'s real good This game has a lot in common to a game that I already play called Shantae Half Genie Hero. Though instead of the music and environment being all bouncy and everything is always moving here in this game it is subtle. It has that depressing apocalyptic feel to it and I dig it! The similarities between the two are the cute characters, a sexy villain, the overall movements of the games and they but give me a smile. I dig this game. This was an awesome game. Shorter than most games I\\'ve played in the past (6 - 8 hours), but I actually found that to be kind of refreshing. Pretty fun game that I fully recommend. To list off some of its stand out features\\n-Great pixel art and art direction, locations always look either lived in or quite scenic;\\n-Great soundtrack with a good variety of themes;\\n-Good replay value and different paths you can take to complete the game;\\n-mastering the combat and movement feels great on Insane difficult;\\n-bosses are fun and diverse in play styles;\\nMy play time reflects one run on Hard, one run on Insane, one Pacifist No Death run on Easy and some extra time dedicated to getting all the content in game. \\n Very Good I buyed this game without any expectation, just in an impulse of consumism. But all the expectation what i didnt have was completely attendeds! The art is amazing, the soundtrack is beatiful (i getted stucked in Fezzel for a 30 minuts, i guess, and now her song is my favorite, and a special thx to Bombservise for fck my feels, i really didnt expectate for that, and how im pretty slow understanding the things, just talking with Paramol again i understanted, who was THAT new npc in monastery, and after cry for 5 minuts, i taked my achieviment and cotinued my game), but is really short!\\n\\nIf u just rush the game, doesnt care with the achievs too much, the hided things and doesnt dieying as fck, like me, u can end the game in one day, but for the other achievs (how i still have to do xD), i think its pretty replayable(that word exist?)\\n\\njust one thing letted me a little unconfurtable: The control... If u have a controler USB, u can just ignore this and will play, but if are u thinking in play on keyboard... i telling u, that is  probably the worst decision that u can make, i know, i know, didnt have much buttons what are confortables to use for a long time in keyboard, but... A,S,D and i cant remember all then because i changed in the first seconds. that wasnt a good decision, in my sight\\n\\nMomodora can be resumed in a short, but really good game, if u want some fast experience, doesnt want to pay too much, a pretty art and soundtrack. thats for u :) You must understand that the initial toughness of this game is balanced later on. It\\'s off putting at first (when I played it, it seemed so unforgiving that I left it alone for a while) but once I came back with a fresh attitude I realized the strategy behind it. Never go too far without saving and always play defensively … it is better to take your time with a boss and come out unscathed than button smash your health bar into oblivion. Also take breaks! If you get cocky and fly through tough enemies only to die to a common one, it can get irritating. I think the balance is just right; you must believe in the beginning, look at that beautiful pixelated art and press forward. There’re some charms you get later that turn the game from an ordeal into a wonderful experience, with different enemies, environments, music and bosses. \\nI like the story as well; the country girl who comes into the city to address a curse that reached her homeland seemed like a novel idea. Everyone laughing at her for doing so seemed so as well. I also found her extremely cute. The way she didn’t get a message box and yet still communicated with other characters only added to the charm. This is a dungeon-crawler I massively enjoyed and would recommend to anyone who liked games such as Hollow Knight, Dead Cells or Ori and the Blind Forest; difficult but rewarding. Great pixel art, fun and challenging battles (already on normal mode) and surprising dark setting. But i love it! \\nStory basically not really there but its enough to keep you interested. \\nIts also a pretty short game which is not bad i think, because i was motivated to replay it on different difficulty and searching for hidden content.\\nIf u like 2D Castlevania-ish games go for it. Probably the best 10 bucks I\\'ve ever spent on Steam. A short game, but what a good one. One of these games that take a special place in my heart. Great little metroidvania. I found it a little frustrating at first, but once I got used to the controls I played straight through to the end. Lovely and rather sweet. Nice characters and challenge with additional rewards for taking no damage from bosses. Really really nice graphics and style and lovely fluid combat even with the 2D restriction. Pros:\\ngood controls\\nlooks great\\ndecent soundtrack\\ngood atmosphere\\n\\ncons:\\nbad level design\\nbad boss fights\\nbad at teaching the player\\narbitrary multiple endings\\nbad difficulty pacing\\nbad upgrades\\n\\nnow to justify myself: ((MAJOR SPOILERS FOR BOSSFIGHTS AND LEVEL DESIGN))\\nThe level design is good on most accounts except for a lot of places where jumps are 1 or 2 pixels higher than you can jump, tricking players into thinking they can make it up there when they cannot. There are also places where enemies that are designed to blend into the background (paintings, statues) are introduced by placing them on the other side of an instant death pit, causing you to slam your face into them and die. There are also way too many instant-death spikes and tricky jumps that just feel like cheap deaths.\\n\\nThe bosses are good looking, but their fight design is pretty awful. The first boss has several attacks with vague sprites (as in, they are mostly transparent and circular with minimal indication) and I found myself turning down the graphics options to lower the detrimental graphical effects such as lighting that hides indicators and particles that clutter the screen. Along with this, many bosses have attacks that either cover most of the screen (the witch that you fight twice has an attack that is both vague and covers a lot of the screen) or chase you down. In particular, one of the humanoid bosses has an attack in their seconds phase in which they dash towards you, swing their sword twice, and then spin across half the screen. This attack lasts for multiple seconds, can always hit you, and can change directions three times. this is basically the \"I\\'m going to now roll back and forth\" period of her fight. Along with this, the humanoid bosses just love to shove themselves inside of you while you roll, causing you to get hit as soon as your I-frames end. You will roll through an attack only for the boss to move into your space and hit you anyways, it\\'s frustrating. Along with this, some bosses have attacks with minimal or NO indication. The 3rd to last bossfight in the game has an arrow-shooting character who will leap across the screen and cover the center with arrows. the only way to see this coming is to either look at her (which means your not watching the much more important boss that you\\'re actually fighting on the ground)  or to just always assume they\\'re about to do it, which is lame.\\n\\nThe game also has a bad habit of not showing or telling you what enemies do before they hit you. There is an enemy early on that falls on your head when you stand under it, and this is fine, but then they introduce an orange variation later on that can go in any direction and the first time you find out about this is when it chases you through a tight tunnel you are trapped in. You are given minimal time to react to a new enemy that you have not seen before, and you get hit because of it. \\n\\nThere are multiple endings in this game SPOILER ALERT and it is really dumb. To get the good ending, you simply play through the game as normal except you use a box of wind to upgrade your leaf. That\\'s it, that\\'s all you need to do. No choices, no gameplay challenge, just go use the box on the windmill and voila. This is unfulfilling and leads to the extremely easy final boss to being even more anticlimatic when you don\\'t even get the good ending. And aside from this, there are very few direct upgrades to your weapons.\\n\\nThe difficulty curve is really strange and is not really curved at all. I didn\\'t notice the challenge ramping up even a little, with most rooms in the early game being just as hard as the rooms later on. What I did notice was that there were many more cheap enemies that appear out of nowhere or hit you from off-screen in the early game and late game, which makes the mid-game my favorite. The witches are the most egregious example, firing large pink projectiles at you from off-screen that have very vague hitboxes (the attack is made of mostly transparent square sprites and I think a transleucent pink ball) and enemy melee attacks can similarly start off-screen. Compound this with the fact that your basic attack does nothing to deter enemy attacks, and a lot of situations can feel cheap and un-reactable. This is basically gone in the mid-game, but it returns in the late game with enemies like paintings and statues that blend in with background elements until you start recognizing their exact shape, as well as some enemies that literally appear from the walls and hit you. The very last stretch of the game is 3 bossfights that feel completely out of order. the first one is the most difficulat, featuring two different characters with hard to read attacks, the second one boils down to a guessing game similar to 1 ball 3 cups, and the last one is a cakewalk that ends the game completely anitclimactically \\n\\nThe upgrades you buy from the single in-game shopkeeper are incredibly lame. Most of them are not very useful (there\\'s one that increases your damage and also hurts you randomly, which is totally useless when you\\'re trying not to die, along with one that applies poison to your arrows, which only helps in boss fights but is really not worth it sine the arrows aren\\'t very strong anyways) and in the end the only upgrades that are worth anything are the mandatory story ones that give you mostly bow and dodge upgrades and one store upgrade that makes your weaker attacks flinch enemies, which makes the game incredibly easy. Other than that there are money collecting upgrades I never used, a ring that tells you where secrets are, thus completely ruining the point, the aforementioned random death device, one that raises your resistance to bad effects which only occur from incredibly weak enemies very early in the game, one that increases the speed of your arrows from pretty much instant to literally instant and probably more I didn\\'t even bother buying. You can have two of these at a time and the choice is pretty obvious, which would be flinching attacks and poison arrows, and the poison arrows are just for bosses anyways. I really love this game. I very much would like to play this game, but despite the stats of it claiming there is \"full controller support,\" the game does not recognize my controller.\\n\\nI have an F310 Logitech controller; I have tried switching between Dinput and Xinput, to no avail. I\\'ve tried to find 3rd party software that might help bridge the gap, but I\\'ve come up empty-handed on that. I play on a Mac, and I\\'ve played numerous games on Steam with no problem; this is the first one I\\'ve run into in which despite my research and modification efforts, I cannot get the controller to work.\\n\\nBecause I really wanted to give this game a chance, I tried playing with the keyboard controls. I unfortunately kept dying in the tutorial forest grove because I cannot re-bind the keys to something that feels more natural to my style of play.\\n\\nThis is highly disappointing. Please do not advertise full controller support if you don\\'t actually offer it. For the price point, it\\'s actually a pretty coherent game. Pretty short (4 hours ish) if you don\\'t try to do extra difficulty modes or completist stuff.\\n\\nThere\\'s a ton of different games in this genre. Very crowded. If I\\'m gonna sum up what stands out about this one, it\\'s mainly the atmosphere brought out by the visuals, settings and music. The story itself isn\\'t that well realised, but there\\'s a good general sense of growing and pervasive [i]heaviness[/i] as you progress through. \\n\\nBasically, of the good aspects of the game I\\'m left wanting more. More bosses, more places, more gameplay. I\\'ve got to note that smooth and solid controls are core to these sorts of games, and these are pretty dece.\\n\\nAlso, although she doesn\\'t have any special powers, you eventually get to be a cat. Mew. Honestly one of the best and most stand out and memorable games I\\'ve played in a long time. Can\\'t believe I\\'m only just getting around to recommending it. An okay Metroidvania game that you should play if you like this genre. -Synopsis-: \\n\\n       Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a 2-D metroidvania where you control a cute little priestess \\n       named Kaho. She is sent on a mission to save her village from a dastardly curse threatening her land by \\n       seeking an audience with the queen of Karth. When arriving at Karst it\\'s immediately understood that \\n       things are not as they seem and the city is emanating the curse Kaho is trying to stop. Now it\\'s up to her \\n       to stop the curse in karst in order to prevent her village from being destroyed. \\n\\n-Gameplay-:\\n      \\n       The gameplay in Momodora is like a standard metroidvania with a twist of Dark Souls. You are fighting \\n       enemies while making your way jumping and hopping on platforms to boss fights. Progression is made by \\n       finding items and upgrades to your characters to unlock other areas. You have a set number of \\n       collectibles that you can use to unlock side quests and power up your character with more items. These \\n       collectibles are in every areas in the game and some are hidden pretty well behind fake walls or using \\n       hidden platforms to get up to them. \\n\\n\\n-Graphics/Sound-:\\n\\n       The game has a pixel art style that is refreshing to look at and strengthens the cute atmosphere. The \\n       environments are deep and well constructed. The animations are fluid and are impressive. The music of \\n       the game is really nice and meshes really well with the environment and the event occuring to the player. \\n       Boss themes are epic and inspiring while the background themes are reminiscent of the areas they are \\n       tied to. \\n\\n-Story-:\\n\\n       The Story of Momodora isn\\'t that deep, but is still a good one. A young priestess is sacrificing her own \\n       wellbeing (and in some endings her life) for her homeland\\'s safety. Along with meeting and helping out \\n       victims of the curse in several sidequests. It\\'s an inspiring tale where the weak can become strong in order \\n       to protect their friends, family and comrades. \\n\\n\\n\\nGameplay: 10/10\\nGraphics/sound/ 9/10\\nStory: 9/10\\n\\nOverall: 93/100\\n\\ntl;dr\\n\\nGame is cute, game is good, buy the cute good game A good cheap metrovania game. The game is plays at a chill pace for the majority leaving the player able to take in the pretty looking graphics as you steadily explore the map. Bosses are tough but nothing hair pulling. Another cheap metrovania game i played through not long ago called Environmental Station Alpha which i really loved is worth checking out if you like this sort of thing. Warning that game is a bigger map and has nastier bosses, but.... awesome. It\\'s hard to love the game when it doesn\\'t really give me a chance to.\\n[list]\\n    [*] No mouse support.\\n    [*] Can\\'t rebind buttons.\\n    [*] The only thing the game has going for it is that it\\'s cute and has a female lead.\\n[/list] Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a very good game. The Sprites are beautifully made, and well animated. The level design is superb and really fun to navigate through. Momodora also has an oppressive atmosphere that will seem to choke you at times as you feel the dread and despair from the environment and the characters of the game. Momodora has outstanding music, and I will be purchasing the soundtrack at a later date. This game does follow a story line from a series of games. But as far as I\\'m aware you don\\'t have to play those to get a full experience from this game\\'s story; as it seems mostly self-contained, but I could be wrong.\\n\\n My main issue with Momodora is that the game is on the short side. You can beat it in about five hours in your first play through. However, there is a new game+ option and a hard/insane mode; that will increase the game time and make an already tough game even harder. I also feel as though there was also a couple of bullshit moments with the enemy placement in the later levels; The one I remember most is that damn witch in the sewers.  However, most of the difficulty problems I ran into was because of my own skill. As this game does require you to use your brain to memorize enemies attack patterns.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight at $10 is a purchase very well made. A solid 8/10 it is a must own for any MetriodVania type fans.\\n An absolutely fantastic game which I almost never finished. The start can feel too punishing and doesn\\'t really represent the visuals of the rest of the game very well. However, once you get to the core of the game it\\'s amazing. Soundtrack is also worth the purchase for the price. Really fun, loved the art and mechanics. The only way i could accurately describe this game is aggressively mediocre. There are too many great games in this genre or in general to spend time on this regardless of it being super short. There\\'s a lot of things going for this game. Music, atmosphere, item collection, diverse enemies, etc. but one severe drawback from my pov.\\nThe game is challenging but not necessarily in a healthy way. Enemies are positioned to attack where it came off as frustrating. With game design, players shouldn\\'t need to approach a new area cautiously for negative surprises - we should clearly see and adapt without needing to die over and over unless we\\'ve memorized enemy layouts when they\\'re unclear. It\\'s the (main) difference between Super Mario versus the Syoban Cat game. This game felt as if it was developed to have more \\'random\\' risks than reward.\\nTo be fair, I only played an hour and a half on writing this review, but here are some examples from what I\\'ve seen:\\n- A wolf breaks out of a box that begins shaking when you approach it. However, the pixel art and lack of ambient lighting in that location made the wolf unapparent\\n- Witches began firing before they appeared in the player\\'s fov. There are multiple audio cues for when they fire, but having to rely on that is a bad accessibility move. \\n- Enemies apparated/spawned in undeclared locations, which includes the location the player may currently be standing at\\n\\nOne thing that may be worth noting is that I chose the \\'hard\\' difficulty - but that shouldn\\'t matter with a game design heuristic that applies across the board. Enemies inflicting more damage or having larger hp pools scaling with difficulty makes sense - that\\'s a separate topic from the issue addressed above. At any given difficulty, the issue would still stand; the only difference was that I probably died much more often than had it been on an easier difficulty. \\nThe overall combat mechanics make it interesting enough for me to give the game a few more hours of playtime in case this is just an issue of me needing to \\'git gud\\'. And I\\'ll still possibly purchase their upcoming 2019 title, where hopefully the same issue doesn\\'t persist (the trailers look great so far).\\nAs a huge fan of this genre, I\\'m still very eager to see what Bombservice has in store! so fun, great atmosphere! Lovely sprite work.\\n\\nIt\\'s a clean Metroidvania where elements of the gameplay and world are translated smoothly over from its inspirations, although that\\'s not to imply that the game is wholly unoriginal.\\n\\nThere\\'s plenty of challenge available in Momodora but there\\'s thankfully an easy mode lets you explore the game if you aren\\'t up to the task or in the mood for a fight.\\n\\nDon\\'t overlook this one if you find pixel-art metroidvanias appealing. Love the atmosphere, soundtrack, graphics, and most of all the gameplay.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit like a 2d Bloodborne. Not quite as difficult, but still challenging. There are three difficulty settings, so obviously if you\\'re used to Souls-like difficulty, go with hard, but normal was just right for me personally. The life-death cycle is also much faster than a Souls game, and the checkpoints feel like they were well spaced-out considering how long it takes me to run out of heals, or how often I die.\\n\\nI\\'m at 3.5 hrs so far, but I think I\\'ve only uncovered about 50% of the map so far. $10 USD feels about right considering the amount of fun you can get out of it, so $5 on sale made it a steal IMO.\\n\\nIt also helps that you can run it on a potato. My Macbook Pro can\\'t even run Civ 5 on minimal settings without the fan kicking in, but this game runs like a breeze, even on the high graphic settings.\\n\\nAlso, I thoroughly enjoyed the surprise boss fights! They me on my toes as I explore the map, and not in an anxiety-inducing way. There\\'s only so much you can take before accepting that it just isn\\'t fun.\\n\\nEditing this review to add more detail. I\\'ve finished the game several times since, and it deserves at least that much.\\n\\nI normally like Metroidvania titles that only get easier as you progress, but the reason isn\\'t because the starting zone is so ridiculously difficult to pass through. This game makes that mistake, populating the first cluster of areas you pass through with shield imps who are basically nigh-impossible to actually kill, paired with poison-throwing imps who carpet-bomb much ground (or anything vaguely near you) and are very annoying to avoid (and as it later turned out, these were the only armored and poison-inflicting enemies in the entire game). Maybe my inexperience with combat-oriented Metroidvanias is showing but I wasted way too much time trying to kill everything and constantly dying in this zone, and even when I shifted focus to just getting through without dying, it was still painful. At least this became less of an issue once I got into the next zone and started collecting more items.\\n\\nI don\\'t hate the Souls-inspired design like the occasional bonfires and You Died screen, but after anywhere from a dozen to a hundred deaths, Kaho\\'s final scream started driving me crazy.  The only way this would\\'ve been acceptable to put in would be if Dark Souls had also had the player character emit a similar sound on death.\\n\\nMy final gripe is the story. Not the whole thing, just parts of it. While it apparently continues a trend in the series of a matriarchal world where the people are accustomed to solving all problems with sacrifices, this particular game mostly offers an excuse plot. A darkness grips the land, so you enter a cursed place to end the source of it all, which turns out to be the result of a deal with the devil. (Sound familiar?) Once you venture far enough you\\'re told to gather a total of 4 fragments (actually 3, since you collect one right then) of an item which for some reason are guarded by the very enemies of the Queen and/or Church (the Pardoner and Derelict respectively, and the Arsonist would qualify as both). Who even knows why one fragment was hidden on a spiritual plane?\\n\\nThis game does do a lot well, like easier enemies after the first couple of areas, rare/unique rewards for flawless (no-hit) boss fights which help immensely when obtained as early as they are, collectibles to upgrade health and get even more useful items (although there is a limit to their usefulness as you only have 3 active item slots and 2 passive item slots, and using more than 3 actives in the same timespan would require constantly switching items during a skirmish). There\\'s also an optional extra boss if you want one more offensive spell in your inventory (or just seek one more fight), because the boss fights are just that well-designed.\\n\\nThe boss fights are what makes this game, and that there are so few of them is a shame. (At least the game\\'s base price is low to reflect that.) On my first playthrough I forgot about my extra items and fought most of them vanilla (on later runs, using items, especially the ones dropped by previous bosses, made them a walk in the park on all difficulties), and it was an awesome experience even with all the deaths. The fights were impressively animated and designed, with tight controls and fair i-frames in rolling/dashing (in Easy mode the i-frames are even more generous).\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn\\'t recommend this, unless you really like Metroidvanias and don\\'t mind the difficulty curve being the opposite of conventional (stupidly hard -> easier, instead of easy -> harder). A fun little game.  Be aware it\\'s not too long (3-4 hours not counting NG+), but it is really well done and enjoyable.  Be aware it\\'s not very difficult (I think I died at most 3 times on any boss).  Overall, definitely worth a playthrough. Nice game, short but it\\'s worth playing, a great improvement of previous games in the series. A short but very enjoyable metroidvania. I really loved this game. It is a short and sweet addition to the metroidvania genre that i found strangely addicting. A normal playthrough would take about 3-4 hours, but I have beaten the game 4 times to get all of the achievements (and because I just really enjoy it). It has beautiful art style and sound design with challenging gameplay and plenty of secrets to keep you busy. Nothing felt BS from bosses to normal enemies to level design, and I have yet to discover any bugs. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nIt is a good game that was well worth the money, especially if you love the metroidvania genre. I\\'ve been wanting to check this game out ever since I saw it in a YouTube video a couple of years ago, and now that I finally got around to play it I\\'ve got to say that it is quite a nice experience.\\n\\nI won\\'t go on for too long, so I\\'ll just go over the aspects of this game that I liked the most, starting by the gameplay, this game feels like a mix between a metroidvania and a souls game, it\\'s not very long, a normal playthrough can take you around 4 and a half hours to beat (that\\'s what it took me), however it has a ng+ and different difficulty settings (including a 1 hit death insane mode if you really hate yourself!), plus some stuff to find around the map, so it has some replay value.\\n\\nThe other part of the gameplay I want to talk about is the difficulty, I personally didn\\'t find the normal difficulty THAT difficult (just some fairly normal challenge here and there), I haven\\'t tried the hard difficulty so take what I said with a grain of salt (however, I can recall that video saying that the hard mode is quite evil) might update this review once I get around to beat it.\\n\\n[strike]Some of the hitboxes are pretty weird however, it doesn\\'t break the experience or anything I just thought it would be important to say [/strike]\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about controls, they are simple, fluent and easy to learn, the dodge can take some getting used to, but it really isn\\'t that big of a deal. The combat probably isn\\'t that deep, all you will be doing is mashing the X and B button (if you are using an Xbox controller, like I did) and dodging when necessary, but it does its job and it didn\\'t get old for me, the bosses will make sure you have to think about your movements and strategy.\\n\\nTalking about the bosses, a thing I had with them is that I found the difficulty curve is a little off, some bosses are considerably harder than others, and the final boss is kinda easy (this is in normal difficulty, I haven\\'t tried hard mode yet, so again, take it with a grain of salt), so if you really want a challenge my advice is to go directly to the hard difficulty.\\n\\nLet\\'s see, what more... well, the graphics are nice and the designs are cute, the protagonist\\'s animations are particularly well done; might not be the best looking game of its kind, but still looks good. The music is alright, a bit unmemorable maybe, most tracks are very ambiental, but it doesn\\'t really matter, it fits the game and that\\'s enough, at least for me.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it\\'s not the densest, deepest or longest game I\\'ve ever played, but for the price it\\'s a really pleasing experience that will leave you satisfied after the credits roll, and with some replay value if you want to extract all of the juice from it, just get used to the dying animation. The fourth installment of the Momodora series and the best [spoiler] so far [/spoiler], developer Bombservice takes all the best parts of the previous game and improves upon the formula reaching new heights, offering a game much larger in scope, longer, with more action, a bigger interconnected world to explore, wonderful boss fights, more interactions and overall higher quality of an already great series. \\n\\nThe amazing art consists of a wide variety of immersive locations/backgrounds, from sunny forests to gloomy cursed cities and abandoned castles, inhabited by some nasty-but-cute enemies. The pixel-art animation is fluid, detailed and highly expressive. The music is also a great mix of epic, calm , intense and somber pieces that compliment the story. \\nAnd while the story is presented in a minimalistic style it still manages to evoke the melancholic and sometimes depressing nature of the Momodora series - do not let youself be deceived by the cute and colorful pixel art style, the world of Momodora is dark and somber where happiness is hard to achieve. But with some hope still lingering.\\nMake sure you explore the map thoroughly in order to achieve a more satisfying ending too!\\n\\nI didn\\'t encounter any bugs, gamepad worked as intended (for me at least!). As for the gameplay, you can choose various difficulties if you feel you want a bigger challenge (the default normal was no walk in the park either and resulted in many game over screens but nothing extremely frustrating) and afetr you finish the game you have a NG+ with higher difficulty and different enemy placement, while you get to keep your inventory.\\n\\nFor fans of metroidvania platformers, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a small gem that you should not miss. I liked it. It\\'s worth your time and money. absolute masterpiece Very good indie game, good pixel graphics and music which sets a great ambiance.  Combat is smooth and satisfying, but also super punishing starting in the 2nd section but gets easier (or you just have to get better) as you keep going.  Time to beat and complete are a little light, but not even close to enough to make me second guess recommending this game. if i can summerize in one word how i feel about this game it would be....\\nperfection I can only recommend this game if you\\'re a huge fan of metroidvania/dark souls-esque games and have already played though all the better ones. It\\'s the equivalent of comfort food- probably not good, but it satisfies a craving. (As an aside, this is my entry point into the series, so keep that in mind)\\n\\nI\\'ll start with the things I liked about it. The world concept was really fun, and I enjoyed the theming of the main character. It really made me want to see what her homeland was like, since it\\'s only talked about in the game. I also enjoyed the way the bow works, and I thought that the charge mechanic was a good idea, sacrificing time to get a wider range/more damage.\\n\\nHowever, there are entirely too many faults to make it worth enjoying. I\\'ll just list them in bullet point form to save time.\\n- The scale was too small. I didn\\'t want to just hear about the main character\\'s homeland, I wanted to see it for myself, and levels felt extremely small and exceedingly linear for a metroidvania\\n- The movement was somehow too floaty and too clunky at the same time, and you were slower and didn\\'t jump as high as you should have in my opinion\\n- The melee range was awkwardly short and led to a lot of unfair hits\\n- It was too hard to dodge out of the way of enemies once you had committed to your combo which again led to a lot of unfair hits\\n- The enemies were not really designed with your toolkit in mind (I was able to snipe the first 2-3 bosses with my bow because there was nothing punishing me for snipecamping)\\n- There were a lot of moments that lacked polish and showed there was a lack of playtesting, such as enemies having such similar designs to the point that you could easily confuse them for one another, to there being awkward choke points where you take hits that feel unfair, to probably even more if I had continued to play\\n- Mediocre graphics and music. I don\\'t remember a single thing about what the game sounded like, the pixel art felt extremely run of the mill, the pallete was muddy and generic, there were talk portraits so you didn\\'t know what any of the characters\\' faces looked like, etc.\\n- And finally, an absolute lack of originality mechanics wise. They literally just copied the bonfire and estus flask system from Dark Souls and the upgrade/item system from Metroid. The best I can say about it is that only having 2 slots for passive items was kind of interesting, but the effects were not dramatic enough to cause you any sort of trouble deciding what to put there- and the fact that you can swap it out on the fly as you need makes it a moot point anyway.\\n\\nUltimately if you REALLY, REALLY like this kind of game... go get Hollow Knight instead. It does everything this game wants to but 10x better and it\\'s probably 5x longer. But if you already did that and this game is on sale, then knock yourself out? I\\'d say its just barely worth 5$ if you\\'re a fan. i highly recommend you check this game out. It\\'s really fun to play Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a game that has an incredible charm and feel to it. The combat, while not incredibly complicated, feels fluid and rewarding, and players are constantly getting tweaks to their tool kit that keep things fresh and changing. The beautiful art style and scenery brings you into the world, and the slowly unravelling story keeps you interested in what\\'s going on, always wanting to find the next clue or the next character to interact with. Definitely worth the $10.00 price tag. This is a very nice short metroidvania Extremely overrated. Charming pixel graphics, nice animations and music but all the metroidvania-like features are piss poor. Cheap level design, uninspired powerups, annoying enemies. 1 hour in and I already uncovered >30% of the map. It\\'s just some rooms chained together with enemies dumped into them and being tagged as metroidvania. me likey [h1]Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight[/h1]\\n\\nI saw my friend play it said it\\'s difficult a bit so i instantly wanted it. \\nThe game itself is fun and from time to time a bit challenging, but that didn\\'t make me rage at all.\\nWhen i got this as a gift for my birthday from a friend i instantly installed it and tried it and well 7 hours later and beat it.\\nI can say 7 hours well spent.\\nNever played the 3 games before this, but one day i will cause they do seem fun as well. I am new to Metroidvanias. I thought I would start with games with a high steam review score.\\n\\nI just didn\\'t find the game that fun really, not sure how else to describe it. It is obviously a good game given the scores but I\\'ll never know which bit of it people get a buzz out of... Too each his own I guess.\\n\\nI played Axiom Verge recently too, it was more drawn out with lots of tedious backtracking, so arguably a worse game, but at least it had an amazing theme and overarching story to pick away at.\\n\\nSo in conclusion play it if you are a Metroidvania fan.\\nOr if like me, you are just starting out on the genre maybe give this one a miss.\\n This is a great game. It has beautiful artwork and music, solid combat mechanics, and good replay value.\\nHighly recommended, especially if you\\'re into the Souls-like or Metroidvania genres. Have you ever miss the days of castlevania symphony of the night? Have you wanted to play a game that looks like anime but not the ones where the women in the game are 90% big boobs but women that look normal size? Then this game is for you.\\nTo honest I little worry about the females in this game having animated females. But thanks to the artist and SNES style of graphics making not only look nice but the artist have made them look like women and not sexual hentai girls. \\n\\nMetroidvania is this gameplay style done well. you get two weapons the bow and the leaf, now it might not sound like the leaf would make a good weapon but its more like megaman x when zero swings his Z saber fast and strong plus it can stun enemies. The bow can charge shot up to two levels, level 1 boost damage, level 2 shotgun arrows. \\n\\nAs for the levels its more castlevania where you explore to find more lay outs to open new routes to get around to bosses or saves or shops.\\n\\nThe story is just right to tell you what you need to get done. Your a young priestess that wants to save her home and stop the curse from destroying all life. Simple and ready to go. No long waiting for cutscene\\'s or any of \"Triple AAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYeeeeeee\" Bullsh#t of making you feel bored. fucking amazing. its an amazing game. but I have to admit its, really depressing and kinda echii, but if your into that stuff its 10/10 Cute, Fun, Short. Solid metroidvania. Theres a few problems, like the double jumping and holding to get higher is super finnicky and takes multiple tries to get right. Also you dont unlock the warping around ability till like 80% done with the game which is useless and nonsensical. Also theres almost no story, and the shops have pretty useless items, as well as a short overall game. The fighting is good, boss fights are solid, and in most other parts it works pretty well. 8/10. A very pleasant, although rather short metroidvania. The visuals are really pretty in motion, I\\'m not a fan of the overuse of pixel art in platforming games, but the quality of animations and some visual effects definitely made up for it.\\n\\nBoss fights are enjoyable, a bit challenging sometimes, but rewarding. The items available make quite a difference in combat and movement, giving it a good feeling of progression. Music is rather ambient, yet helps in building the gloom fairy-tale atmosphere.\\nFor those who like to dig a bit in available text, there is some lore to uncover, even if not a lot of it.\\n\\nNG+ didn\\'t change that much as I played it, some enemy placements pretty much. The challenges for achievements are rather tricky, would require finishing a game good few times to master it.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s a well done little game, one that I\\'ll probably get back to, especially since it doesn\\'t require as much time investment as other metroidvanias.\\n\\n+Those are really good looking thighs for just a few pixels used. i love this game make me remember classic game like megaman Story: Starts with priestess which uses red leaf to fight called kaho from sacred village arriving before karst city (sound like a pun to me for a word cursed) to stop curse from spreading that has been spreading across the land and her village.\\nTo eliminate the curse, she needs to defeat the queen. Some items often tells bits of plot too, similar to Dark Souls.\\nThere are two ending to the game, to achieve the best ending possible you need to find pond which you need to soak in the leaf you fight with and you get green leaf back which is more powerfull weapon from red leaf. It gets pretty dark in the more you progress. There are some hidden quests troughout the story like helping the skeleton man find his love again just to find her in her grave and if you visit him later, you will see his atire on her grave with him missing. This is the forth installment of the series momodora with this one being the better and most polished.\\n\\nSoundtrack: For this game is amazing, it sounds so mysterious and eerie and i love it. They are really well done and really fit the game. \\nThere is in total 21 soundtracks inside the game and they are all made by Elektobear.\\n\\nGameplay: Difficult, but a lot of fun. Controls feels great and character feels very responsive.You use arrow keys to move, A to jump or double jump if you press it two times,S to melee and mash it for triple combo attack, D To use arrows and latter you have upgrades that enchaces or when holdind D you charge arrows for greater spread and damage, Q for rolls which you use to dodge enemies and make yourself faster and you latter unlock air dodge which makes it even faster and W for changing items. Game is platformer metroidvania which means that you choose where you want to go with and that there a lot of items to collect.  Some you can\\'t collect right away since you need required power ups (like the cat sphere to get trough the tight spaces) to get to them, and some are hidden like in the hidden wall in the beggining of the game. Boss battles are most difficult parts of the game, especially on harder difficulties.\\nHardest boss in the game is definitly the queen which you need to defeat her 3 times in a row. Some items can be purchased for currency called munnies which enemys drop when they are killed. Collectables in the game are Ivory bugs which you trade off to bunny in whiteleaf memorial park, Health container which expands you hp a bit then collectables you get for taking no damage during boss battles which are usually very good items you can equip. There are 4 difficulties in the game, easy, normal, hard and insane. Trying to beat insane is very, very challanging, basically to beat it you need to go trough everything in game without being touched once on highest difficulty. Game is about 6 hours long or even more if you are completionist.\\n\\nArt: It has that 16-bit anime-ish art and it looks beautifull. Amount of details to the characters and everything around makes it feel gorgeous. Feels good just looking the main character moving around. Background has some movements but not too much like lights in some levels or swinging roses and slight shading of the background to darker then brighter (examle from whiteleaf memorial park), there are alot of particles that floats around like in karst city some white stuff, i assume snow. When screen moves with you the background moves with you too and i love when games do that.\\n\\nI highly recommend this game to fans of platformers and anyone interested in these kind of games. it is totally worth its full price even when not on sale.\\n\\nThanks for reading. ---{Graphics}---\\n☐ You forget what reality is\\n☑ Beautiful\\n☐ Good\\n☐ Decent\\n☐ Bad\\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\\n☐ Paint.exe\\n\\n---{Gameplay}---\\n☑ Very good\\n☐ Good\\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\\n☐ Mehh\\n☐ Starring at walls is better\\n☐ Just don‘t\\n\\n---{Audio}---\\n☐ Eargasm\\n☑ Very good\\n☐ Good\\n☐ Not too bad\\n☐ Bad\\n☐ Earrape\\n\\n---{PC Requirements}---\\n☐ Check if you can run paint\\n☑ Potato\\n☐ Decent\\n☐ Fast\\n☐ Rich boiiiiii\\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\\n\\n---{Difficulity}---\\n☐ Just press ‚A‘\\n☐ Easy\\n☑ Significant brain usage (pattern learning)\\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\\n☐ Difficult\\n☐ Dark Souls\\n\\n---{Grind}---\\n☐ Nothing to grind\\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\\n☑ Isnt necessary to progress\\n☐ Average grind level\\n☐ Too much grind\\n☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding\\n\\n---{Story}---\\n☐ Story?\\n☐ Text or Audio floating around\\n☐ Average\\n☐ Good\\n☑ Lovely (it didn\\'t have a complex story but it felt nice) \\n☐ It‘ll replace your life\\n\\n---{Game Time}---\\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\\n☐ Short\\n☑ Average\\n☐ Long\\n☐ To infinity and beyond\\n\\n---{Price}---\\n☐ It’s free!\\n☑ Worth the price (me: 50% off)\\n☐ If u have some spare money left\\n☐ Not recommended\\n☐ You could also just burn your money\\n\\n---{Bugs}---\\n☐ Never heard of\\n☑ Minor bugs (sometimes it freezes for a short time when you are about to change the maptile)\\n☐ Can get annoying\\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs Good platformer. Buy it. probably the best metroidvania This game is good, basically a combination of souls like and metroidvania.\\nFirst half is quite challenge while second half is too easy. Bosses fights are interesting but easy to read patterns, only Pardoner Fennel is tough.\\nBoobies Witch Is a plus point. Charming environment, great pixelart, a little short simple and cute\\ncool soundtracks\\ncool boss fights I\\'m giving this a positive review so you\\'ll maybe check out the game if you read this, but the game deserves a \"meh\" more than a positive or negative, because frankly it\\'s both at the same time. \\n\\nTLDR: Good mechanics, movement, and overall core aspects, atrocious game design. Like, wow, the game design in this game is bad. Not bad enough to make it not worth checking out, but seriously this is a steam sale purchase, don\\'t spend more than 5 or so dollars on this game. It\\'s really short, repetitive, and annoying in how its designed. Definitely one of those games that warrants a \"meh\" option on steam. \\n\\na little longer TLDR: Difficulty is really poorly executed in this game, but the mechanics and gameplay are solid enough that I didn\\'t hate the experience, despite a lot of bosses just kind of being cheap and poorly balanced. They do too much damage, don\\'t take enough damage to warrant their damage output (unlike how in Dark Souls nothing usually feels like it takes too long to kill, and it never feels like their damage output and moveset is straight poorly designed). I give it a loose recommendation because the movement is fun and fast paced, but I\\'d probably rather play Salt and Sanctuary if I wanted a \"Dark Souls in 2D\" experience. And yes, this very much is a Dark Souls in 2D game, and I\\'m not just saying that because it\\'s hard. \\n\\nThe review: So I\\'ll start by saying I haven\\'t technically finished the game at the time of writing this (though I have about 75 percent map completion, and there\\'s really not very much backtracking in this game so I\\'m going to assume I\\'m about 75 percent of the way through the main content, which in a game like this is enough to give a rough recommendation), so if that\\'s a deal breaker for you feel free to skip this review now (Edit: I am at the final boss now, and I completely stand by what I say in this review). \\n\\nThat said, I can give this game a loose recommendation. The mechanics and gameplay is overall really solid. You know that saying of \"it\\'s the Dark Souls of ____\"? Well this is the Dark Souls of Metroidvanias (though truthfully if you want something even closer to a Dark Souls of Metroidvanias, play Salt and Sanctuary; it\\'s like 2D dark souls in every sense of the word, all the way down to not having a map you can look at). At least sort of. There\\'s bells that act like bonfires, there\\'s these spikey seed things that act like estus flasks and replenish every time you rest at a bell, you die in 1-2 hits, etc. Which brings me to my next point, and biggest complaint about this game, which is that you die in 1-2 hits (though I am playing on the hard setting). \\n\\nIt\\'s not even that the bosses are particularly difficult to beat, but when you die in 1 hit at full hit points, yeah, that\\'s kind of not good game design. In a game like Dark Souls, if a move is going to kill you in one hit, it\\'s going to let you know it\\'s coming first. There\\'ll be a big wind up and you\\'ll have a year to get out of the way.\\n\\nIn this game if the bosses so much as scratch their fucking nutsacks, woop zoop sloop it\\'s back to the bell for you! And pretty much every boss is like this. Very little start up, kills you in one hit. To add insult to injury, the estus seeds (Idk what their name actually is so I\\'ma call \\'em that for this review) don\\'t level up as far as I\\'m aware in terms of how much they heal, and I\\'m 75 percent of the way through the game and I\\'ve had 5 for 90 percent of my playtime. They also heal fucking pathetic amounts of health. Like, if you take one hit you end up using literally half your estus just so you can survive another hit. \\n\\nEdit: Okay so as I\\'m writing this review, I pulled up the items page, and yeah I missed a few of the bellflowers (estus flasks), but my point still stands that in a game where you can\\'t upgrade your hit points through leveling and need to find powerups to do that, dying in one hit from low lag attacks is still just not great game design. I mean I get that it\\'s easy to just have a game kill you in one hit instead of actually balancing difficulty, but frankly if you want a brutally hard souls-like metroidvania I\\'d recommend Salt and Sanctuary or Hollow Knight (though frankly neither of those are brutally hard IMO, but they\\'re certainly harder than your average video game). \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a good time, but the difficulty spikes during the boss fights just becomes unfun after a while, as you get tired of getting really close to killing something and then dying in one hit because maybe you aren\\'t completely perfect and the bosses attacks aren\\'t super telegraphed a lot of the time. You just feel like you got cheated out of a victory more times than you feel like you genuinely lost because you fucked up. \\n\\nAnd no, this isn\\'t a case of \"Git Gud\", so go eat a fuckin shoe you darn tootin\\' hooligans. I\\'ve noticed that most metroidvanias are either really pretty but don\\'t play that well or have great gameplay but just don\\'t look all that nice, I really like how this one gives you the best of both worlds! Everyone should play this, it\\'s amazing! A quality metroidvania for a good price. the only problem I had was the length, as it was a bit short. At first I thought this game was really hard until I realized your items are replenished when you save. Kind of like the Etus Flask from Dark Souls. After that I had a much better time.\\n\\nThe presentation is certainly neat. Graphics, animations, sound effects, music... it\\'s all good.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I find the level design rather lacking. The layout of the map and the teleport spots don\\'t seem very thoughtfully picked. Neither do the enemy placements. The second time you encounter the mages (or witches, whatever) you get hit from a source you can\\'t even see because the screen is so big and there are other enemies to take care of before. At that point it is too early to ask the player to pay attention to what is telegraphed via sound.\\n\\nAlso some enemies don\\'t even turn around when you hit them in the back. They didn\\'t expect you to backtrack even though this is a metroidvania game.\\n\\nYou open up some shortcuts to straighten out your way from the save point to the boss, which is nice. \\n\\nThere are some secrets, collectibles / upgrades and equipment but I find that pretty shallow. You learn exactly one more move, the rest is available from the start and it\\'s not very deep. Oh yeah, you can turn into a cat but that is also underwhelming. Also, the game is not that long. Aria of Sorrow or what have you is twice its size.\\n\\nIt\\'s not like the game is without merits. There is fun to be had... as long as you keep your expectations under control. And I wouldn\\'t spend more than 5 bucks on it. The art is the only good part. Here\\'s a long list of cons.\\n\\n- checkpoints are handled terribly, never placed close by major parts of the game and the game doesn\\'t have the decency to save/heal after bosses which can lead to some obnoxious cancer where you die immediately after a long as hell fight and have to go through the same 11 rooms all over again while trying not to take damage just to try again\\n- enemies don\\'t drop anything except money. there\\'s an item to change that to restoring a bit of health. you can\\'t have both and they don\\'t drop any consumable refills so after a short while there\\'s hardly any reason to kill them\\n- the highest damaging moves bosses can do are the ones that are the hardest to react to\\n- bosses in general are excessively basic, with one move you won\\'t get hit by, one move that\\'s obnoxious, and then one fair one. some of them just shrug off your bow for no reason and others make close combat such a risk that you have to hang back and shoot them like it\\'s devil may cry 2\\n- there\\'s one boss that has an enemy in the bit of the room prior to the arena and that enemy will make the fight immensely painful if not genuinely impossible if you decide not to kill it.\\n- most of the game is just trial and error and after a while you\\'ll just air dash through most of the game recklessly because combat isn\\'t worth it and you\\'re getting bored\\n- too many instant kill spikes and death pits creating artificial difficulty, padding, and causing you to die in otherwise harmless rooms and lose progress because you thought this game wouldn\\'t let you die there\\n- finding out how to progress often boils down to wandering aimlessly until you find one off room you missed that was hiding a major collectible (final crest, the transformation to get under small walkways) or how to progress further (that one sky area place)\\n- two of four major upgrades are useless bow upgrades, the other is a fast travel option you\\'ll probably get *last* when you\\'ve known about it since the first bell checkpoint (the warp)\\n- it\\'s a metroidvania but most of the items you get are either basic stat change active items or whatever passives you\\'ll forget about and most of them are bought, not found. health upgrades are hidden and there\\'s tiny little 4 pixel bug collectibles that only give you money\\n- speaking of buying items, the amount of money you have to grind just to get anything worthwhile is ridiculous\\n- there\\'s multiple difficulties but it just lowers your health and maybe adds enemies which is the worst way to make this game different. there\\'s also a new game+ for some reason that adds the same enemies.\\n- super easy to miss the true ending and both endings are depressing anyway, you either die and accomplish nothing or fade from existence to save a land with nothing in it but dead people and cardboard characters\\n- there\\'s a boss in here where you have to hit the real enemy out of an increasing group of clones but it boils down to a dumb luck timesink that\\'ll make you want to stop playing and then you find out that\\'s the second-to-last boss\\n- music isn\\'t memorable at all, not even the boss theme. nothing to hum or listen to after playing.\\n- the game opens very pretty but then every area after that is dark, bland, or depressing. too much grey and brick everywhere.\\n- nonexistent story, no character or encounter has any noticeable significance and there\\'s no background lore to supplement it\\n\\nThis game is grossly overrated. Poor by Metroidvania standards and littered with bad design decisions. Look at the features list on the store page. Pretty much everything on there is an enormous exaggeration if not an outright lie. Even the part about the graphics, they\\'re not much. You probably bought it because of the one boss girl with big breasts. She dies unceremoniously. There I just saved you anywhere from five to ten dollars. Buy something else. Buy Iconoclasts. Buy an actual Metroid or Dark Souls game. Buy Rabi-Ribi. Just not this, Jesus Christ.\\n\\nedit: *more hearts Great game! Yep this is a game I loved this game, all through out. It was sometimes difficult but still a very enjoyable and cute game. A solid metroidvania on the shorter side. Gameplay feels good, especially the movement. Looks like an anime-pixelart version of Bloodborne, and feels very Souls-ish in it\\'s difficulty, environmental storytelling and world-progression. Bought this for 5€. It\\'s a gorgeous game with fun boss fights and a great atmosphere. If you play it on normal and have any experience playing games like this, then the game will probably be too easy and too short for you. It took me under 4 hours to complete. There\\'s some optional collectibles I have missed and I will probably replay it on Hard difficulty.\\n\\nI\\'d say that it was definitely worth the price I paid for it, but would not have been worth 10€ (the full price). I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like Metroidvania style games then this is the game for you. Smooth gameplay, fantastic art work for not only the characters but the levels and enemies as well, Great music, and an easy to follow story. Also if your into having a challenge this game more than provides it. The creator Rdein outdid himself on this one and I can\\'t wait for any new games he plans to work on in the future. You can beat the game in a few hours but you\\'ll probably want to go for Pacifist and Insane difficulty achievements, there is a background story, good soundtrack and the pixel art does the rest for this lovely Metroidvania.. want more? Your weapon is a leaf, and you can transform into a cat! This game has some problems. \\n\\nRight off the bat, the way the combat works is that a third slash will automatically push the player forward. \\nCombine this would many poison areas, where the poison effect still lasts even when the animations look finished, you\\'ve got yourself some major annoyance. \\n\\nStill recommended, but that\\'s annoying. short and sweet metroidvania.\\nnot too difficult, on normal mode a full playthrough takes about 5 hours.\\n This game has weird hit boxes and I can\\'t quite understand how I damage myself at times in this game. nuts This is a fun 2D sidescrolling metroidvania style game. Its one of my favorites, definitely worth a few bucks and around six hours to play through. The controls are pretty good. Now I have to try Momodora 3  which I just bought for 2 bucks. Charming conversion of Dark Souls combat concepts into a short, but challenging 2D Metroidvania styled platformer, a whole year before Hollow Knight and a lot better than the clunky way Salt and Sanctuary tried it. Combat here feels fast, fluid, and satisfying, with appropriate weightness in every animation and every death feeling deserved. Short, simple, ok. First modes are too easy. Wait for sales or bundles. Momodora is charming game very reminiscent of the platform games from the 90\\'s (including the difficulty). Its spritework is adorable, even though the game has a very eerie vibe. While the game is rather short and can be cleared in a few hours, it has a very engaging gameplay and fluid controls.\\n\\nAlso, you can kill a Witch by slapping her in the boobs with a giant maple leaf. 10/10 [b] Got this game from Humble Bundle for a couple of bucks, and I\\'d have to say that it\\'s probably better at that price. [/b]\\n\\nSo here\\'s the issue with Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight; it is not a bad game, but with all the issues that the game has as a whole, there\\'s no way I can recommend buying it for $10, not while at the same looking at the competition it\\'s dealing with.\\n\\nTL;DR: Wait for a sale, this game is not worth buying at $10\\n\\n[h1] This Game is Padded Out to Hell [/h1]\\nThis game is extremely short, even by Metroidvania standards. Don\\'t let my 5ish hours fool you into thinking this is a long game as the majority of that playtime was done doing the padded out collect-a-thon that I\\'ll get to later; trust me when I say you can easily finish this game in less than 40 minutes if you really tried to. The way Momodora tries to get you to not do so however is tricking the player into spending time doing other stuff instead of just finishing the game.\\n\\nFor example, the game forces you to grab 4 power-ups scattered at the 4 corners of the map so you can progress to the final boss. 2 out of the 4 are useless bow upgrades that you will most likely never use, 1 of them is an unlock that allows you to go into half of the map for unlocks, and the last one is the ability to warp between checkpoints.\\n\\nYes, the ability to warp is locked behind an unlock you can potentially miss while playing the game, yes that\\'s a lot of backtracking if you potentially don\\'t grab it, no you are not told where these are, and no it\\'s not obvious where these upgrades are. When you have a game that has as big of a map as this one where backtracking can potentially inhale so much of your time, why the hell is teleportation locked from the start? Even then, teleporting is limited at that as you can\\'t teleport to every checkpoint, only a set few of them. It\\'s not hard to backtrack through the game, it\\'s just like why?\\n\\n[h1] Collecting Is a Chore [/h1]\\nLike many other metroidvanias, Momodora has a ton of collectibles to grab and a ton of ways to hide them from you. Now I understand how subjective this can be and it might just sound like I\\'m bad and I\\'m just whining but let me bring up two other games that do collecting fantastically, those being Hollow Knight and essentially the entire Metroid franchise. In Hollow Knight there are tons of collectibles as well and they all make a unique sound while you\\'re in the room with them. While you might not be able to grab them at the moment, you know they\\'re there and can come back to them. Metroid has a different approach by altering the surroundings themselves to show you that something is hidden. Maybe there\\'s cracks in a wall, maybe it\\'s blocked by a door you can\\'t open yet, you know something is there and like Hollow Knight, you can come back to it if you can\\'t figure it out at the moment.\\n\\nMomodora doesn\\'t do either of these. Rather than, you know, making collecting fun, Momodora has illusory walls that look like every other wall, \"invisible platforms\", and tiny as hell collectibles that you can potentially miss if you\\'re not paying attention. The game does however offer a way to help you notice these hidden objects, but even Momodora finds a way to mess it up. It comes in the form of an item that you have to equip, therefore blocking you from using another item in it\\'s place and it makes a sound that blends in with all the other sounds of the game or a vibration if you\\'re on controller.\\n\\nSo basically, if you\\'re not using controller like I was while playing this game, you can be playing the game listening for a sound that might never come up because you just flat out don\\'t know what it sounds like and miss so many of the collectibles the game has to offer. Like why? How hard is it to turn up the volume of the sound? How hard is it to give some indication that these walls can break away? How hard is it to make these collectibles just a little bit bigger?\\n\\nYou\\'re going to be running around big rooms just ramming yourself into walls trying to find some hidden thing because the game just flat out doesn\\'t want you find what it\\'s hiding, and even then the thing it might be hiding could just be completely useless!\\n\\nI think I\\'ve made my point that this isn\\'t worth the money. Here\\'s a couple of other metroidvanias that you\\'re probably enjoy more than Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight. If you can find this game for less than $10 then pick it up, it\\'s fine. But compared to the competition? Nah.\\n\\nSuper Metroid / Metroid Fusion - Free just emulate them\\nHollow Knight - $15\\nOri and the Blind Forest - $20\\n\\nAll of these offer way more content for your time than Momodora ever could without cheating you for it When I opened this game, I realized that I really liked this game.\\nI opened this game for the first time and I finished it.\\nI really enjoy finding hidden things and exploring the map to 100%.\\nadvantage:\\n1.Excellent combat system.\\n2.The game screen is very good.\\n3.Interesting BOSS fight.\\n4.It’s great to hide BOSS and hide rooms.\\n5.The game story is not bad\\n6.Two endings\\n\\nDisadvantages:\\n1.1920X1080 display with large black edges on the left and right side of the screen.\\n2.Some places checkpoint location is not good.\\n\\nI really like this game！ Incredible game. Realy good!!!!!!! Fuck this game. This game is great! It\\'s a really fun Metroidvania with stunning pixel art, satisfying gameplay, and a somewhat satisfying story. It also only takes a few hours to beat, so it\\'s kind of a good change of pace from games like Hollow Knight that take many hours.\\n\\nPlus you get to transform into a cat, so that\\'s an instant 10/10 for me. XD Just completed the game and I\\'m ecstatic!! The game\\'s brilliantly made and put together. Unforgettable characters and location, consistent story and immersive music. Well done to all the dev team!! If I\\'m to oversimplify it in just a few words, it\\'s a 2d-sidescroll Souls-like pixelated masterpiece.\\n[i]Eat. Sleep. Reload-save-game-because-you-got-hit-by-boss. Repeat.[/i] What\\'s hot:\\n- Lovely graphics, varied environments\\n- Some cool boss fights\\n- Challenging in places\\n\\nWhat\\'s not:\\n- Very short: 10-15 hours if you want all achievements\\n\\nOverall verdict: 7/10\\n\\nThis ticks all the boxes for a good Metroidvania. Tonnes of secrets, some decent platforming - and some memorable boss fights. And most importantly: you can be a cat. Solid Metroidvania action, more on the \\'vania\\' side of the spectrum, with graphics that are equally capable of being cute as they are atmospheric and creepy. Difficulty is tuned higher for boss fights than general stage platforming, and you\\'ll need the guides if you want to 100% it, but I have no regrets. An excellent game. Momodora is a short and sweet Metroidvania. It\\'s apparently the.......4th game in the series? It\\'s somewhat challenging but also a lot less unforgiving than say, Dark Souls, which I didn\\'t really enjoy, but a lot of the vibes, I got in this too. \\n\\nIt\\'s also got gorgeous pixel art. The game doesn\\'t overstay its welcome and I think it\\'s worth the time. Really enjoyed this game. Loved the art and music especially. Played it loved every bit of it\\nThink that dark souls with anime like character\\nHard but fair\\nMore then worth its price this series has gone pretty far, although I do wish there was more emphasis on character development.\\n\\npretty hot gameplay / 10 my pp harnd Sort of like a 2D Dark Souls. Roughly the same difficulty, challenging enough to be engaging without being frustrating. If you played this and liked it, maybe play Wings of Vi next which is sort of similiar but like 10x harder! I\\'ve managed to get the true ending, probably not anything special.. however... Jesus chrsit..\\n\\nHopefully i don\\'t have spoilers here.\\n\\nBasically, if you aren\\'t used to how the game works, then be ready to die 50 times like i did... however practicing and practicing helped me get through it. I recommend this game to anyone with patience and eagerness to pass through this difficult at first platformer. i especially liked Kaho\\'s idle animations, she\\'s as tired as i am. Looks amazing plays amazing. This game is great not sure why more people haven\\'t picked it up yet. Cute, short, simple, hella metroidvania style game.  Plays really smooth.   \\n\\nI just wish I could remap controller buttons. good metroidvania where you get to play as a cat Fine short metroidvania platformer with fluid gameplay, nice level and boss design. And if you give it a chance, try to beat the bosses without getting damaged, this gets you unique loot. Swell game. It\\'s my first experience with a Metroidvania, and it was a damned good one!\\n\\nFirst of all, the biggest most obvious thing: this game is goddamned gorgeous. I mean you can see it in the trailer, but I can\\'t help but repeat it.\\n\\nThe dungeons are awesome, and upon entering them they give you this inmediate feeling of wanting to explore them. The open-endness of the world makes you feel like you can explore everything at your own pace: At some point I entered a path where I found enemies that scared the hell out of me, so I went back and explored other parts of the map until I felt more ready (AKA power-ups). I mean, it\\'s typical of the genre, but I\\'ll still point it out as something I enjoyed.\\n\\nIn terms of gameplay, the controls feel super smooth. As tools you have meele attacks, a ranged attack with a bow, dashes, and consumable items. They all combine pretty nicely for fast paced combat, it\\'s very gratifying to kill enemies with them. Makes you feel cool.\\n\\nThere is a big con however: the bosses are terribles. First of all, for a big portion of them, their behaviour is completely deterministic. What I mean with this is, they do the same set of attacks in the same order, over and over again, which makes the whole experience less interactive. The bosses don\\'t feel too alive, but rather robotic, as if they were part of a movie with hitboxes you have to avoid. Also, since it takes a way the reaction part, you always know what\\'s coming. So you pretty much die the first couple of times you\\'re getting used to the attacks, and after that it\\'s like \\'ok, first he\\'ll do X so I\\'ll arrow him from afar, then he\\'ll do Y so I\\'ll move to the center to get two jump-in attacks, then he\\'ll do Z...\\'. Also, it\\'s VERY easy to cheese through some bosses. Some you can just arrow them from a distance until death. I actually forbid myself from using the bow and arrow to make a boss fight I was looking forward to more exciting. In summary, the bosses are a bit disappointing in terms of AI, so don\\'t get your hopes up. Do note that they\\'re not boring, though! You\\'ll still feel anxious and challenged when you first play against them.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s a good game. I enjoyed it a lot, and it got me interested in the genre! Also, there are cats! So, I recommend it! Its a good metroidvania\\nI liked it way more than Shantae\\nonly negative was the weird piano music in the church level I don\\'t need many words in my review. The soundtrack, the gameplay, the simple story, all of that mixes beautifully. It is not a long game, but I promise you that you will enjoy every minute of it. frustration guarantee Such A Great Game! A entertaining if somewhat short Metroidvania.\\n\\nThe Linux version works fine except for a few water reflections at the beginning of the game, that thankfully are merely cosmetic. Quite short, but great game, very well made yes you can swing leaf like a sword believe it or not i bet you dont believe it but you will when you buy it and play and then you will know you were wrong and i am right This is one of the best approaches on modern metroidvanias I\\'ve ever seen. Despite being a short game, exploration and skills are rewarding. With a minimalist storytelling, you might find out more about the lore by checking item descriptions and talking to NPCs in this rotten place. Combat is fluid and hard to master, with lots of items at your disposal and amazing boss fights! Soundtrack is also perfect and it really shines helping you getting into the universe. \\nIt\\'s also great as a speedgame, since there are no glitches it\\'s all about skill and mechanics (and a bit of rng but not really relevant until the very top)\\n\\n11/10 kahoPounce § One of my all time favorite games! So far, this game is great! You get to mix and match passive items in order to change your attacks up a bit, and theres a fair amount of challenge. One thing you should be aware is that playing with a controller is ALOT easier (In my opinion, atleast)\\n10/10 I try not to compare games to Dark Souls, I really do. It’s the game journalism equivalent of putting ketchup on everything, or playing the Electric Slide at a wedding reception. But I’m mentioning it here because it’s less about the difficulty or the combat, but rather the atmosphere and narrative as presented. Momodora really nails that sense of ominous mystery, that feeling of being in a hostile place where anyone and anything could turn on you in an instant. It backs it up with a steep difficulty curve and methodical combat, of course, and tops it with a helping of metroidvania design, which results in a very sweet and regrettably short romp through an accursed land.\\n\\nThe remote village of Lun has been struck by a terrible curse, and their only hope is a young priestess. She has come to the capital, Kurst, to seek an audience with the queen and procure the aid she needs to lift the curse. But what she finds is a city gripped by death and madness, the very source of the blight she intends to stop. Armed with only her faith and a magic leaf, the priestess must descend into the water-logged depths and ascend the highest towers to uncover the truth about the curse and strike at its origin. She’ll meet more than a few odd characters along the way, as well as a whole host of terrors intent on stopping here.\\n\\nSo yeah, a shining city gripped by a terrible darkness of unknown origin, populated by eccentric characters that give you cryptic clues. It’s Dark Souls storytelling to a T, and it works incredibly well here. Your journey begins in sun-touched glades battling wild fairies, but soon plunges you into gothic streets of eternal night, flooded tunnels beneath the city, and withering gardens choked with evil. The explanations for all these happenings are piecemeal at best, and you’ll face some bizarre bosses that never really get explicit explanations. All this plays into the atmosphere of dread and mystery, which helps make Momodora all the more compelling to fight your way through.\\n\\nFighting is what you’ll be doing most of the time, and I’ll tell you up front that while I found it quite good, it’s also bound to be stiffer than you’re expecting. Your priestess wields a magical leaf which can rend foes with a simple swing, but those swings lock her in for the entire animation. You have a three-hit combo while standing that does dramatically more damage on the last hit, so learning to time out your combo is going to be important. The aerial attack similarly locks you in, forcing some serious commitment to your attacks. There are no upward or downward strikes but you do get a bow to plink away with indefinitely, as well as some upgrades to its attacks as you progress.\\n\\nGetting used to the somewhat stilted controls takes some time, but they’ll eventually serve you well against the many creative foes and bosses in your way. Both can be staggered by your heavy attacks, and most common enemies can be stunlocked to death if you’re fighting them one-on-one. Bosses tend to have very simple patterns so most of the challenge is in finding openings for your own blows. Well, that and not getting hit, because everything in this game does an absurd amount of damage, like two hits and you die starting out. The difficulty curve is steep at the beginning, but a combination of mastering the controls and finding upgrades will smooth it back out and have you playing cautiously but confidently for the rest of the game.\\n\\nAs far as progression goes, this is a metroidvania through and through. Hunting bosses earns you more mobility powers and parts of the key object needed to access the final areas, and eventually a warp between save points. There are items to find as well, powerful passives but also consumables that recharge every time you hit a save point, which resolves that age-old agony of hoarding items through the end of the entire game. You’ll find a fair number of keys but also some pretty neat upgrades, stuff that will keep you looking forward to the next reward. Secrets abound as well, and the game even adopts that old metroidvania chestnut of having special one-off interactions, like tricking an enemy into bombing open a shortcut for you.\\n\\nThe presentation is absolutely sold by the excellent pixel art, finely-animated and plenty detailed to bring out the crumbling masonry and flickering lanterns of a great city in the midst of its fall. The sound design is on point as well, with intensely unnerving tracks right when you reach fog-touched graveyards and silent, subterranean ruins. My only real issue with the game, aside from the occasionally brutal difficulty spikes, is the length. It took me just over 3 hours to beat the game with its “true” ending and something like 96% map completion, which left me aching for more. There’s a new game plus mode that purports to change a few things, but that doesn’t change how small of scope the core experience is. Still, for a fantastic take on the whole cursed city thing, Momodora does the job with flourish and style, challenging you with deadly bosses and leaving plenty to find as you explore.\\n\\n\\n\\nDid you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you\\'ll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames.com/ or on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11322459/]curation page[/url]! I personally didn\\'t like the game. It\\'s very short if you were wondering, but that\\'s not the problem, the problem is the pacing, it\\'s really slow for an action game and it\\'s controls doesn\\'t allow for much attack variety. Hollow knight was facing similar issue, but in the end pulled out much more than Momodora.\\n\\nIt felt to me like an early access, or an uncomplete game, as if developers had an idea, but they kept cutting it on edges until they got this. I suggest you go play better games, like Hollow knight or Ori and the Blind forest, which for me is right now at the top. feels like a gateway to metroidvania, a light demo of symphony of the night The creators of this game, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, seem to have forgotten what certain words mean. Let\\'s take a quick look at a few words before continuing with this review, shall we?\\n\\nreverie - /ˈrev(ə)rē/ - Noun\\n- A state of being pleasantly lost in one\\'s thoughts; a daydream. \\n- An instrumental piece suggesting a dreamy or musing state. \\n\\nsymphony - /ˈsimfənē/ - noun\\n- an elaborate musical composition for full orchestra, typically in four movements, at least one of which is traditionally in sonata form.\\n\\nmoonlight- /ˈmo͞onˌlīt/ - noun\\n- the light of the moon.\\n\\nnight - /nīt/ - noun\\n- the period of darkness in each twenty-four hours; the time from sunset to sunrise.\\n- the period of time between afternoon and bedtime; an evening.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve never played classic Castlevania games before you might not notice the fact that the authors of this game basically ran Symphony of The Night through thesaurus.com resulting in an awful mishmash of a title that would make Frankenstein\\'s monster think \"well, at least I\\'m not that.\"   \\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an obvious rip-off of Castlevania: Symphony of The Night with a 100% thesaurus-ed title and 0% of the fun. \\n\\n---\\n\\nNow the full review: \\n\\nThere has been a trend as of late with moron developers where they seem to think that players actively want an unbalanced amount of difficulty shoved down their throats from the moment you press start. I call it \"The Cuphead Effect\" but many could argue it started with the cancer sometimes known as Dark Souls. Anyway, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (or as I will call it from now on: Momodora: We Totally aren\\'t ripping off Symphony of the night with this title via similar words like Reverie (WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR for short)) apparently is on the Cuphead Effect bandwagon. \\n\\nFrom early on in WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR, you will spend most of your time desperately scrambling for save points due to the fact that health and item restoration can only occur there prompting you to wonder \"when does the fun start?\" Here\\'s a spoiler; it doesn\\'t. \\n\\nThe health restoration items you get only give you about one full bar of restoration combined and anything that can fart while looking in your direction will knock off half of your life like a scorned soon-to-be ex that has you by the balls in court. \\n\\nThese two points unfortunately create a consistent anti-pattern for WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR where you must memorize the enemy layout on each screen so that you don\\'t die for the 8000th time. This would be acceptable if I were playing hard mode but I was playing on normal. If I wanted to memorize useless crap for the sake of progress, I’d go to a 1950s high school and recite Latin. For most new rooms, I ended up cheesing my way through WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR by firing arrows at every height I could just to identify where an enemy \"might\" be via rumbles in my controller. To me, this anti-pattern is just boring and removes a lot of the fun from WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR. \\n\\nDespite this, the developers saw fit to add even more annoyance to the game with no tells. You see, there are several rooms later in WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR that give you no warning of traps (like arrows coming out of the wall, among other things). You just have to know they are there. This creates a second anti-pattern with WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR. With how ruthless the damage is whenever something breaths near you, this becomes a bad gameplay experience where your endeavors are more trial and error as opposed to having fun. With actually good games (that WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR clearly tried to rip off), there are warnings (even if you don’t know them at the time). You get none of that with WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR and it really ruins the experience when, after the 92 millionth time, you die because the game threw a completely unpredictable monkey wrench into the slipshod pixels they call a game. \\n\\nAlso, what the crap is with WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR designers and pits that cause instant death? I know this was a thing when we were first introduced to simple platformers like Super Mario Brothers but that’s not how you conduct a Metroidvania game. It’s an awful mechanic designed to cause frustration while enforcing needless difficulty on players. Nothing else. It provides no real value other than “well, I have to redo the last 20 minutes of my life now.” SCREW THAT.  WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR has this mechanic and it’s made even worse by the fact that it’s hypocritical. There are screens where falling into water means immediate death but then there’s multiple underwater sections. You can’t have it both ways without me calling out the developers for being on the spectrum. \\n\\nAlso, the warp function remains completely unenabled until you’ve played 80% of the game. Even then, it’s pretty useless. Don’t show us a feature early on and then deliver on it late and in a poor manner. It makes retracing steps completely painful. Every decent Metroidvania game has this function introduced EARLY. \\n\\nWTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR has literally no plot and what little plot it has lacks literally everything. No cohesion. No character development. Nothing. It’s a vapid piece of junk. Spoilers ahead so don’t read this sentence when I say that if you play through WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR and beat the final boss in a linear fashion, the game tells you “bad ending” with no real reason as to why. If you did read that sentence, well, I just spared you wasting an evening of your time because the game is so short it could qualify for entry into The Little People of America with pity from its own members. \\n\\nI don’t even care to know what the good ending is. I got through 90% of WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR  in a single evening and had literally no entertainment come from it. Save your money. Rather than buy WTAROSOTNWTTVSWLR, if you haven’t played Castlevania: Symphonia of The Night, go fire up an old PSX copy to see what this genre looks like when it’s done right. Cute and depressing. Tight controls and fun game-play. Mostly limited to leaf and bow, almost no side weapons/abilities. [strike] Bakman patch <3 [/strike]  Story was very much trying to emulate the Souls feel with minimal explanation and an feeling of unstoppable decay; not my ideal. Some minor flaws in story. \\n[spoiler] Why fight Fennel? She thinks you serve the queen, however you can meet her after planning to kill the queen. Koho refusing to talk results in the deaths of two relatively innocent sisters. [/spoiler]  Lots of little nothings strewn about for atmosphere. May lack some little touches, but a surprisingly polished game. Very enjoyable. Just finished it and i must say, simply amazing.\\n\\n\\n It\\'s not too revolutionary, it\\'s quite simple you could say, but what it does it does great.\\n\\n There are not that many items but every item serves a porpouse, the combat is good and the world is beatiful and really metroidvania like, also the progression sistem feels natural, and the enemies can be challenging without being really frustrating for the most part\\n\\n In a few words a good game to pick up if you like metroidvenias 7.5/10  In short:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Really enjoyable boss fights (Interesting boss patterns).\\n- Well written plot.\\n- Interesting story of the side characters you encounter through progress of the game.\\n- Easy to learn fighting pattern of your character.\\n- Simple inventory management .\\n- Decent price.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Sometimes (on some boss fights) soundtrack is \"not enough emotional\" to the situation.\\n- Unfortunetly the \"True ending\" of the game is only available after you find particular item, so you need to explore almost everywhere.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed playing Hollow Knight or any production with tags: metroidvania, souls like platformer, and dark/fantasy story i reccomend this. Go buy it. This game is a flawed wonder, and it merits explanation by what I mean. First, you must compare it to what it is, a Metroidvania Soulsborne type game. Similar games have been made in that vein, including Salt&Sanctuary and Dead Cells, but at least the former of those was better due to one single issue Momodora game has, and that is how enemy collisions are handled. In Dark Souls, Salt&Sanctuary, and Dead Cells, you are not damaged from colliding with enemies except for certain specific cases. Most of the time, the only risk in taking hits is to be within the enemy\\'s attack range. However, Momodora added collision damage to all enemies, and some of these instances produce massive damage. This on its own would not be so bad, but then you realize just how short the melee range is compared to the collision bounds for enemies. You will strike and enemy twice, and then take damage from colliding with an enemy, despite it not attacking you. I have many more deaths resulting from collisions than any other source thus far, because the margin of error is very small and difficult to mitigate. The collisions by animation are also somewhat inconsistent, so you are stuck getting hit from some enemies easier than others, as some enemies will not trigger collision damage when they are knocked back, but others will. This makes you let your guard down because the enemy is staggered, but then lose a fragment of your health to collision. While it typically is not the largest amount of damage, it adds up until the next save point.\\n\\nAfter finally finishing the game, I thought to myself \"was it worth it?\", and I quickly found an answer. Yes, but barely, and perhaps only on sale. Furthermore, its soundtrack is nothing special, don\\'t be a fool and purchase it. I should also mention that I beat this game in less than 6 hours, so it is fairly short, and I got much more time from any of the titles I previously mentioned in this review. Even though it was short, it was still fun, but I would prioritize those better titles until buying this one. Even so, you might just purchase it to smack a giant woman in her breasts as part of a boss fight, which is par for the sadness in the community I sometimes have to distance myself from. i\\'m new to the metroidvania genre. i think this game is a brilliant \"harsh but fair\" intro to the genre. i felt it was well tutorialised, exploring organically to find your way back to a save point feels fun and challening, the combat is hard enough that beating a boss first time feels like an achievement but not so difficult that i wanted to give up, it doesn\\'t outstay its welcome, and the story is sombre without being silly. i dig it a lot [h1]Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight[/h1]\\n[b]Review in one sentence[/b]:\\n\"A Metroidvania done right but shorter\". Fun game with interesting lore and beautiful pixel art. I\\'d recommend it to any one interested in metroidvanias. I look forward to whatever the developers do in the future. \\n[spoiler]It\\'s quite sad though.[/spoiler] [b]MetroidVania gameplay + retro aesthetic + Souls-style combat = Good Game[/b]\\n\\nThis is a surprisingly engaging and difficult MetroidVania which isn\\'t too long to overstay its welcome, but not too short to feel like a rip-off. They\\'ve also included a NG+ mode at the end. Completing some of the achievements can be a bit grindy, even with an unlocked fast-travel system, and they do a piss-poor job of letting you know that there are particular rewards you get for completing certain bosses without getting hit (a system which ends up giving highly skill players more power while denying lower-skilled players things that might help them, which seems backwards as hell...), but I suppose this type of game tends to attract people who will attempt no-hit bosses anyway?\\n\\nWhatever, it\\'s still worth a play if you\\'re at all interested in a game that combines MetroidVania gameplay, a retro aesthetic and damn-near Soulsian combat system. Good game. I\\'d play it again. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a fun action platformer with light metroidvania elements. It\\'s pretty easy and short, but it\\'s enjoyable exploring the map and fighting bosses. A nice game but I think I preferred Momodora III.\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Pixel art and soundtrack are very high quality\\n[*]Some interesting boss battles\\n[*]Backtracking is not too frustrating and kept to a minimum\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Characters and plot are flat and mostly irrelevant\\n[*]Only two weapons so combat never changes and becomes monotonous near the end\\n[*]Some frustrating aspects because they wanted to make it the \"Dark Souls\" of pixel platformers for some reason\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Highlights:[/b]\\nDefeating a giant zombie witch by whacking her in the boobies Awesome game, this game has great controls and the artstyle is quite pretty. The difficulty is well balanced and the game ends when it needs to. It took me about 5 hours to get through, which is something I appreciate. What a great, well-refined, and polished metroidvania. \\n\\nThe setting is a wild combination of anime, the middle ages, and fantasy. Momodora stands out not only because of the uniqueness of the world but also because of how well designed the entire setting is. The characters and bosses are all individual and aesthetic but at the same time fit perfectly within the setting.\\n\\nEach boss battle provides a great amount of challenge and it is nice to have a break between each to explore the areas in between, kill enemies, find secrets, and collect upgrades. One of my favorite aspects is the map design. The options are clear and you never find yourself lost. \\n\\nThere is not a single bit of filler content within Momodora, only masterfully crafted bosses, characters, and an amazing setting to get lost in. Solid Metroidvania type game with interesting areas and powers. The progression and pacing of the game is spot on. Great music. the game is surprisingly very well made. it was randomly recommened and since it was on sale i picked it up. The controls are tight and the combat is fun. The story is a bit of a mystery, really gives you a dark souls but in 2d feel. \"Respect Lubella\\'s Boobs!\" This is the best action/platformer game I\\'ve played since Hollow Knight.\\n\\nFirst of all, I have to say I\\'ve played this game on hard mode, and I had a blast with it. The begining is a little bit unforgiving, but it makes it so that you use everything that you have, especially rolling. Timming is key to this game and that makes it really exciting. Most of the earliar bosses can one shot kill you, but are far from impossible, in fact, once you get a hold of the timmings of the bosses attacks, they are really simple. The game also makes it so that you can\\'t just rush every single area you are in. You will be dying a bit, but each time you will get firther down the road until you reach the next checkpoint.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nPros:\\n+Top Notch Gameplay (best part of the game by far);\\n+Multiple routes to take/ Fun to Explore;\\n+Several items to choose from/Plenty of costumization for a game like this;\\n+Beautiful Scenery;\\n+Great Artstyle.\\n\\nMiddle Ground:\\n- Story is serviceble;\\n- Getting the true ending is a bit iffy, but not impossible to figure out;\\n- The game is a bit on the short side;\\n- Could use a bit more of platforming challanges, you have the mobility so why not?;\\n\\nCons:\\n- Characters are a bit too uninteresting, even the ones you interact the most are just kinda there;\\n- By the time you get to the end boss he won\\'t be a problem, even without any major power ups, his attacks are way to predictable and easy to dodge;\\n- Not enough extra content, which can be considered a pro because I just wanted to play more of this game.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, this games biggest asset is it\\'s gameplay. Its fluid, fast, and the ability to change between a short range and long range attacks make the game a lot of fun.\\n\\nIt gets 4/5 paws. I love this series madly, and this game is a beautiful closing. I very much admire the author, Rdein, for his talent in directing, coding, art and music, as this is a truly a beautiful work of art, and the \"game\" is just a medium to it. Great experience! Thank you, all devs and patreons! gameplay is really fun, but i think that the final boss was really anticlimactic... i didn\\'t even noticed that it was the last boss until i killed it...\\nanyway, i still recommend it, it\\'s a really fun game Anime Castlevania Fun. What Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight does\\n[list]\\n[*]well:\\n- fair price\\n- not too long, not too short\\n- art style\\n- soundtrack\\n- atmosphere\\n[*]neutral:\\n- difficulty, especially in the beginning, it gets better over time\\n[*]not so well:\\n- \\n[/list]\\n\\nAll in all, Momodora\\'s 4th entry is a  very recommendable Metroidvania, which will hopefully get a sequel! The trailer got me hoping that every boss would be interesting, unique, and developed, like they appeared in the trailer, little did I know, (almost) all of them did appear in the trailer.\\n\\nNot a bad metrovania, could have been much better, could have been much longer.\\nIf you don\\'t choose to play this because of the artstyle, I suggest picking up Hollow Knight or Axiom Verge instead. OK, premptively i went into this game expecting to have a blast and... it just didnt deliver. If you\\'re looking for a good metrovania i wholeheartedly suggest hollowknight instead of this game. anway if you look at the message on the store page from the publisher you\\'re gonna get the opposite of what they say (except the animations and art those are pretty good and i like them alot). So lets start with the good, I like the art style and the colors really complement each other in this game. Now for the dislike, foremost the spikes in this game quite literally make me want to put my head through a wall. They are always a one shot kill and will revert all progress you had made up until that point. I could have my screen plastered with enemies and it would be less stressful than a couple jumps with spikes at the bottom. Speaking of dying the saving is basically dark souls bonfires except terribly implamented. Instead of letting you have a shot at reclaim whatever you gained after saving last, you instead lose all progess and have to redo everything. So after doing literally anything you would be a fool not to hult all progress, find a save point then save and continue. Combats alright, its repetative, the bows super powerful and the best way to not get hit is to spam it. You have as much survivability as a newborn deer in this game though since everything kills in 2-3 shots. Which can be called a \"feature\" of the game but theres little room for improvement with the combat system so really its just hard for hardness sake. Not to mention the death scream for the character is just one of the worst noises, i honestly try to die less just for the fact that i wont have to hear it as often. The bosses have no foreshadowing or lead up to them besides you stumbling into their boss room. And now for the dialogue, heres a little quote from the publisher \\n\\n\"Then there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people.\"\\n\\nThat is the biggest lie ive heard about this game so far, all npc\\'s so far have had 1-4 lines of dialogue with basically no personality to them. Its all boring exposition or what seems like filler, There is little to no explanation and you usually find yourself wandering around lost and accidentally finding where to go. The story has so far been uninteresting an i have idea whats happening besides me having to find a queen.  Overall this game is bland and lifeless with some cool pixel art thrown in.\\n\\nTLDR: Good looking game with bland combat system and even blander story, screw the spikes, 3/10 go buy hollow knight instead Awesome game, would\\'ve liked some more lore though: there\\'s many interesting characters set up for something great but the game never tells you what exactly for. You\\'re just left with your own assumptions, and while that works from an artistic standpoint, on a personal level feels like a wasted opportunity.\\n9/10 SLOW MOTION ON MAC, DONT KNOW WHY. SMALL ENEMIES COMBOS ARE TOO DIFFICULT WHILE BOSSES ARE TOO EASY. needs quick reflexes, quite difficult at hard level This game is great. It is not super short, but I do wish it was a bit longer than it is. I beat the game (100% map completion, but not all items) in around 4.5 hours, and I was definitely not rushing through it. The sound, visuals, and interactions with NPCs made me really want to take my time in each area. A word of warning, though: this game can be a bit frustrating at first, especially if you choose to play on hard mode. Its not that the bosses are too crazy or anything, its just that every enemy attack deals a considerable amount of damage while your healing is pretty limited, although it gets better over time, mostly after you unlock the air-dodge. Short yet memorable metroidvania. Loved the visuals, loved the ost, despite being rather short (I completed my blind run in 4-5 hours) it\\'s definitely worth to be played. Its archievements also boost the replay value a lot (see me: played it for ~13 hours as I\\'m writing this).\\nDefinitely suggesting this. A must-play if you\\'re into metroidvania-styled games. Really good Absolutely loved this game. Great controls, great artwork, REALLY great music. Fun and challenging platformer. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight has an atmosphere. The visuals and music mesh perfectly to create a particular feeling. The fights are fun and even a beginner to video games (as I was, at the time of purchase) can play. Sometimes, it\\'s frustrating to have to go through the same rooms over and over again (and fight the same enemies--they respawn the moment you leave the room), but it adds stakes to death. I think it adds more to the experience than it takes away. There\\'s an element of exploration, with unexpected, branching paths which connect in interesting ways. And the story of a mysterious queen and a pestilence-ridden land is compelling, especially because you don\\'t meet very many NPCs to talk to. You have to piece togther what\\'s going on. \\n\\nOverall, a beautiful, fun game with a good difficulty level and an atmosphere that sticks. I played that game about 2 hours now and it is great! \\nI started on hard directly and I died mutiple times, but i learnd and beat the first boss, then the second and so on.\\n\\nI haven\\'t finished the game yet, but even if you have to try many times it still makes fun.\\nThere is so many to explore and I can recommend this game.\\n\\n Fun little metroidvania that will scratch the itch for a couple of gaming sessions. I like to play small indie titles like these between bigger releases and I found that it was a pretty good length with a fair degree of complexity, but I wish the narrative was a bit stronger. I understand that there are several games that precede this installment, and having not played any of the others, I found myself grasping to make sense of  what little plot and character development is given to the player. Still, it was a pretty good romp, but the lack of incentive to continue with a New Game+ means  I\\'ll be keeping this one on the \"shelf\" for a while.\\n\\nPlay it for the charm alone, it\\'s good fun. My only criticisms are that I waited too long to play this, and that it ended too soon... Perfectly executed for the genre, the bits of story, the boss fights, the combat is simple and satisfying, and it has the right balance of difficulty to be accessible and also challenging.  I really look forward to what the developer does in the future. It\\'s a pixelated metroidvania. I liked it. Momodora is a real good time. The combat has a nice flow to it, despite the short combos. There is a nice subtlety that is present through every pillar of the game\\'s design, whether it be lore, story, or gameplay. The items you can find add a level of customization into the combat. It can get a little tricky at points, and sometimes it\\'s hard to know where you need to go next, but with a little persistance (maybe a guide too if you feel so inclined) it\\'ll be a satisfying, challenging, and enjoyable experience. If you\\'re looking for a good indie game, this is definitely worth your time. Great Game! A stylized metroidvania that I enjoyed all the way through. The only downside of the game is that there isn\\'t more of it! I was very intrigued by the setting and wanted to know more about the world and people in it.\\n\\nI think the difficulty settings and no-damage/pacifist challenges add some nice replay value which gives the game more bang for your buck.\\n\\nI will be picking up whatever this developer produces next :) Just a great little action platformer, calling it a metroidvania is a bit of a stretch though. Beautiful sprite work and sound design everywhere. Loved pretty much everything about it. lol\\n MOMODORA: REVERIE UNDER THE MOONLIGHT - 8/10\\n\\nBasic Info\\n-----------\\nGenre(s): 2D Action Adventure, Hack & Slash, Metroidvania\\nGame Length: 5~ hours\\n100%: Length: 10~ hours\\nAchievement Difficulty: 5/10\\nMissable Achievements: No\\n\\nBrief Synopsis\\n--------------\\nYou play as Kaho, a priestess on a mission to stop an evil corruption that as been inflicted on her home. \\n\\nPros/Cons\\n---------\\n+ Very satisfying gameplay\\n+ Great soundtrack\\n+ Not overly long\\n+ Good amount of side content and easter eggs\\n+ Short, but great achievement list\\n\\n- Unlockable difficulty\\n- Boring environments\\n- Almost useless warp system\\n- Collectible hunting sucks\\n- Enemy and environment sometimes match world palette\\n- A bit too easy\\n\\nDetails\\n-------\\n+ Momodora is VERY satisfying to play. While the game tries to focus on exploration (with minimal challenging platforming and no puzzles), movement is precise and fun to pull off and combat is VERY satisfying with great sound effects and enjoyable animations.\\n+ This is a 2D game focused on adventure. Of course it\\'s going to have a great soundtrack. Nothing else really needs to be said.\\n+ The game clocks in at around 5 hours which means it never overstays it\\'s welcome. Even after 100%ing the map it didn\\'t take long, because the game world is relatively small but very well connected.\\n+ I always felt like I was discovering something new and interesting which kept me hooked. However I will say something negative, alot of the cool stuff you find has no impact on gameplay, even though it\\'s in an area that seems like it should. Like, a long and winding route will only lead to an irrelavent interactable.\\n+ Only 9 achievements, but you\\'ll need to replay the game and explore every nook and cranny. Absolutely rewards players willing to invest their time.\\n\\n- I put unlockable difficulty first because this really grinds my gears in any game. Difficulties should not be unlockable, and I should have the choice to play on whatever difficulty regardless of experience. In this game, it\\'s \"Insane\" difficulty. To unlock it, you need to beat hard mode. And what is Insane mode? It\\'s the same game but you die in one hit. It doesn\\'t feel like a reward for beating hard, just a punishment and an insult. Luckily, the game isn\\'t very difficult anyway.\\n- Unfortunately, I found absolutely none of the environments interesting. The colour palette was generally very saturated and greyish with overly dark colours. No environment wowed me maybe except one. This is personal opinion however.\\n- Like Dark Souls, once you obtain a certain item you can warp to a save point from another save point. But more like Dark Souls 1, there are only a few you can choose to warp too and almost all of them are in very inconvinient locations.\\n- There are 2 types of collectible. You can buy a ring that makes a sound when you enter a room with a collectible but after picking up almost all it became almost impossible to find out what I had left. One of the collectible has no type of tracker so you don\\'t even have any idea how many you have left to find and have to wander the map hoping your ring makes a sound.\\n- I found in a few areas enemies almost totally blend in with the environment which became annoying as it happened numerous times. This problem is far more evident in just 2 areas so it doesn\\'t plague the whole game.\\n- Not much to say about this. The game is easy, even on insane. You simply dodge past all enemies and learn the 6 year startup of each bosses 4 attacks.\\n\\nPersonal Thoughts\\n--------------------\\nI really did enjoy the game. Turns out there are 3 games made before this but never once did I feel obliged to play them and you can easily play through this knowing nothing of the other games. I really did hate finding my last collectibles and I ended up finishing the game 4 times for every achievement. I don\\'t know if I found the story interesting enough to actually play the other 3 games but if they are as good as this i\\'d probably reccomend someone who was interested to play them.\\n\\nTips\\n----\\n- Hitting ANY enemy a single time completelly stuns them, makes them unable to hurt you upon contact and lasts FOREVER. In later playthroughs I found it much faster to just hit troublesome enemies once and just dodge straight through them rather then kill them. Because of this, the achievement for beating the game without killing an enemy becomes trivial except for one single room.\\n- You can unlock special items by beating certain bosses without taking damage. In almost all cases all of them are VERY useful. Bosses are so easy you may as well try and if you plan to do Insane mode, previous knowledge will make it almost too easy. This game is not a mouse-controlled game.  In addition to up/down/left/right, this game uses 8 buttons (including the pause/menu button, and the map button).  Combat uses 6 of them. I found that 6 buttons are 1 or 2 too many for playing with a keyboard.  If you use keyboard controls in lots of games you\\'ll probably be fine, but as someone who plays about 50% of games on consoles, I found that a controller made the experience much better.\\n\\nOverall, this is a perfectly-difficult game with good art and soundtrack.  Dying resets you back to the last save point, and I found that it usually took me 2-3 tries to get to each new save point. Not too easy, but never impossible either. Amazing art style and fluid combat, good game. An absolute gem - I\\'ve been a fan of the Momodora series for years, and I was waiting in anticipation for when this entry would be released. When it did, I immediately bought it, and I absolutely loved it. This game has produced some of my most cherished videogame memories, it is one of the games that made me look into creating games, and it was my introduction to the metroidvania genre. I can litterally not think of any cons aside from, maybe, that it is a bit short - but remember this is a game that was mostly produced by one person. It is absolutely worth the price for an amazing game experience and even better memories. Um dos melhores Metroidvanias que já joguei, uma experiência similar a série Souls, não só pela sua dificuldade e chefes, mas sim pela história, abientação e por cada item ter sua própria descrição, dando mais vida para o mundo do game. Sensacional! Really a cute game. Don\\'t play on the hardest difficulty, you won\\'t even pass the first boss. A few more melee enemies would be good.\\nThe boss drops system is stupid.\\nminor nitpicks here and there\\n But the game as a whole, is short, but good Cute action platformer with nice pixel art! It\\'s has a metroidlike open world with unlockable sections and spread around save points. Tested my ability and patience without feeling unfair. I found it pretty challenging, but I\\'m not very good at these kind of games. The controls felt thight, but you have to wait until one animation stops before you can do something else, which can be frustrating. Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit! I love this game so much. The gameplay, the graphics, the story... all in all a very fun an immersive experience, very pleasantly balanced and with challenging bosses that never felt annoying. This is the game that made me realize that I enjoyed platformers when I still didn\\'t know. Good graphics, good music, short and fun. Love it. A masterpiece Great game. Beautiful art. Lovable characters. Good ability system. I have nothing bad to say about this game. It is a bit short but, I think the quality of what is in that small playtime makes up for the lack of length. An excellent platformer. Beautiful pixel art, a great soundtrack, and fun gameplay. I found the story a little disspaointing, but this is a fantastic little metroidvania. A beautifully crafted Metroidvania with excellent art, tight controls, and gameplay that is satisfying and occasionally very challenging. Similar to the souls series in how it presents the lore through item descriptions and conversations, in how the character stories are developed and in the dark/sad atmosphere but it doesnt develop any of those aspects as much as a souls game, which can leave you wanting more.\\n\\nIt rewards exploration well enough and the combat is entertaining and a little challenging. Beating this game is like watching your fingernails grow.\\n\\nYou keep doing it, you might be interested, but it\\'s so difficult to not get bored at times and do something else.\\n\\n\\nBut I did\\'nt beat the game so what do I know. It\\'s kinda like castlevania, but with megaman zero sword combos!  Solid platforming, some unique puzzles and great visuals throughout.  What\\'s not to like? For someone who loves smooth pixel art-style, I LOVE IT!\\nThe bosses are not that difficult, but it\\'s fair enough once you get to know the pattern.\\nFinished the game and I hope you devs works for another game like this. Recommended with caveats.  The game is fairly tough until you get the hang of the dodge mechanic, but overall I\\'d say it was a good balance of difficulty and fun.\\n\\nOn the negative side the game is fairly short (at least an hour or two on my playtime are just from forgetting I left the game running while I took the dog to the vet), the mechanics aren\\'t particularly deep and don\\'t expand much over the course of the game and the storytelling and characterization are pretty sparse. \\n\\nI don\\'t regret buying the game, but I also probably won\\'t be replaying it or achievement hunting immediately, which is my usual bar for a fantastic game. Does the Dark Souls bonfire mechanic all wrong. You have to constantly run back to the shrines after every new piece of equipment you get to keep it. Every time you talk to an npc you have to run back as well or you\\'ll have to repeat their dialogue. Combine this with plenty of one hit kill spikes and an area without a shrine where you can\\'t leave to go back to a shirine and have to watch a cutscene every time you enter and this game just becomes frustrating. some weird design choices, but the core mechanics are real good \\ngood animations, sprite art and sfx/ost\\nonly downside is it\\'s a bit short Really great metroidvania. Good mechanics, tight controls, great art and music, really an all-around good game.\\n\\nSome enemies could use tweaking, though - the shield imps are a bit of a pain, you\\'re meant to roll past them but half the time they immediately turn to face you again anyway, and the period they have their shield open is too short. I also felt the little ghost ninjas that teleport in were annoying because you couldn\\'t hit them while they were appearing, but there was no clear indication of when they would become solid, and they would attack super fast once they were so it became a bit of a guessing game.\\n\\nReally solid game overall though. Looks like a fun game that I really wish would just change a few things. Mainly, save points being really oddly spaced out means you can go for a freaking hour without finding one or come across about a dozen in 30 minutes. You can lose centuries of progress in the blink of an eye due to how ridiculous the spacing can be.\\n\\nMore specific to me, I don\\'t really get why this game has to use the trigger on gamepad. I also don\\'t get why simple gamepad remapping is verboten, but here we are with yet another example of both, and a game that I can\\'t enjoy because of its arbitrary two layouts both being awesome at inflicting physical pain on me due to a very minor physical handicap. I love the game, great art style, love the sprit work but I couldnt get myself to play through it all\\nI will definitly buy it again to finish it but for now I want my money back. the gameplay is fine, the boss fights are ok, the game needs better music, and enemies are extremely annoying at times, the game is quite hard even on normal mode, I died quite alot at certain parts having to redo them each time I died, which was most of the time spent playing the game. overall I liked the game I just couldnt finish it. Momodora is a very cute game, everything is so pretty and AYAYA.\\nPersonaly, I loved the hours i put playing this game, and besides been an normal metroidvania, it\\'s does its job quite well.\\nThe attention to details in the history, animation, gameplay make it obvious the effort and love the devs had put into this game.\\n\\nSo, momodora is a great game and I liked it. I thought it was a pretty good game. It looked nice, it was functional and the difficulty was not too bad for normal mode. Yes, you will die if you are a normal human, but it is not impossible after some practice.\\nThe music fits the somber theme of the game, though I am not sure if listening to the soundtrack alone is going to be as enjoyable as listening to it in-game.\\n\\nThe only annoyances I have with the game is lack of story, game shortness and the Lubella boss fight. Story is enough to give you an idea of what is happening, but that is it.\\nGame feels a bit short, but that is probably because I am used to the older Metroid games that I played as a kid, which seemed long and had a bit more story. My record on the game is shorter than it really was, since I would pause the game and talk to someone.\\nAs for Lubella, you can only attack her chest, which directly translates to \"breasts\". Come to think of it, that is actually funny and not annoying, but no way I am going to do that fight when parents are around.\\n\\n= tl;dr =\\n+Pros\\n-Fun game.\\n-Nice animations and artwork.\\n-Fitting music.\\n\\n+Cons\\n-Little story.\\n-Short game\\n\\n+Amusing\\n-Winning a boss fight by swatting breasts.\\n Spooky atmosphere, beautiful graphics, excellent gameplay.\\nIt has some game mechanics [i]just like Dark Souls[/i].\\n\\nIf you like Metroidvanias, you\\'ll love this one! unfun metroidvania game with lackluster gameplay\\n\\npros:\\n- decent pixel art\\n\\ncons:\\n- music is very bland\\n- characters are forgettable\\n- boring enemy designs: they have like 1 or 2 different attacks\\n- similarly, bosses have EXTREMELY simple attack patterns and so every boss fight is more of a test of patience than it is a mechanical challenge\\n- raising difficulty has no notable difference other than having a way smaller health bar (playing insane difficulty is a slap in the face since you start with like 1 hp and the game becomes a no-hit run, which makes it really frustrating)\\n\\nconclusion: this game is bland + gameplay\\n+ visuals\\n+ music\\n+ story\\n\\n- a bit too short\\n\\nI also recommend all 3 prequels (not nearly as good, but still worth it if you\\'re just trying to kill some time), Momodora 3 is available on steam  and 1-2 here https://rdein.itch.io/momodora-i and https://rdein.itch.io/momodora-ii Going into this game i knew nothing about it and since it was on sale and seemed kinda interesting I brought it, this was money well spent and i was very suprised to how good the game was. \\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a pixel art, metroidvania, platforming, action-adventure game with an anime type style, you play as a priestess who sets out to save the world from a curse with just a leaf for a weapon, you meet interesting characters along the way and traverse a very intricate world. This is the fourth installment in the Momodora franchise though you dont have to play the other games to know what is going on, the first two games are free on the developers site while the third is available on steam and you could check it out as well.\\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*] The pixel art looks amazing and the sprites of the characters are also well made \\n[*] The gameplay is really fun with tight controls and fluid motions, there are also various gameplay mechanics as well and overall it is just fun to play the game\\n[*] The soundtrack is beautiful and i personally really loved it especially the score during the boss fights.\\n[*] The world and levels are very well made as even backtracking does not feel like a chore, the way the levels are laidout and the world is built is on par with level design of games like Dark Souls 1.\\n[*] The bosses are amazing and really memorable, they are also really fun to fight.\\n[*] The game is hard but still does not feel impossible and i feel the difficulty level is just right \\n[*] The game is well paced and it does not falter anywhere from start to finish.\\n[*] The game is non-linear and exploring is rewarding and fun\\n[/list]\\n[h1] Cons[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*] The final boss could have been designed better in terms of both looks and its attacks, the difficulty should have also been increased but it is still fun to fight against and is still harder than most of the other bosses.\\n[*] After the final boss they should have shown what happens to the other characters you met on the way, and the fate of th world instead of just a text saying what happened.\\n[*] Some people complain about the length of the game which is short but i feel its just right, this is totally up to the players to decide upon.\\n[*] Not much replay value\\n[/list]\\nMomodora: R.U.T.M is a fun experience and one worth experiencing if you love platforming games, metroidvania type games or action adventure games that are also difficult. The original game took inspiration from cave story which is evident if you play the first game and this fourth installment feels similar to cave story along with other games like salt and sanctuary, Dark souls and Metroid type games so if you like these type of games then this game is worth a try. The game does go on sale and is mostly on 50 to 60% sale so you could get it during those times.\\n8/10 Very clean metroidvania experience with crisp controls and an atmospheric world. Whilst some sections can be difficult if not played carefully, I never felt like any particular death was unfair or couldn\\'t have been avoided,\\n\\nGot it on sale for -60%, having now played it (cleared in 4ish hours) I could say it\\'d be worth fully price. fun litte metroidvania style game, the style reminds me of games like Undertale and Cave Story. \\ndefinitly worth a playtrough! [Dramatic Face turn !!!]\\nAwesome scene I ever see A worth playing Metroidvania game.\\nIf some Lv - up elements would be better. 最吼的 Needs More health Metroidvanias tend to be a dime-a-dozen these days, and while Momodora claims it\\'s not a game like that, I feel like it serves as an adequate description to someone who wants an idea of what to expect from the game. That doesn\\'t mean Momodora isn\\'t unique or doesn\\'t stand out in the genre, far from it. Giving my overall thoughts on it right now, I very much enjoyed my time playing the game.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t exactly start out strong though. You get some dialogue explaining what\\'s going on, where you are, and why you\\'re here. Aside from some other story bits and lore to find, that\\'s about it. Its story is minimalistic, and things like item descriptions and other dialogue from NPCs only add so much to the story and lore of the game. It\\'s decent, but it\\'s not very compelling to me and didn\\'t leave me wanting to know more, even after the credits rolled.\\n\\nWhat DID hold my attention though was just about everything else. The presentation of the game is fantastic, boasting excellent backgrounds with distinct colors and imagery, combined with top notch sprites, especially for Kaho and other major characters who have a number of fluid animations, poses, and other small details to add character to them. The music is also well done, having a mix of soft and somber tunes (ex. being the Memorial Park with its main beat giving off this depressing feeling to this distorted area), as well as more menacing and unnerving music (ex. The Cinder Chambers and Underground Grave). Boss music is hit or miss, but the good ones are good (ex. Final Boss and Fennel being the standouts).\\n\\nNext up on the category of hit or miss, let\\'s talk gameplay. For the most part, I think the gameplay is great, but there are some faults that prevent it from reaching the peak it might have hit. So, what\\'s the game like? Well, it\\'s a 2-sidescroller with an emphasis on combat and exploration, ala your other Metroidvanias and such (hence my calling it like one of those games earlier). You explore fight, collect power-ups and items to improve you character, and run around trying to figure out where to go next.\\n\\nFor combat, you have two different weapons at your disposal; a leaf which servers as your melee weapon and your bow which is your ranged weapon. You get both from the start and they both deal the same amount of damage to enemies without any enhancements. The leaf is short-range, can do single strikes or chain together to make a 3 hit combo, or when jumping allows to to do a strong aerial attack in the direction you\\'re facing. It also staggers enemies unlike the bow which can\\'t stagger enemies or bosses without improvements. The bow is long-range, fires about 1-2 arrows a second, and moves in a straight line until it hits a wall, enemy, or the end of the current screen you\\'re on. Depending on how explorative or good at the combat you are, you can also collect magical items that offer powerful attacks as well but be warned that they only have about 2-3 uses before they run out, meaning you need to switch them out for other items or replenish them at a checkpoint. This all sounds well and good, and it is........Until you start collecting some items, which starts crumbling the balance of the game.\\n\\nThe reason is that you will turn your bow from a decent secondary option, into your main weapon that destroys most bosses and enemies with little effort. This is because of how strong the base power of the bow is, the insane range of the bow, and just how many items improve your bow (It gets an ability to charge up arrows to make them stronger, an ability to increase the speed of the charge, and several items that make a bow stronger and faster). \\n\\nWhich is odd since your leaf only gets a power upgrade to make it stronger if you can find it near endgame, and magic items which while powerful, can be tough to find and each one only has a couple of uses. Comparatively, if you can beat the first boss under a certain condition, you get a passive item that if equipped turns your arrows into poison arrows (you can get the item later on from a shop if you miss it though, and it\\'s around the mid-game when you can buy it). Those poison arrows can trivialize almost every enemy and boss with only a select few exceptions.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean the game is easy, it can be tough in some areas. This is especially true on higher difficulties which give you less health and have extra enemies as well (You have to unlock the hardest difficulty). Bosses especially can be nasty, just simply from their much higher damage output and health. Expect a lot of YOU DIED! screens, though thankfully the penalty for death is just returning to the last checkpoint you saved at which I\\'m thankful for.\\n\\nCheckpoints are spaced out well enough from each other, usually with one at the start of an area and another one close to the boss of the area. There are also shortcuts to find too, to loop and connect areas to each other along with the ability to warp once you find the power-up that lets you do so. \\n\\nThis all ties into the exploration, which I think is handled well. The map is pretty small, and most of the areas connect to each other with only the intro area and Karst Castle connecting to only one other location. This combined with the lack of warp at the start allow you to get accustomed to the size and scope of the world, and to make mental notes of things yourself. \\n\\nThankfully there\\'s a surprisingly low amount of backtracking, except for maybe picking up some optional items. Though, that doesn\\'t mean the exploration doesn\\'t have any problems. The biggest of which being that aside from some hidden rooms with some health upgrades, there\\'s not much in the way of extra areas, aside from a few small rooms with an item at the end or the only optional boss in the game.\\n\\nOk. That moment where I said the lack of optional areas was the biggest flaw of the exploration was wrong. The REAL biggest flaw of the exploration is the Ivory Bug sidequest, the only sidequest in the game and one that is awful for several reasons. 1) They\\'re hard to find because of how small they are in size. 2) You don\\'t have an adequate method of finding them aside from a ring that makes a noise whenever you\\'re close to a secret 3) Some are hidden in invisible walls 4) Some of the invisible walls can\\'t be removed, unlike other invisible walls which DO disappear when you hit them, making the rule of hidden walls and rooms inconsistent, which is a negative to me.\\n\\nSpeaking of negatives there are two other wants that I want to discuss in more detail, being the length and replay value of the game. My first run on Normal took about 8 hours in all with 98% map completion and most secrets found. Let that speak volumes about how short of a game it can be, since the first run is usually when you make the most mistakes and get the most lost about traversing the world. Repeat playthroughs on the harder difficulties took about 3-5 hours in comparison and aside from some achievements, a NG+ that lets you keep everything you earned the first time around (Except key items of course), some different ways to approach collecting 4 key items, and some difficulty settings, there\\'s no replay value. The things I talked about do offer some, but it\\'s not much and with how fast you can beat the game might still not offer much more content regardless. Though if you\\'re someone who likes short games, then this might actually be a positive.\\n\\nSo, to conclude, Momadora 4 is a great game to play with fantastic visuals and simple but effective music. It does have some issues which dampen the game\\'s quality like its general lack of content and having inconsistent rules with its secrets, but it was never such a severe problem that it ruined the experience I had playing the game. I can easily recommend this game to people, especially if you enjoy a short game, or just want another good \"Metroidvania\" to play (even if the creators don\\'t think of it as one). Really nice art style and sprite animation, and harder difficulties provide a nice challenge. Cute short game, I recommend it. Fantastic Metroidvania game. It\\'s pretty hard until you get the hang of it. Luckily there\\'s three starter difficulty modes--a fourth one unlocks after beating it on hard. I was able to run through it twice in about 12 hours. Around 8 hours first time, and 1.5 the second. 10 hours total play time, 2 hours of lost time due to deaths. The map isn\\'t really big. Nothing like SOTN, but what it offers is great. Some of the bosses are recycled, but with added difficulty. It was a bit difficult to get the resolution correct on Mac, but the developer had the assist in the forum, 6x screen size in the .ini file. Certainly recommend! absolutely beautiful game with some of the most incredible, fluid spritework ive ever seen. every area captures you into it, via the soundtrack and scenery. i found myself very often just sitting around to stare at the backgrounds and animations. definitely a 5/5 on the visuals for me\\n\\nthe gameplay is super fun, kaho herself feeling very satisfying to control. each boss felt unique, giving you a new chance to discover and learn the fights. personally, i didn\\'t find the game too difficult, with checkpoints with almost every boss being right before the fight, so you could easily run back in and try again. for the hardcore players, insane mode challenges you by giving you only 1 hp, so you play through the game without getting hit a single time. it\\'s fun and very rewarding, as every boss you defeat without getting hit nets you a special item to help you through the game. even better, these items can be bought from shops, so those who find they can\\'t keep up with the challenges don\\'t fall behind. \\n\\nbeing a metroidvania, the world is open to you after the first area, and you can choose which bosses you go to fight. this made replaying the game have more merit, since each time i was able to switch up where i went and how i tackled bosses with different upgrades. \\n\\nthe one flaw would be it\\'s length, i managed to complete there full playthroughs in 9 hours, and all the achievements within. however, the design and creativity of the whole game more than makes up for it. \\n\\nalso you get to run around as a cat, whats not to love This game was a treat. Very simple, bare bones, but everything is perfectly solid. If you enjoy metroid-vanias this is a great game for the price. The only real complaint I have is that the ingame map could be improved. It\\'s very helpful of course, but every single part is red. The various areas could be colored differently, making it easier to find where you\\'re at or wanting to go. Aside from that? This is great 4-5 hour time sink with some lovely sprite work. Buy it on a sale and finish it on a single night to get the best out of this game.\\nThe game is good enough to feel pleasant, but it\\'s not that great and it\\'s short, so I think it shines when you just see it as a small game. to summarize my experience this game captivates me with its music artstyle and story.\\ndespite having a hiccup here and there, control isn\\'t the best but it all unnoticeable when u\\'re to focused figuring out where to go :)\\n\\n7.8/10 Momodora is a short, fun and challenging game. Your standard metroidvania-esque platformer. The controls are solid even for keyboard users (which i beat the game with). There are 2 ending and it took me about 10 ish hours to get both of them. This includes me getting lost along the way but mostly out of my own stupidity. The story is very simple and standard. The graphics are pixelated but still you know whats going on. I never felt like i died or got hit because i didnt see something coming but because of my own technical fault. \\nTLDR: good game 8/10 I\\'m re-writing my review on this game three years later because I really like the Momodora series a lot and I believe that I was a little too harsh on the game after my first completed play-through. Also I WILL say that if you have the money lying around and itching for a visually interesting metroidvania I would still recommend this to people that don\\'t mind dealing with rather unpolished aspects.\\n\\nfor a tl:dr combat and story are pretty \"whatever\", critically flawed even, but the game sounds and looks nice.\\n\\nI\\'ll preface this with saying that I\\'m not sure if I\\'m the target audience, and that what I say should be taken with a pinch of salt. Sound good? Ok.\\n\\nIn Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight, you play as a priestess called Kaho, travelling to the Kingdom of Karst in order to seal away a curse that has affected her home village. Wielding her signature leaf weapon, Kaho does battle with all sorts of monsters and evil-doers in order to eliminate the curse.\\n\\nIn terms of story, I\\'m fine with the simple premise of it, but it doesn\\'t get expanded upon very well despite attempts to do so (more on this later).\\n\\nI\\'m going to start with the visual aspect since I believe that is what is probably the strongest aspect of this game. Animations are fluid, character/enemy designs are, for the most part, fantastic, and areas (before the last third of the game) look amazing. While there is a ton of visual nuance to a lot of things, there are a few unpolished assets here and there that definitely are just outliers, and won\\'t and/or shouldn\\'t affect any player\\'s experience. In the later parts of the game, however, there is a noticeable dip in visual quality in the Cinder Chambers, Royal Pinacotheca and Karst Castle. The sprites of these areas tile really visibly and not a lot is done to differentiate sub-areas of these areas, making these areas forgottable, and a lot of them blur together for me.\\n\\nThe music I think is fine. Some pieces are immensely immersive for the places they are put in (Subterranean Grave\\'s music tracks), and others are really dull single piano pieces with not a lot done with them. There\\'s a level of inconsistency that will become really apparent the further you get with the game. I don\\'t think this is harmful in any way, except for the final boss\\' theme which [spoiler]is like, a minute long over THREE phases and the final phase just speeds up the song. It\\'s also not a particuarly interesting track either, I would go as far as to say the instruments are mixed pretty poorly and compete with each-other, and makes the final boss even more of a snooze-fest.[/spoiler] Anywho! The music is pretty inoffensive, if unimpressive overall, unless you\\'re an audiophile such as myself.\\n\\nStory is something I\\'m not sure what was intended to be done. Attempts are made to flesh out characters a little and re-contextualise the kingdom, the queen and your pilgrimage, but- well, to put it simply it\\'s very forced yet basically nothing comes of it. Characters are incredibly one-note, and a lot of them exist solely for the purpose of getting an item or doing a boss fight. Serious attempts at a badass\\' epic boss fight of revenge and other cool stuff [spoiler]Pardoner Fennel just literally fights you based on an incorrect assumption that she delivers a big spiel about which you have to then kill her which unlocks an optional boss fight with her sister because you... were forced to kill the Pardoner Fennel because we gotta get that emotional tone in somehow![/spoiler] Anyway it was pretty trope-y and bland through and through, might have been better with just a simple premise explored through being immersed in the setting. I think I wouldn\\'t care as much about it if all of the promotional material for this game is about these nothing characters that do nothing and are nothing (looking at YOU Lubella, the big blue lady who is in every piece of promotional material for this gosh dang game even though she contributes just. Absolutely nothing to the game itself).\\n\\nNotice that I left something until last? Yeah, the gameplay! Unfortunately I think this is the weakest aspect of this game, which is a problem, being a sorta-souls-inspired metroidvania! There\\'s a serious lack of polish and thought in the way that the mechanics gel together, and I\\'ll do my best to cover the important ones and not be too spergy like my last review. This game is very much inspired by Dark Souls, featuring a VERY light combo system and a roll that provides a limited amount of invincibility frames, along with a ranged bow attack, and many passive and active items to utilise. I feel like that there\\'s a fundamental problem with this combat system; it\\'s two dimensional. With less space to work with, especially screen space, there\\'s less nuance that can be woven into the play experience, and it\\'s very apparent with attack patterns basically being shared between bosses. Your roll I feel is fine, it\\'s fast & responsive, but the combo on the ground is awfully slow and features a lot of end lag, making it difficult to react to oncoming attacks even through boss openings. This makes the bow and jumping attack much better options for actually beating the game, as you can be much more responsive and proactive with your movement.\\n\\nHowever I don\\'t feel like this style of play was intended, and it does cheapen the already simplified system somewhat. But you know what\\'s cheaper than that? Enemies having contact damage! Look, I get it. There has to be SOME way to prevent players from running through every enemy, but I don\\'t think this is a correct way to do it. It\\'s very difficult to tell when enemies do or don\\'t have contact damage (hitboxes are weird, are active on frame 1 when enemy recovers from hitstun), and makes it so that you want to distance yourself and NOT use your combo attack, as you might move into the enemy that will recover from stun and two/one hit you with contact damage if you were playing on Hard or the [spoiler]obligatory hardcore insane mode for epic gamers for a game that is unrefined because padding![/spoiler].  \\n\\nPassive and active items are pretty samey, and don\\'t change the gameplay too much. They\\'re pretty inoffensive and fun to obtain, but could easily been left out of the experience. I do like them though. \\n\\nThere is just. A decision that makes me audibly say \"oh right, this happens why, exactly?\" every time I am reminded that it exists is that any time you unlock a shortcut with a emerging/sinking wall you have to wait through the incedibly slow animation EVERY TIME YOU ENTER THE SCREEN. You\\'d think in a metroidvania you wouldn\\'t want to make the shortcuts painfully slow, or yknow, at least have the decency to even just change the room to an identical one but the wall is already up/down once you leave, and that\\'s the laziest option that you could do, but here we are. It irks me so much because it would be so easy to fix, yet takes up so much time.\\n\\nSo, yeah. My experience is not exactly what you\\'d call positive... but don\\'t be too deterred by me! It\\'s a decent game, but don\\'t expect a deep and enriching experience filled with an incredible story and compelling combat- like what the store page and a number of people would have you believe. But hey, I\\'m exaggerating too, so if you\\'re still compelled to try this game out and read through this shitty review, then I have a tip for you: use the bow a lot, use jumping attack a lot, and make sure to master the (probably?) unintended jumping roll, it helps against a few bosses, witches and a lot of platforming segments.\\n\\nI\\'d still look out for whatever game rdein works on next though if I were you, as there is a lot of potential here, even if a lot of it was missed.\\n\\nUh yea. Um. 2/5? Not sure who this game is supposed to appeal to as it\\'s not very good story-wise, not deep enough combat-wise and isn\\'t the most graphically gripping game out there right now. A shame, because I really like the Momodora series to be honest. it was decent enough and the price was right, i don\\'t regrest my time or money. Hm, the game didn\\'t wholly convince me. For a Metroidvania, it offers not enough variety and challenges. After four hours I\\'ve finished the title and am not motivated to search for the missed secrets, like I normally do in comparable games. The visuals and music are compelling, yes, but the primitive 0815 story and lackluster gameplay just don\\'t appeal to me. Don\\'t get me wrong, I had many fun moments as well, but they were just too rare to recommend this game. I would like to give this game more time to see if it is good or not, but it is damn near completely unplayable becaue the controls are just that bad.  As it stands in order to get the controls to feel about normal I have to re assign all of them, which then leaves the menu\\'s and inventory completely unusable unless I am simultaniously using both a game controller AND a keyboard.  One of the menus and one for the game itself. Kagome from Inuyasha goes to not-Anor Londo to commit regicide. Fun and fairly challenging, explore everywhere to get the true ending. Seeing all these positive reviews, I was expecting more, way more. Maybe games like Hollow Knight have set the bar too high for the metroidvania genre... Anyway, here is what I really dislike with this game:\\n\\n1) Lack of details. All the rooms/areas you enter look like they could have been generated by random using very few elements. If only the maps were random, I wouldn\\'t have complained (much), but this isn\\'t the case. None of the areas are\\nmemorable.\\n2) Imprecise controls. Cluncky character movement.\\n3) Boring mechanics, you have very few attacks and items, and most of them are completely useless (fillers...). \\n4) Boring enemies. Most of them are static with very predictible and repititive attacks.\\n5) The difficulty is artificial, it\\'s the result of the bad control mechanics and lack of flexibility rather than clever design.\\n6) Non-existant story (well, feel free to call the heap of garbage cliches written in half an hour a story if you want)\\n7) The graphics is the usual anime pixel art. Yaaay!\\n8) The music was probably written in half an hour, just like the story.\\n\\nWhat I loved about that game:\\n\\n1) It was short, very short.\\n\\nI got it for about 3 dollars and I\\'m not even sure it was worth it. Just finished my first play through and I very much enjoyed it. Took me just over 5 hours but I never 100% the game. Multiple endings, very Castlevania-esque in that you need to progress, find new item/abilities, backtrack, and repeat. Very much enjoyed this game (music, graphics, gameplay, and story are all well done).\\nhttps://youtu.be/j2G0iChPEGg I highly recommend Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight for metroidvania lovers who like challenges with high levels of difficulty. For those who like beautiful pixel graphics or retro style games, this game is also worth a try.\\n\\nFor players who are not familiar with this genre, you may need to be vigilant. Because of the difference between normal settings and easy mode where normal mode is difficult and easy mode is too easy. If you are not proficient in this genre and don\\'t want to touch easy mode, this game is definitely not fun for you. Yeah the tiddies are nice, but if you want to induce rage, play on Hard difficulty. underrated and under the radar Kinda DS-platformer-like. It\\'s okay. Graphics and sounds design are great. I really tried to like this game, but I can\\'t find any redeeming qualities - the combat is basic and not very satisfying, the platforming feels unresponsive, the story (at least as far as I played) seems non-existant... I love Metroidvania games, Hollow Knight is probably my favourite game of the last couple of years, but this just feels like a cheap knockoff.\\n\\nIt\\'s not very expensive, especially on sale, so maybe you can try it... But it was not worth my time. Decent metroidvania. Reverie under the Moonlight accomplishes everything it sets out to do. The pixel art and music, while not phenomenal, effectively evoke the tone of a dark, derelict, decadent city fallen under a curse. The levels, while reusing enemies a bit too often, change up the visual variety to make the adventure interesting. The story is pretty simple, but the game does a lot of establish a tangible atmosphere with what little characters it has. The game is paced pretty well. Starts linear. Splits into 4 areas able to be tackled in any order. Then confluences into 2 finals levels. The power-ups aren\\'t abundant, but they do add the moment to moment gameplay. Reverie manages to maintain a balance throughout the whole experience, never being too easy nor too difficult. I imagine this is because healing items are distributed via checkpoints and Kaho doesn\\'t significantly power up throughout the game from statistical perspective, but it is nice the game is never tedious nor agitating.  I particularly like how saves are made quicker by only needing to hit the checkpoint rather than operate a menu. This isn\\'t a legendary game that will serve as a template for future games in the genre, but it is a more than competently crafted game with next to no frustrations and a few high points. Highly recommended.\\n\\nAddendum: Steam says I have 15 minutes logged into the game ought to me playing it in offline mode. Strange glitch made me unable to play the game online. Momodora is about 4 to 5 hours long, which is fine considering its quality and price. Man this game got me really in his fangs. The music the story the art everything is just perfect! i have to say as a pixel game enthusiast i really enjoyed this game and i surly got a place one my favourite pixel games shelfe! i can tell you some... get off the rails or your will get hit by the feels train. Like Dark Souls but as a 2D platformer with cute girls.\\n\\n(Like Dark Souls, PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. It\\'s not very fun on a keyboard layout, in my opinion.) Simple and intuitive, each part of your travel gonna be one of the most exciting adventures, with awesome backgrounds, beautiful music and charismatic characters. Easy to play, difficult to master. How can people enjoy a platformer with unreasonable controls?\\nThe audio is really good but gameplay wise it\\'s a mess.\\nAt least I bought it during a sale... Unique game with gorgeous sprites, compelling souls-like narrative and superb music.\\n\\nChallenging but not infuriating, game gives you all the tools you need to clear it without struggling too much.\\n\\nIt really deserves your attention and it\\'s practically a steal at this price. I don\\'t know. It feels kind of mediocre. Controls pretty well and all, but the combat is just boring. And the dialogue is pretty cringy. Anime was a mistake. It was a lot of fun i really enjoyed playing it. Really fun and challenging Beautiful pixel art. \\nGreat soundtrack.\\nNormal difficulty feels like hard and easy feels like it shouldve been normal. \\nEnemies do a ton of damage and you\\'ll die fast and often (in normal difficulty). \\nBosses take a ton of hits to kill, even on easy. Maybe that\\'s why I got the bad ending because I played on easy? \\nFun metroidvania, although I liked momodora III better. Good metroidvania, focused on combat with good and open exploration. I very much enjoyed this game. It seemed very well-balanced, classy, casual, artful, enjoyable~ A lovely and all around great experience.\\nAddicting gamepley, nice story, pretty sprites. Really loved the mechanics. Yeah I mean okay sure yeah well maybe hm yeah\\n\\nIt\\'s alright. It\\'s solid. But that\\'s it. It\\'s really short as well.\\n\\nIt\\'s not much of a Metroidvania. More of just a straight action platformer.\\n\\nYou\\'ll probably like it if you liked Cave Story. I think. In full disclosure, I used to be the kind of person that would turn down a game the moment the word \"metroidvania\" was used to describe it. And boy, after playing Momodora do I regret doing that. \\nThis game plays very wonderfully, the control scheme is very confortable (keyboard that is), and I sinked 3 hours straight in a single sitting. \\nMusic is very good and pleasent, even though I died countless times and returned to many maps, I always muttered the songs as I heard them. \\nBoss encounters are well designed, not the most complex or amazing I\\'ve seen in side-scrollers, but well designed nevertheless. \\nAt moments I felt like reaching a bell in the game was the same as reaching a bonfire after a long time in Dark Souls. \\nThe ambient and artstyle are unique in a way. The map design felt really nice when I found my way around puzzles or unreachable places that were actually quite reachable. \\nAs a final note, you get to turn into a cat after a certain point in the game. And if that doesn\\'t convince you to by this game, nothing will. o: This game is drastically different from what I usually play (FPS/Simulators), but I\\'m glad I tried it out.\\n\\nThis game has a lot shooting for it: great artstyle, great music, smooth controls (I used an Xbone controller on PC), and good overall gameplay. Each of the bosses is unique with their own special movements, attacks, and evasions. They all also teach you how to combat specific moves, which the final boss tests you on *vigorously*.\\n\\nStory is kinda light, but only on a surface viewing. If you\\'re really paying attention, you\\'ll learn some really tragic stories and learn about the non-hostile NPCs and their motives for various actions. I suggest that you go check up on them as you progress through the game. \\n\\nI\\'m definitely going to be playing and replaying this game to find all the secrets and endings.\\n\\nDEFINITELY RECOMMEND for just about anyone, and especially for anyone into Metroidvanias or sidescrollers in general. A short yet very nice game with beautiful graphics and a somewhat eerie/somber atmosphere. Difficulty-wise, I think it\\'s moderate, leaning to easy, since the attack patterns of monsters & bosses are easy to learn and dodge once you figured them out. It\\'s a pleasing metroidvania for completionists and casual players that enjoy short & pretty-looking games. The style is consistent, and it\\'s great how the whole world map doesn\\'t feel linear; letting you discover new areas your own way. Shorter game, but great play. Got it for 2 bucks and its defintely the best 2 bucks ive ever spent. 6 Hours long, great fights and exploration. Check out all of the usable items for many different play styles. Metroidvania Dark souls esk title. it\\'s good, kinda hard but you\\'ll get use to it, just remember the enemy pattern Short and sweet. Fun boss fights with a good difficulty curve. Has a NG+ if you care for that, but once through was fine for me. porra jogo lindo vai se fude Challenging and fun platformer.\\n A good, short metroidvania. Very nice metriodvania pixel game, monsters and boss patrons are something \"easy\" but in insane diff makes you challenge,\\nanimations and graphics are well-made too\\nThe game forces you to repeat and travel back to complete the 100% and thats nice B)\\nTbh doesnt worth 10$ so catch it on sale A mix of new & old, beautifully done. Yaay! My new personal favourite. :D I don\\'t enjoy platformers that much but graphics and soundtrack made up for it. game is bloody fantastic its not the best but it certainly a great game\\nfor what you get this is really good.\\nfun and not too hard bosses \\nand easy to navigate with the map\\nalot of small secrets and pasage ways\\nand the chacater design quite nice with really nice sprite work\\njust a fun game and i really recommed this\\nthe only real problem i have is that the game is too short\\n I have reached 70% of the map right now!!I just wanted to say that this platform game is incredible,has great art and it is a bit difficult and thats what it makes me wanna play again and again till I will finish it.I recommend it to all platform gamers out there. Nice prequel of Momodora series. this game is simple and great honestly suprised at the overall quallity A great, simplistic metroidvania game. The combat is simple, but offers a decent challenge. The story\\'s pretty straightforward and unfortunately not particularly interesting. But the gameplay is very solid, and feels great. The music lends itself quite well to the feel of each zone and events that happen. Super enjoyable game, with a great difficulty curve. If you like to spend the time to really explore a map and find secret items, it\\'s phenomenal and you should definitely get it. Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale and definitely get it then. The game was ok, and I\\'m gonna give a relatively short summary why in a couple of categories.\\n\\nHype: Seeing all of the reviews praising this game and series, I had high hopes for what this game would deliver. All in all, I was kinda dissapointed. This is the first and only Momodora game i\\'ve played, and I am curious to see what the other games have to offer. I feel much of the acclaim for this game is from the diehard fans.\\n\\nLevel/Area Design: Being a metroidvania game, I expected this game to be full of twists and turns with a seemingly neverending feel to the levels. What I found was quite the opposite. Many of the areas are littered with empty and pointless rooms with decorative doors that go nowhere, and the same enemies appearing over and over again. As for the design of the rooms themselves, most were very basic and easily sprinted through with no trick to learn and no tough jumps. The most you\\'d get is a trap and a couple enemies, and some bouncy blocks frantically placed to connect rooms. I also felt that when backtracking having the enemies face the other way made the game too easy. \\nSpeaking of backtracking, there\\'s a lot of it. Again, I know it\\'s a metroidvania, but I often find myself running through entire areas (which are filled with dead ends that serve no purpose, not even a secret) just to find a key or a fragment. Much of the time I spent playing this game was devoted to moments like these.\\n\\nBosses/Enemies: The enemies in this game are charming and fairly creative, but many of them just feel rushed. Very few of them have a special sound effect or attacks that set them apart from each other, and after 1 fight you can easily kill them every time. The bossfights are fairly well thought out, although the bosses only had a couple of moves each and were either extremely predictable after 1 or 2 tries, or were intentionally made unfairly unpredictable to the point where I\\'m just rolling around and spamming my arrows.\\n\\nCombat: The combat in this game is satisfying and responsive, however it lacks diversity. Some might say not having different armour and weapons adds to the simplicity and the charm of this game, but the game doesn\\'t make up for it. You only get one weapon, the maple leaf, and it has a short and simple combo that gets old quick. This confused me because the Steam description says \"unleash ravaging combos\". I do give this game props though because it well reinforces the use of the ranged weapon. I often find in games that ranged weapons are normally only put there for very specific situations, or for people to mess around. The bow becomes your best friend for new enemies, and helps you out if you\\'re low on health. The rolling and air dodge air very responsive and fun to use, although I feel that it serves little purpose other than to kill bosses or run through rooms. I could go on for hours in this topic nitpicking everything, but it did fairly well for what it was aiming for.\\n\\nItems: The shops in this game are few and far between, with very little items to offer. It replicates the dark souls inventory setup, with passives (rings) and actives (potions/bellflowers etc.). Items are scarce, with the typical health items and a few unique ones just to fill the category. The currency is basically useless at a certain point and can thankfully be replaced by the ring that regenerates health instead of dropping money. I specifically dislike the ring that tells you where secrets are, as I personally find that finding secrets on your own is more rewarding.\\n\\nMusic/Sounds: Although the music is charming, I see little reason to give it more acclaim than most other games. Given the recent beautiful soundtracks in not only other games but even other pixely/metroidvania games, the soundtrack doesn\\'t even come close to living up to the hype. The music in areas in very 1-dimensional, and usually doesn\\'t serve to the atmosphere of the area at all other than being sad or menacing. As for the sounds effects, they were my least favourite part of the game. I already spoke on the monsters\\' sound effects, but right from the start of the game it feels as though there\\'s those extra sounds missing that would make the game so much more immersive. All in all, there are very minimal sounds with just enough to get by. The hurt and death sound particularly irk me, as they sound very out of place (that death sound kills me inside a lil bit every time).\\n\\nStory: To be frank, the story is pretty lackluster. I\\'m not going to spoil it, but I felt almost no connection to what was happening in the story nor did I care for any of the characters. The almost entirely female cast was specially designed for those guys who always pick the girl in games (yes this includes me), but most characters are pretty basic looking aside from the fairly unique main villain.\\n\\nMechanics: Many of the mechanics in this game were introduced much too late, and don\\'t really think outside the box as far as metroidvanias go. There were plenty of them, but I rarely found a use for them other than to make the game a little easier.\\n\\nLength: Although length really doesn\\'t matter, I feel this game ended much too quickly. Again, many of the mechanics really led up to nothing, and once I found myself mastering them the game was already over. I beat this game in around 2 hours (much shorter than most of the reviews), most likely because I started sprinting through rooms after I realized they had little to offer. \\n\\nTL;DR: I didn\\'t hate the game, but it could\\'ve used some polish and definitely doesn\\'t suit the \"overwhemingly positive\" rating. I could\\'ve given more praise in many of the categories, but I chose not to because all of the other reviews have already done it. Although I hate comparing games to Dark Souls, this game tries really hard be like it, and that\\'s not what I came for. This game should be considered \"an introduction to metroidvanias\". Cute and fun metriodvania style pixel game. I think that I\\'m about half way through the game as of writing this review - the whole game will probably take about 6 hours to finish but longer if you want to 100%. I would HIGHLY reccomend using a gamepad! I\\'m not good at this game. It took me multiple tries to defeat bosses, but I cheesed it on Medium anyhow. I\\'m not even finished with the game yet, still need to defeat the final one I think. Despite all that, I can definitely say this game is a HOT one. Even if I can\\'t finish it, I\\'ll replay the parts that I can finish. Beautiful graphics and music complement each other really well. Combat is simple and easy to learn for the most part, and ranged attacks are a failsafe if you can\\'t melee well. I\\'ve never played a metroidvania before, but I am a lover of collection games (animal crossing, minecraft, ect.) and there are tons of secret spots and items to find in this game. If it were longer, I\\'d say the price would be entirely worth it. In view of that, however, it\\'s a short but impactful experience that may or may not be worth it to you. Replayability is also subjective; you can replay to get better and grind those achievements, or you can replay to find all the secrets and get a 100% completion. Or both. Runs on most machines, trash laptops included, and is just stellar. If you\\'ve got a spare ten, you should definitely put it down here. Wow. Just wow.\\nThe lastest (fourth) installment in the Momodora series is exactly what you would expect: the coming together of all that was great about the previous games: a big map, varied enemies, massive bosses, a range of power-ups, a mysterious hinted at story and it\\'s all so pretty. The soundtrack is, as always, an integral part of the experience and it doesn\\'t disappoint.\\n\\nThe first thing that jumps out at you, most likely, is how pretty this game is. It\\'s really impressive, rdein really outdid himself this time. Luckily, graphics isn\\'t the only thing that\\'s good about this game. As usual, it\\'s a game that sucks you in with its gameplay, hunt for power-ups and secrets, exploration and challenging difficulty.\\n\\nAs usual, too, it\\'s really light story-wise; most of the events, locations, character backstories etc are only ever hinted it. It could be so much more than it is, but one should keep in mind that it\\'s made by a very small team. Still, what is a really good game could\\'ve been god-tier had it only been slightly more fleshed it in a few areas. And yet again, as always, its biggest weakness is its length.. you\\'re left wanting more.\\n\\nIt\\'s the best Momodora to date. It\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s so damn good. I really can\\'t wait for the next installation.\\nIn brief:\\n\\nGraphics 10/10\\nMusic 9/10\\nDifficulty 8/10\\nStory 5/10\\nContinuity ??/10 ;)\\n\\nIn my opinion, one of the best metroid/castlevanias-(but only SOTN, amirite?)-likes out there. It\\'s fun, it\\'s beautiful, it\\'s sad, it\\'s hard, it\\'s addictive - it looks and sounds and plays great! It\\'s a great game, no doubt about. Worth your money, more so than most other games out there. Buy it Bosses obliterate me. I constantly die. It builds character. A beautiful, handcrafted game with so much love put into it. Very fun a quite additive. Would recommend. As a completionist, I loved this game. Not too long, so multiple playthroughs for 100% isn\\'t a chore. And I was able to master the mechanics enough that no-hit bosses (essentially required for one of the achievements) was doable, even though it seemed daunted on the first playthrough. klassik\\n The game is fun enough if you like this genre of game, but it isn\\'t particularly great in any way. The trailer makes it look a lot better than it is. The storyline is probably one of the blandest ever: The evil queen has corrupted the land--fetch 4 magic items which will let you defeat her. Along the way, you will meet NPCs which are basically stationary signposts with a couple lines of dialog of absolutely no importance. Most NES games have more interesting characters. OK, so you don\\'t play the game for the story--how about the gameplay?\\n\\nThe game has an odd difficulty curve where it starts out very challenging for the first few areas but suddenly becomes too easy for the rest of the game. The later enemies have easier patterns than the early ones but you become more powerful. Bosses like to stand around while you pelt them to death with arrows. It\\'s almost like they weren\\'t designed to deal with ranged attackers. The balance is wonky where some attacks will take off half your life (on medium) and some will barely scratch you, which will give you i-frames and allow you to avoid the heavy attacks. The enemy patterns are fairly simple, with the bosses only having a few patterns each.\\n\\nI\\'m not a big fan of autocombos where pressing the attack button multiple times in succession causes you to move forward and get locked into a slow animation. This kind of behavior has its place in a brawler, but I don\\'t like the stiff feel it brings to a platform game. At least you can roll cancel out of the attack.\\n\\nThis game is outclassed by games like Guacamelee and Dust which have better gameplay, better graphics and music, much better stories, and more content. Short but sweet. What really stood out was the soundtrack. The dev team may have a gem of a composer admist them. it ameaze me how perfect it deliver the story whitout treating the gameplay as a second dish, it gets a little hard at the begining but you get the hang of it pretty quickly Yeah. Reminds me of cave story. Great little platformer. Totally worth the sale price, for me. Pros: Beautiful game in general(sounds, graphics and more). Challenging without being frustrating and, for hardscore players, it has the replay factor!\\nNeutrals: Story, the variability of the game(enemies, stages, movements), and the price.\\nCons: Annoying death scene. Every time you die, you have to hear an annoying sound.\\n\\nI recommend this game! nice Way too short. Nice but generic. Not worth 10$.\\n\\nBasically no replay value, just a few achievement related things to go back and collect. Nice atmosphere and art style. A few cool mechanics but sadly they don\\'t do anything at all with them. Combat is generic and uninspired.\\n\\nNothing about this game is notably \"bad,\" there\\'s just nothing notably good either. If it goes on sale for under $5 then what the hell, buy it, it\\'s more intereting than starbucks coffee. it can get pretty short and if you\\'re good at metroidvanias, the game isn\\'t really that hard. almost all the attacks are really telegraphed and easy to dodge, but it can still give newcomers of metroidvania games a pretty hard time. anyways, it\\'s still really fun and the art is sooo good and the same with the ost. it\\'s worth the full price imo really Very. Nice.\\nThere was one decision where you could fight the bird below, go in the mansion to the right or go up top.\\nDon\\'t go to the birb first. This game is amazing! The graphics are beautiful, a good combination of classic pixel graphic style with modern color pallette, kinda feels like Cave Story-ish graphics but better. The gameplay is charming, the combats are well implemented, and the characters are cute along with interesting story. Like other metroidvania games, it has focus on explorations, and you always get rewarded with something every time you explore around. The musics are nice, but sounds a bit bland compared to other similar games, while some other levels are using ambient sounds.\\nOne thing to note is that this game is hard and takes no mercy. Even on medium, you can\\'t always beat the bossess for less than 4 tries. And the attacks are unfair, sometimes you take damage from enemies for more than HALF of your health bar, and there are enemies that\\'s impossible to reach, making navigation difficult as you have to dodge enemy attacks along with obstacles along your way. Some people compared this game is almost difficult as Dark Souls (which if you don\\'t know it\\'s the standard of very difficult games), and I do think so too.\\nOverall, this game is great. 10/10. I got this game on sale, but I think it\\'s worth the original price. Buy it! Game is nice, love the pixel art, but they forgot to add the HARD to play on the tags, DAAANG everything kills you, you will be walking in a place that looks like castlevanias library room and you die all of a sudden.\\n\\nCasting spells leaves you vulnerable and ofc there is no time of invincibility when you get hit once, so if someone hits you twice from full health down to 0.\\n\\nAGAIN game is good, but DAAAng is hard. This is an absolutley fantastic game for anyone who is fans of the Dark Souls franchise, this games is challenging and the art is just as good as it should be. Music, artstyle and gameplay is fine. Combat however is not. Does combat being not great ruin the fun? Not really. Game is really fun and world is really enjoyable to explore. Kinda like Hollow Knight, exploration is fun but combat is meh.\\n\\nYour character can gain rewards if you kill the bosses \\'\\'while not taking damage\\'\\' from them. These rewards can make the game too easy but you can ignore them if you want a challenge. \\n\\nThese doesnt matter that much but the dev clearly loves the Dark Souls series and there is a NG+ if you are curious. Good fun game, a little on the short side but very replayable and easily worth the $15. I\\'d love to see a sequel to this, or an expansion DLC, I feel mechanics lead themselves to a much higher skill ceiling.\\n\\nEdit: Oh, and the graphics, music and SFX are all extremely well done. I really liked this game, if you think about buying it, just go for it. Everything with a CPU in it will be powerfull enought to run this game xD. A fun plattformer, with a little bit of story, and cool fighting mechanics. I would definitly buy this game again. \\n:rghost::momoshroom::blissful_creep: It\\'s the first time iv\\'e played a metroidvania genre and at first i thought its gonna be a pretty bad game because im not Familiar with this kinds of genres. At first, you play this awesome girl (she\\'s a priestess) who has a frekin maple leaf as a weapon of choice and her trusty bow for those long range users out there.\\nShe\\'s trying to save her village from being corrupted and ask for the queen\\'s aid.\\nAnd uhmm i would definitely play the 3rd chapter of this game because they\\'re actually 4 chapters of this game.\\nI would rate it 7.5/10 would play it again and again. It\\'s not bad, but the game is just bland and forgettable. Great game. It was challenging but not overly difficult. I\\'d die and have to start from last save and sometimes that meant a lot of work lost but once you get used to it, you know where to run to save after you\\'ve done a bit. I just recently beat Limbo and this game was so much better than that. (I honestly don\\'t know why everyone LOVES Limbo. It was rather boring and didn\\'t have any story besides what the devs told ppl) This game on the other hand gives you a story that you see through to the end. You get items that can help you in combat and different abilities that also help. It\\'s mostly a platformer with a decent amount of combat. Pretty, but difficult to enjoy. \\n\\nWhile the art, environments and sounds are enjoyable to experience, this game\\'s mechanics were little more than frustrating through most of my time playing. It\\'s impossible not to make a comparison to Dark Souls here, as Momodora has borrowed several pages from the book of souls design. Sadly, it doesn\\'t translate well into a 2d environment. \\n\\nThis game wants you to die. Repeatedly. Most enemies are faster than you, deal around a third of your health in damage per hit, and the game will frequently spawn enemies behind you, or right on top of you. It also suffers from what I like to call \"Not-dodging,\" providing the character with a dodge roll that fails to dodge much of anything. \\n\\nThe ability to defend yourself is very inconsistent. Some enemy bullets can be bounced back, but it\\'s never clear which can and which can\\'t. Enemies and some bosses deal contact damage, as well as damage you with their attacks, meaning a successful dodge usually gets you hit by the boss\\' most devastating ability: Jumping forward to touch you. \\n\\nThe main character also has a jarring and obnoxious scream on every death, further punctuating the frustration of playing through the same section of a level yet again. \\n\\nVery little of the game\\'s mechanics are explained in any form. Items in shops lack descriptions, leaving you with no idea what you\\'re actually buying until you buy it. Would that item be useful? You have no idea! Can that bullet be destroyed with an attack? Who knows? You\\'ll have to try in order to find out, likely dying in the process and being sent back to your last checkpoint to play that same section of the level all over again.\\n\\nThe worst example I can think of was right after the first large boss. Once the boss is down, you have two directions to move in; one has the next save point, the other is an empty area with a death pit that would seem to invite the player to jump in to explore further. Should you do so; you\\'re instantly killed and sent back to replay the entire jaunt leading up to the boss all over again. Game seems to always be looking for excuses to kill the player and pad it\\'s playtime with repeated trips through the same area. \\n\\nDefinitely not my idea of a good time. Will be refunding it. >1st time playing the game\\n>choose \"HARD\" difficulty\\n>get beaten by the poison thing in the beginning\\n>stuck in the beginning for 20 minutes\\n>getting used to it\\n>proceed to the 1st boss\\n>stuck again for 20 minutes\\n>proceed to the next stage\\n>get killed by the witch 50 times\\n>good game Short, sweet, and well polished. The game is 4, maybe 5 hours start to finish if you are not in a hurry. If you can get it on sale, do so. Best game I played this year, highly recommended. It is what I wanted from hollow knight, but this was way more fun. Good that there is difficulty settings, so anyone can play it. Short but sweet the pc controlls are really bad and you can\\'t remap them... I don\\'t understand all the positivity regarding this game. I played it with a friend of mine for about 45 minutes and the controls were just so laggy. The character doesn\\'t respond quick enough for you to make a snap decision. There\\'s not enough mobility to the character and the character feels too heavy and the controls are not tight.  The hot boxes are impossible to Grasp. It\\'s a lot of little things but it adds up to me never playing this again. I suddenly have to fight a waifu boss by hitting her breast with my leaf.\\n\\n10/10 would whack them tities Great game & a fantastic art style I really like the autmosphere and enviorment of this game. This game is great graphice and music that work well with the autmospher this game trying to create. It does challange you like that \"titts boss\" she was rough beat me couple of time. The thing I like about this game that they are beatable for someone like me who don\\'t play the game very often, unlike some other game where I will pull my hair off \"*cough* hollow knight* *cough* I like that feature of this game. Thanks for making this game affordable and creating it for us to enjoy. Would look forward to your future game.\\n\\nI FINISHED THIS GAME FOR FIRST TIME IN 11 HOUR XD\\n\\n10/10 would recommend this game\\n\\nps: I love hollow knight but boy boss fight makes me hollow. Great metroidvania. Really enjoyed the music and the art style. The pixels look so good!\\n\\nThe difficulty was just right. Save points are placed just where you know they are.\\n\\nThe characters and the protagonist are awesome. I love playing as her.\\n\\nFor 5 hours I enjoyed nearly every second of it. If you\\'re a fan of retro style Sidescroller/Metroidvania games this is Definitely worth a buy.\\n\\nA bit of a fair warning, It has a bit of that Dark Souls style difficulty to it so you may need a bit of patience with dieing/running through from last save, and figuring out where you need to go. Though I only played this on hard, and It does have an easy mode which I haven\\'t touched, which may be good for the casual gameplay. Super solid Metroidvania game with charming graphics, cute designs, and a really cool world? Not the hardest thing you\\'ll ever play but will give a decent challenge, especially if you wanna go achievement hunting. Underrated fave and I\\'d die for the cat witch tbh I bough it on a sale and I didn\\'t expect it to be [u]THAT[/u] good, and it turned out to be great! \\nIt\\'s a metroidvania with some Dark Souls elements (mostly the Souls part). I didn\\'t play the previous games so I don\\'t really know how much it improves in comparison with the rest)\\nNice and cute pixel art graphics. It\\'s a lil hard but it\\'s easy to get the hang of it.  Also the level design is great\\n\\nA controller is [b]highly recommended.[/b]  (Keyboard sucks ass in this game so a controller is a MUST) It\\'s like the illegitimate child of Super Metroid and Darksouls/Bloodborne.\\n\\nIf you like either of those series you may enjoy this.\\n\\nIf you dislike either of those series you may want to pass. Fantastic game, amazing art style, tight control scheme and great story. This was my intro to Momodora as a whole and I beat it in 2 days because I played it so much! Definitely worth your time if you like metroidvanias and a little bit of challenge *Compitent and mechanically sound. Otherwise, an incredibly short game with little replay value* \\n\\nOn a substantial sale, in my case $2, it is worth the money, outside of that I couldn\\'t recommend it due to its incredibly short length. \\n\\nFirst run-through was sub 5 hours and it was a 100% completion run. That time even includes periods where the game was just paused and I was away, not playing. With a dedicated, focused, effort it would be possible to 100% this game in a few hours, at most.\\n\\nIs it on sale for a couple of dollars? \\nDo you have a handful of hours you want to kill? \\n\\nThis is one way of doing it. spent few mins and Im already fall in love with this game.\\nit has:-\\n[list]\\n[*]cute characters.\\n[*]good visuals(cause I love pixel games) and awesome gameplay.\\n[*]pleasant soundtracks.\\n[*]a big tiddy boss. xD\\n[*]dark souls vibes.\\n[/list]\\nworth every cent!\\nPS:use a controller or git gud :3 Nice game!\\n9/10 Dark Souls was easier. new dark souls good Buy it . I expected nothing and I was amazed (I\\'ve got it for 2 $) Instead of a full review, let me hit its main facets so you can decide whether to buy Momodora:RutM:\\n\\n1. It \"is\" a real metroidvania (sidescrolling item hunt), but it is a short one. When you know what you\\'re doing, you can complete the game in three hours or less, but there is some secret item/passage hunting for more diversion. Plenty of save points in the right places. If you get the bad ending, you can get the good ending with a little work.\\n\\n2. There are three difficulty levels, with an easy casual mode, a normal, and a hard mode, which affects health you have and damage you deal (and starting items). Your character has a very short-range melee (leaf) and long range (bow), all of which can be augmented in multiple ways by items--but you can only equip two at once.\\n\\n3. The music and artstyle really delivers a tone of loneliness and mild spookiness, with cuteness that does not veer into humor.\\n\\nYou might pass on this game at full price, only because it is short. But don\\'t pass on it if platformers are usually too hard for you; this one isn\\'t tough on the easiest mode, and is plenty challenging at the hardest. vry gud Score: 7.5\\n\\nSolid and short metroidvania. The beginning of this game is a lil hard, like the first ten minutes or so but after a while you get a lil bit more used to the playstyle and you\\'ll get some powerup that makes things a little easier. If you a metroidvania fan its a must cop especially if it on sale. There\\'s also an impressive speedrun of this game that you can look up on youtube. Save points are few and far-between, and you lose all your progress if you die in the meantime. It throws a lot at you pretty early, and the dodge roll takes serious accuracy or you\\'ll get hit anyways. It\\'s a nice game on the front of it, but one bad surprise can undo a lot of unsaved progress. On top of that, there\\'s not much variety in attacking and attacks lock you into animation frames, which can leave you vulnerable mid-attack when you need to evade. I got this cheap on sale and I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay more. Anytime it\\'s mentioned I have to re-install it. tasty Awelsome metroidvania.\\nIt got me really into the series after playing Momodora: RUtM.\\nJust the right dificulty. The game\\'s really solid, and my only gripe is that it\\'s too short.\\n(Beat the game on normal in under 5 hours.)\\n\\nI actually found the controls pretty tight and don\\'t understand the few complaints I\\'ve seen regarding them.\\nThe combat has little variety, but feels fluid and satisfying.  This probably wouldn\\'t be true if the game were much longer, but since it\\'s short the mechanics never grew stale for me.  Small, incremental upgrades keep you feeling strong as the game progresses. \\n\\nNot much going as far as replay value goes, but if you can catch it on sale, it\\'s a steal.\\n(Currently $2 on sale, wtf, just grab it.) PROS:\\n- Beautiful art style\\n- Entrancing lore\\n- Very well balanced game\\n\\nCONS:\\n- Not much going for long-term replayablity 10/10 First game I (33) have enjoyed so entirely in many years. An awesome metroidvania with fun combat and exploration and a nice soundtrack. HUGE timekiller.. i like Really not fun. I get that it\\'s supposed to be difficult, but the difficulty lies more in clunky controls and bad design than anything else. If the base mechanics of a platformer are not fun, it\\'s pretty much safe to say the game won\\'t be fun. They deliberately made the movement and combat sluggish to replicate a dark souls sort of playstyle, and that is just extremely unenjoyable in a platformer, a genre where you usually want quick and tight controls.\\n\\nAt the VERY least, there should be much better controller suppoer (read: rebindable buttons) Very fun metroidvania. Very sizable world with plenty of exploring to do. Once you have passed the first boss fight, the order and method that you collect items and explore the land is completely up to you. Combat however simple provides a fun challenge of learning enemy patterns and attacking during openings, similar to dark souls. For goodness sake get this game. NOW!\\nbecause it\\'s ; \\n\\n1.) Kawaii\\n2.) Sugoi\\n3.) And\\n4.) Kimochii I wanted to try this game out since it looked cool, but the controls are terrible for keyboard. I even tried using a Ps4 controller but that didn\\'t even work. If they ever fix the controls I would be willing to give this game another shot. overrated\\n\\nedit: look at those triggered fanbois on my profile comments LOL Adorable, but kinda hard. I enjoyed it. good game. very nice. yes. Wow, just wow. I fully support and love this game to no end it is amazing. the bosses are insane and i love it It is ok. I dont recommend playing on \"Hard\" on the first try, since a lot of attacks are one hit kill, even with health upgrades. A metroidvania platformer with nice pixel art. It\\'s not a long game, but it has a simple and elegant feel that I\\'d recommend to anyone who likes the genre. Gameplay: 9/10\\nGraphics: 9/10\\nStory: 8/10\\nSound: 9/10\\nMusic: 8/10\\nReplay Value: 8/10\\nValue for Money: 8.5/10\\n\\nOverall Rating: 9/10 After fully completing this with every achievement, mode, and finishing without dying... I still love this game to bits, even though it is highly difficult. If youre not shy to challenge yourself playing games like this, definitely give it a try and give a shot to the no-deaths run on insane mode. A cute and unpretentious platformer with pretty art and music. The game is short and fairly easy but a pleasant experience nonetheless. Likeable bosses and story. I wish the cat form would\\'ve been implemented earlier and deepened as game mechanic, for it provided some due variety and additional cuteness. good game, will always have a special place in my heart Momodora Reverie Under The Moonlight is a Metroidvania without that Roguelike that seems to be trickling into these indie titles of late.  It takes a lot of the classic tropes and puts a modern spin on it with fluid combat and even comes complete with a decent storyline(even though it is rather bare bones).  Overall, I think this title may have flew under the radar of people that have since fallen in love with games like Hollow Knight.  So, if you are looking for something to feel that sweet spot and get some decent platforming in at a very affordable price, Momodora will be sure to please.\\n  \\nFor those Interested in my full review :\\nhttps://youtu.be/9l-SwaOEmNA \\n kinda boring, not really fleshed-out platformer darksoulsy kind of game Good game lads Very fun, allbeit a little short. Plenty of optional challenges in terms of difficulty, though the main game itself was a little easy. Lovely little metroidvania game with a great atmosphere. Exploring is very fun and the boss fights are great.\\n\\nIt has a good amount of story and depth for the fact that it is quite short, though I think a fair amount of play time can be added if you hunt out 100% of the secrets which I\\'ve yet to do. . Zombie tits. That\\'s all I have to say. With a dark fantasy atmosphere, a small cast of mysterious friendly characters and hints of the true nature of the various antagonists, the game certainly evokes the same kind of storytelling methods of the Souls games. Combined with very tight, reactive controls and fluid combat mechanics, the game manages to stand on it\\'s own as a lovely little Metroidvania while doing it\\'s own original and well-executed take on what made Dark Souls both mechanically and narratively excellent.\\n\\nI\\'d really highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of the genre and are looking for a short (~6 hours) game experience. It\\'s easily one of my favorite games I\\'ve played in recent memory and certainly left a great impression on me. I really loved this game. The pixal art and subtle but dark story combined with it\\'s really pretty sound track (which i bought) were beautiful. The gameplay, even though slightly repetive didn\\'t feel boring and boss fights were usually quite challenging but not so much so to frusterate me and if you\\'re good at these types of games the challenge comes from never getting hit ;P. I do reccomend this game to metrovania lovers! It\\'s lacking in some parts, great in others. Momodora: RUTM feelt like a more boring and shorter version of Hollow knight. Otherwise, decently good and made me excited enough to finish the game. Would, however, not have played or bought this game again. I personally am dissapointed because i expected a lot more from this game looking at the reviews.\\n\\n\\nA few notable annoying things in the game:\\n-Long waiting and traveling times. (There are 2 boss fights where you are interupted for 20 seconds because you have to watch some magical flying balls moving slowly accross the screen, and this happens several times during the same fight)\\n \\n-Can\\'t interupt roll or attacks. (stunlocks yourself. This can lead to moments like \"I pressed roll why didn\\'t she roll??!\" because you might be spaming attack)\\n\\n-Ugly and confusing minimap. Minimap doesn\\'t even tell the name of the places.\\n\\n-Boring bosses, most of them aren\\'t memorable. Some of them are however!\\n\\n-Don\\'t feel connected to the story.\\n\\n-REALLY imposible to find secrets. I had to look up a guide to find the last few hidden inside walls. My hat to you if you can find them without looking up a guide yourself!\\n\\n-Short game.\\n\\n-Kinda weird controlls at times. I\\'m using keyboard, but other mtroidvania and platformers have worked without problems using keyboard.\\n\\n\\nBut, if these point were fixed, Momodora:RUTM cold\\'ve become one of my favorite games! real fun platformer, found it to be addicting enough to complete the game without getting hit by the bosses imediately after beating the first boss, would do again 10/10 Let\\'s start with the obvious, the graphics are nice the caracters and backgrounds are all well done and nicely animated.\\nThe sound effects and music are just as good though it doesn\\'t have a lot of the latter.There\\'s only a few tracks, other than that there are some ambient sounds that really brings the stages to life.\\nThe game could be pretty challenging at times even on normal, not to mention the other difficulties.\\nOn the other hand the controls are really fluid and responsive and all the enemies and bosses have recognizable patterns. when you die it really feels like it\\'s on your own account.\\nThe story is a bit dark but it doesn\\'t try to be overwhelming. It\\'s told via short texts often spoken between characters.\\nAs for the ending, it was little disappointing for me but it feels like it gave a chance for a potential sequel.\\nThe game time isn\\'t much (I finished the game 4 times in 13 hour) but enjoyed playing the game from start to finish.\\n Nice metroidvania with some Souls mechanics, like the bells/bonfires, estus/leafs and so on. Its quite easy on normal but it has other difficulties, it has a nice world that is a blast to explore, fun bossfigths and little criptic NPCs. \\n\\nIts a little short (3-5 hours on your first playthrough), but it has different endings and a decent replay value, overall its really fun. \\n\\n[b] Recommended at full price\\t[/b] Does not have full controller support, which makes it difficult to play. That aside, great music and visuals, pretty enjoyable. You can turn into a cat and fight a nun. WITH A LEAF. You can also upgrade your leaf to make it a better leaf. somehow. This is some true Metroidvania!  Cute anime-girl with some bizarro weapon traversing puzzles and a variety of baddies along the way.  Delicious!\\nThe story is oddly compelling for a narrative that is basically carried through one-sides conversation and subtext.  There is at least enough there to understand what\\'s at stake and why our silent anime-girl is on this quest.  \\n\\nOn the downside, I do wish they would have added a few things to the structure of the game.  For some reason the process of developing your character felt too simplified.  If you remember Ocarina of Time then you remember how you felt at the end of the game as compared to the start.  You began with nothing and by the end you are wielding these almost god-like powers, freely teleporting and controlling the weather, etc.  Don\\'t expect that here.  You do get a lot of new stuff here and there, but in the end you still just feel like a little girl swinging around a magic leaf.\\n\\nDon\\'t be discouraged however, it\\'s definitely recommended to any fans of the genre.  Go check it out!\\n8.5/10 Loved this game, combat feels tight and rewarding. More depth then you might think. Pretty short, which is a plus for me. Difficulty feels just right, had to retry most bosses a few times. Graphics are very good, I liked the atmosphere. From what i can see the art style is gorgeous and the music is decent but.. THE CONTROLS it is so awkward and hard to learn and they cant even be rebound... buy it if youre fine with that but if you dont want an awkward and *unnecesarily* difficult experience then dont Not only is the gameplay really solid, but the athmosphere too. I really love the general gothic-esque mood both the visuals and story have without feeling too shoehorned, and the music is simple but very fitting the tone of the game. I\\'ve found myself listening to it in a loop many times already.\\n\\nI think my only \"complain\" is that I really wished the game was longer... Smooth animation and fun to play, challenging at time Very expert game has cat sphere. 10/10 goty Really cool metroidvania game with a good story and likable characters. \\nThe combat system rewards skill and timing, so you have to time jumps, dodging, hits and ranged attacks. The learning curve for mastering these abilities is very well done.\\nThe boss fights can be challenging, especially on the higher difficulties, but that makes it even more satisfying to beat a boss.\\nArt style is really beautiful and the characters in the game are very unique. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it\\'s too short.\\nSome hitboxes are weird, but consistent!\\nOutside of that awesome game. A bit short, but very heartwarming and beautiful. Cats and cute girls in a cute version of Dark Souls. absolutly stunning Overall a very fun game with great artwork. I\\'m a huge fan of it\\'s character design. Great game. Probably the best one in the entire series. This game has some of the best music and sprite animation that I have ever seen! Definitely worth playing! This is a fun little game with a surprising amount of replayability.\\nWhen you first start it, you die a lot, but you soon learn to move past that and push through till the end.\\nAnd with such a rich enviroment and beautiful art, this game certainly earns its charm as a good Metroidvania, with just a touch of Dark Souls and Bloodborne. A short but very enjoyable gem that is well worth getting when it\\'s on sale. Highly recommended! looks great \\nplays great\\ngreat game this game is great, give them your money A stellar Metroidvania. While more difficult than the average game of today, it\\'s still a bit on the easy side compared to the likes of Hollow Knight or Samus Returns. If you\\'re a Metroidvania veteran looking for a real challenge, I\\'d suggest turning up the difficulty.\\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone with an interet in the genre, as I personally feel that it\\'s one of the better ones. A pleasant and absolutly amazing game that was defintiely worth the time of playing.\\n\\nThe world building is drawn from both the various and wonderfully crafted enviroments and the NPCs you\\'ll meet through out. Every detail certainly earns the time to observe and admire. Exploring the map is a must for good reason. \\nThe soundtrack is beautifully used throughout the journey, and really adds to the experience. (I\\'d purchase the OST, if I had the money to spare)\\nCombat is fluid and can give a rather welcome challenge at times.\\nThe story is well written and is presented flawlessly throughout. (Its worth diving back in after one playthrough for hidden collectibles, Steam achivements, etc.)\\n\\nIt\\'s worth it to pick this one up whenever you can. It\\'s decently priced, though it\\'s a total steal when on sale. \\nI was pleased by it and I believe you would be too. Just finished the game. It has replayability and reminds me of the day I played Symphony of the Night for the first time. Although it has a smaller map, inventory, and enemies compared to SotN it can steal away your hours especially when you have a deadline coming up. fun stuff with nice visuals Amazing metroidvania, not easy but you can get the hang of it pretty quickly. Visuals are cool and the story is very interesting. Also it\\'s relatively short but it has some extra challenges and replayability. It\\'s a dorable it\\'s a blast it\\'s a game better played with a control pad. I\\'m glad that I got to play this game, because I like exploring cutesy environments and battling cutesy enemies that aren\\'t so cutesy as to not be able to get under your skin the little twerps. It\\'s maybe a bit laid back in the pacing department - metroidvania games are driven by the constant sense of new discovery - but it\\'s so pleasant to play, you might not mind. It\\'s cute, it\\'s creepy, it\\'s fun.\\n\\nYep, buy it. A fun game. It\\'s a really good game. 9/10 A lot of fun to speedrun! This game is incredible. The gameplay is fun as hell, and the audio and visuals come together to create an amazing aesthetic Really good game so far, I\\'ll update it once I finish, but I\\'m really liking it so far. While it doesn\\'t revolutionize the Metroidvania genre, [i]Momodora : Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] is a greatly enjoyable experience thanks to its gorgeous pixel art, its smartly-crafted level design and its responsive controls.\\n\\nIt is pretty short (about 5 hours long) : I\\'d say the game doesn\\'t overstay its welcome nor waste your time which is actually a good feature, but you might find it underwhelming if you go in there expecting a 15~20 hours game. I like this game, the pixel art is appealing, controls are responsive, and it provided a decent challenge and replayability to get through the game with a smaller hp bar. My first playthrough was on hard, which meant it was pretty easy to die from specific attacks, but if you enjoy the challenge, go for it, and after you clear that, you unlock insane difficulty where it seems like it\\'s one hit and you\\'re down, which may not be something for me but it\\'s nice to have the option if I\\'m feeling insane on day. I spent an hour with this game, and all I saw is a dull, unappealing, ugly by-the-numbers \"metroidvania\" with a weak main character and lots of irrelevant cutscenes and dialogue. They say it gets interesting later, but I expect games to be interesting from the start. Apparently, that\\'s really unhip and fun is overrated. I\\'ll reserve this game for when I have a really good day and need to remind myself that life is sad. A fun Castlevania/Metorid knock off in pixel format.  Story isn\\'t strong but the game play is pretty decent.  It\\'s a decent difficult game and most of the save points are pretty close to bosses (though spread out in regular areas).  It\\'s not very long and only 6 hours in length give or take.  Though the \"true ending\" which I didn\\'t know about at the time, is about getting your best weapon.  I got that ending simply because I like to explore everything as possible.   It\\'s pretty vague on that aspect.  But if you\\'re looking to kill a few hours and have a nostaglic feel to Cvania (since Konmai hasn\\'t produced anything GOOD lately), give this game a whirl.  It was overall fun! This is a very valid side scroller with a great challenge that awaits you at almost any point Good game to casually venture through and later on master if you feel inclined to do so. I played it on easy first to get used to it and the controls are great; animations are clean and the story is simple but effective. I enjoyed it I like a lot of things about this game but my favorite is how the developer thinks. Early on he gives you a charm that will let you earn more money. He replied to a thread I made about something unimportant, even though this game is 2.5 years old.  The way he chose to do the difficulty was better than most games\\' these days. He adds enemies and lowers your starting health. It doesn\\'t sound like much but it definitely hits a sweet spot.\\n\\nI played through this game on hard, which I don\\'t think gave any achievements or anything but definitely had a nice challenge to it. The bosses were all pretty nice and they all supposedly give you an item if you beat them without taking damage...I didn\\'t do that at all. The platforming aspect was crisp. Nothing felt particularly unfair or any pixel perfect landings needed. The combat was pretty good too. I found it strange how while an enemy was stunned you could get inside their hitbox and either keep hitting them to keep them stunned or roll away if it was a boss. Led for some attacks missing or just making the combat not particularly challenging in some spots. Overall it was good though.\\n\\nThe biggest con is the length. I get I could go back and speedrun it, or do an insane run, or beat it without killing or beat it without dying and all that good stuff for a challenge but that\\'s not really me. The 7.2 hours I have includes going back to find collectibles, which are done super well and hidden not to absurdly. The actual story is probably only about 4-6 hours, depending on diffculty and skill at these types of games. \\n\\nI think this game could be worth $10 to anyone who likes these styles of games or thinks they will want to try for the extra challenges. I think this game is closer to like $7 if you are only gonna play it once and maybe get collectibles and what not. as a person that loves the metroidvania genre of games this one is fenomanal. there are some flaws like every game out there, but only a few and are only details in a great game.\\nCONS:\\n1.- the story: without spoilers, i can honestly say that the story was missing something, maybe a little bit of personality from the protagonist, expansion of the world, an explanation on how things work the world. i can´t really say what it was especifically, but when i finished the game, i wanted more, learn more about the world, the caracters, almost everything, but even with that i was hoked all the way.\\n2.- there are some parts in the game where there is no music, which is a shame because the game has beautiful soundtrack.\\n3.- the fact that when you dodge it cancells your arrow charge, which is no big deal really, it´s only a  personal opinion\\n\\nPROS\\n1.- Responsive and fluid controld\\n2.- Excellent level design\\n3.- Fun bosses\\n4.- A surprising difficulty that makes everything interesting, even on normal mode\\n5.- The art style\\n6.- The atmosphere and sense of exploration\\n\\nI can probably say more, but ill leave it at that, would recommend 8.5/10 Summary: Momodora was fun. Brief, but fun. \\nIf you\\'re looking for a brief metroidvania with some dark souls lite combat, plus a minor dollop of interesting story, then you give it a try. Probably wait for a sale though. \\nHighlights: Atmosphere and art direction are stellar. \\nThere are enough different bosses to make things interesting (+1 secret boss)\\n\\nThings to be aware of: The game can be slightly punshing when played on higher difficulties. But if you\\'re prepared to play through that, then things will get easier. It also rewards high level play, awarding additional items if you take down a boss without taking a hit. If you are in for a very short challenge then this is a game for you otherwise maybe check it a bit further.\\n\\nI am bit underwhelmed by it, maybe my expectations were too high seeing as I saw this game being recommended here and there. \\nI got it with a discount if I am not mistaken and then the game is fine, otherwise I believe 10 bucks is a bit too much for what you get. \\nOveral the game is very cohesive in tone and atmosphere. Yes the bosses are challenging sometimes, though I do have to say also felt a bit unfair sometimes. Gorgeus graphics, ambientation and fun gameplay (more at the second half because of variety in skills, items and increasing difficulty). Totally waiting for the sequel :)\\nThe learning curve is perfectly done on the highest difficulty setting on a fresh start.\\nWhat a nice little gem, if you get it at a humble bundle this game alone will pay off the whole pack. The game has suprisingly plot and actual background story which made me buy the previous games as well. Beautiful and intense.  Has a moody and immersive horror vibe.  Above average difficulty.  I started on normal and have found a few sections frustrating.  I recommend starting on easy and then restarting on a harder level if you aren\\'t challenged.  A classy game.  Buy it. Overall it´s a pretty fun game, the only things that maybe drags it down is the music that is not the kinda music you could expect from some metroidvanias, but the mechanics are fun and work perfectly, there is a little of backtracking but i would have liked more, since they are a signature from metroidvanias, the feeling of finding a new ability and instantly think where to use it, but overall for the price is a very fun game for a couple of hours(5 hours or so), pretty good One of the best and the most beautiful games I have ever played. It has a great sence of exploration and this zelda feel to it. At the start of the adventure it\\'s hard to stay alive but then you keep finding these useful items that help you progress through out the story, making your adventure easier and more fun. Locations are memorable with songs that are suited perfectly. Characters are beautifuly disigned and many of them are girls, which I like. Two things I dislike about this game are the 2 elevators.\\nPlayed it on normal so it was not that difficult to beat.\\n\\n\\n10/10\\nWill play it again\\n i can\\'t get past the first part it\\'s too hard because i am bad at games Not fun within the first 9 minutes. This game is fun if you\\'re bored and wanting fun for everything else such as streaming.... Recommend buying if looking for some quality <3 Solid gameplay, fun mechanics, pleasant sounds, good music, interesting enough world, cute visuals, great level design. Easy reccomend.\\n\\nThis game was [b]extremely[/b] easy on whatever the standard difficulty was though, and was so short you could beat it in one sitting on a first playthrough, exploration and all (though i\\'m positive i must\\'ve missed some secrets). Might go back and try it on hard instead, and reccomend anyone who\\'s good at this type of game to just do that right off the bat. It was a good play, took me ~6h to complete. The mechanics were interesting and seemed well done.\\nMy favourite part of the game was probably either the cat switching or the music, which had its moments. \\nAs far as complaints go, the music was dull at some points, and the map doesn\\'t show you exactly where things are, it\\'s just the rooms.\\nOverall, it\\'s a great game, and if it\\'s on sale I\\'d definitely buy it. Really beautiful and entertaining game. A great work of art, if there\\'s such thing in the world of gaming. Exploring, getting abilities, fighting bosses... the usual in a Metroidvania I suppose, but very well done. \\n\\nThe character is very charismatic in my opinion and it\\'d be very nice to see more of her in other mediums. And of course, a new Momodora game.  \\n\\nAlso, it\\'s really inexpensive. :) tl;dr This game is decent, but it\\'s not something I\\'d recommend to people.\\n\\nPros:\\nThe platforming and combat are both handled well and feel very satisfying.\\n\\nThe art is great. It\\'s fairly faithful to the SNES era of console games, though it has a few more modern techniques.\\n\\nCons:\\nThe story is pretty weak. It may be a product of trying to stick to the aesthetic of early console games, but I didn\\'t find it engaging and even forgot the goal of the game for a while until I went back and talked to NPCs again.\\n\\nThe game mechanics aren\\'t always clear. Jumping into water in some places leads to new areas, while in other places it kills you instantly. The same is true for pits. Sometimes the edge of a screen can be passed through, while other times it\\'s an invisible barrier.\\n\\nA lot of the NPC dialogue is short and pointless. You find random people around but many of them do things like tell you to go away or complain about cake. This isn\\'t the sort of game that usually has a lot of NPCs, and the odd dialogue felt rather stilted.\\n\\nA few UI elements felt underdeveloped. You can\\'t tell which save points you can warp to on the map, and when warping you can only see named areas to choose from, not where those areas are on the unlabeled map. You also can\\'t easily quit the game unless you die. If you save and want to quit, you have to exit to the main menu first. You can\\'t even use Alt+F4.\\n\\nThe areas weren\\'t very distinct. They looked different from one another, certainly, but there often wasn\\'t much of an indication when you were traveling between places. It gave the game a feeling more like traveling through a building with different styles per section. The lack of any differences on the map added to this.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nI\\'m not sad I played this game. I did enjoy it. There was some unnecessary frustration but nothing really struck me as bad. Still, it\\'s not something I would tell my friends they need to play and I find the current \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" status of its reviews surprising. I felt I should share my thoughts on it because I wasn\\'t quite as impressed as the majority of reviewers seem to be. You can turn into a cat. Honestly that\\'s all you should have to hear. A beautiful and atmospheric platformer. From a graphical and audio point of view, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is of masterful quality. The gameplay is also satisfying to execute within the carefully crafted environments. The fragments of story scattered throughout the game are thought-provoking, but also disjointed and occasionally obtrusive. The main issues with Momodora come from pacing issues derived from backtracking. Momodora also doesn\\'t present any exhilarating or memorable experiences. Overall, however, Momodora adheres to a picturesque model of what a modern platformer should be. Amazing game! Short but completely satisfying! Cute animations and great work with details! Gorgeous pixel art and a sweet sound-track make up a delicious metroidvenia experience.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth it. Almost all the puzzles make sense and the layout and minimap are very well done.\\n\\nYou open up quick passages, similar to Dark Souls and the difficulty and healing is similar to that game as well.\\n\\nBuy it. It\\'s worth it. Good gameplay, good controls, good art, good music, smooth animations and cute girls. Good game. Good game, but for your mental health I highly recommend playing the game in easy mode first,. no matter how good you think you are at metroidvania games, this one is pretty hard even in normal mode.\\nEasy mode will allow you to enjoy the story, and still get killed a few times.\\n\\nLast boss has an instakill ability which is pretty unfair... I read good things about Momodora.\\nJust say no.\\n\\nExtremely repetitive bosses.\\nBoring enemy AI.\\nInsta-kill obstacles.\\nRandom boss attacks with either a MASSIVE tell or ZERO tell.\\n\\nJiggling witch boobs, though, I guess. really interesting, non-linear gameplay !! awesome art and animation\\nthe story wasn\\'t overly complex, but it was compelling and served its purpose\\nmy brother gave the game to me, but i would totally pay $10 for momodora (: one of my favorite games It\\'s overwhelmingly positive for a reason:\\nAmazing game, very beautiful OST and graphics, Kaho controls really good, and the ending made me shed a tear, 10/10\\nMust buy for any metroidvania lovers, or anyone in general, wish I could forget about the game just to play it for the first time again Great, now I\\'m attracted to... whatever those things are. 100% worth your money at any price. Might be short but has new things to experience on second playthrough. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is short and unforgiving, but it isn\\'t so hard that a new player couldn\\'t pick it up and enjoy it.  The different power-ups you pick up make the game easier, but never making the player feel invincible.  Once I got used to the difficulty, it was fine for me, though I am relatively used to Metroidvania games.  I\\'d definitely recommend it to people that enjoy Metroidvania games. Fantastic game. My only issue was that normal was a tad easy. Hard seems like it should have been normal. This is so perfect!\\n Best metroidvania I have played since castlevania sotn. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is fantastic. It brings the 16-bit style to contemporary standards. Kaho\\'s sprite animation is exceptionally well drawn and fluid. New items are fun to find. Backtracking didn\\'t feel like a pain, as there are plenty of secrets to find and blocked passages that become traversable after new finds. Each level feels distinct and somber. I rarely had to grind munny, and when I did it was super quick. Music is simple but effective. It may not be particularly memorable but it fades into the background and sets the tone just as it is supposed to do; it\\'s very inoffensive. Boss music, though, could be a little more bombastic.\\n\\nThe only thing that made me hesitant to get Momodora was the anime style and the \"cute\" tag. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Kaho is just jovial enough to fit with the game\\'s style without the game or its characters becoming completely saccharine or cheesy. Bravo to the devs for nailing that.\\n\\nMy biggest crit would be that some of the bossses\\' first attacks are one-shots, and they\\'re quick too. Was I asking for it by playing on Hard mode? Maybe, but I would perhaps rather these moves just cripple my health and have half as many bellflowers to compensate, for even less total damage absorption and arguably an even harder but less frustrating experience. It isn\\'t fun to run all the way to the boss and get no time to understand the attack that\\'s murdering me at the outset. And if you\\'re getting one-shotted on Hard, where do you go from there? Some of the bosses are no more difficult on \"Insane\" difficulty as they were on \"Hard.\"\\n\\nA couple minor crits to follow:\\nThe dialogue reads like a vanilla forum post. It\\'s not terrible, but it\\'s not striking in its word choice either. And they all speak the same, unless they\\'re fulfilling a trope. Give the characters some real written voice and make me pull out a dictionary every so often. Ironically, the mute protagonist has the most personality out of the entire cast.\\n\\nThe Witch doesn\\'t have much animation to her in stark contrast to the care and attention given to Kaho. Her large size works against her, bringing more attention to this detail; what is supposed to be a dramatic encounter ends up falling flat because of it.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t meant to complain, but rather a suggestion of where the sequel might deserve some extra attention.\\n\\n\\nThat all aside, this game is wonderful, deserves its Overwhelmingly Positive rating,  and I recommend it to everyone. Very very short. The bosses are super easy, usually killable in one or two tries, even the true final boss only took two tries. But the exploration is significantly more punishing, though that\\'s not saying much. Spikes are insta death and some range mobs are unkillable by design. That being said, it never got frustrating or anything, since the save points are everywhere. \\n\\nThe game felt like it wasn\\'t fleshed out enough. All of the bosses could\\'ve been switched around and I probably wouldn\\'t have noticed. The big boss shown in the preview you fight twice and is the most interesting boss in terms of looks, but like most of the bosses no one ever says anything about her so she\\'s just a random giant girl you smacked the tits off of with a leaf without asking any questions about it.\\n\\nThe gameplay was good, the controls were on the whole pretty tight once you got used to them, with a few small hickups. The devs did a good job designing the enemies with the constraints of your character\\'s abilities in mind. I would say that the combat is pretty simplistic, but it doesn\\'t get tiring because of the short length of the game.\\n\\nIn summary, if the game was more fleshed out in pretty much every way, it would be a fantastic game. It\\'s still worth the price if you\\'re not looking for sometihng to get too invested in, but if it was significantly longer with more care put into the story and game design then I could easily see myself paying triple. If you have any standards you will hate this game. Extremely punishing game that has a bad flow. The controls aren\\'t tight enough to do the things that they want, with attacks going in the wrong direction on certain encounters. There is a ton of button mashing.\\n\\nThe worst thing for me is getting to a dead end and having to run backwards through a level. This happens pretty frequently. It often results in a mistake and a loss of 5 or so minutes of playing that you have to redo.\\n\\nAnother thing that the game does that is very frustrating is throwing new obstacles or enemies at you just before a save point. Worse, I ran into a situation where the game threw this at me just before a dead end, forcing me to go backwards. Just before the save point, there are spikes that can instantly kill you above and below you that you have to time a jump through.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are enemies put between you and save points after boss fights. You struggle on a boss fight, feel good, and then suddenly you are thrown into a situation with random enemies. If you like beating a tough boss fight, then getting killed by some random monster only to have to redo that fight again, this game is for you. AWESOME! One of my favorite metroidvania games. Beautiful and challenging. If you have any interest in the genre, make Momodora your next purchase. Wow, that was good. I could hardly put this one down!  This is a short Metroidvania-style game with polished pixel graphics and highly responsive controls.  Movement through the world is nonlinear after the first region.  There are several enhancements (strewn about the game) to your basic capabilities; two of them permit the exploration of new areas.  You can also purchase active and passive items that add even more strategic variety.\\n\\nWhat sets this game apart from others of the genre is the ability to dodge.  At the start, your character can perform a \"roll\" maneuver.  This allows her to temporarily avoid not just enemy projectiles, but the enemies themselves.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is understated, yet pertinent.  The boss music is particularly exciting.  Speaking of bosses, it has several.  Each boss typically follows a pattern and/or telegraphs its next move.  I found the boss fights easier than the typical ones in, say, Mega Man 2.  Conquering a boss perfectly (taking no damage) usually grants a unique item.\\n\\nPRO TIP:  There is a an auto-map.  If you use a gamepad, try holding down the Select (Back) button.  I got 80% through before realizing it existed.  :-D\\n\\nIf you like Shantae: Risky\\'s Revenge, you\\'ll almost certainly like this. Got this from a humble bundle, and was one of the games I wanted to get. I first found out about this game when watching a speedrunner play through it. Seemed interesting enough and I just completed the game once. Here are some things to note:\\n\\n- Game is short (4 and half hours for first playthrough). BUT on the contrary, achievements, difficulty modes, collectables, multiple endings (?), and perhaps speedrunning definitely should make it last a little while longer.\\n- At first, the gameplay seemed a bit too simple. In general, the combat at times feels like \"keep mashing buttons!\" for the casual player (like me). However, I could see the complexity and the gameplay gets much more fun during the other last half of the game\\n- Found this to be a flaw, maybe you disagree, but, most of the bossfights I didn\\'t like. There\\'s nothing wrong with the boss itself (attacks are varied and interesting), but how I managed to defeat them. Like I mentioned, all I did was mostly mash the melee button and I noticed the lack of platforming during such fights. Perhaps that\\'s the point of Metroidvanias so correct me if I\\'m wrong\\n- Similarly, during a couple of boss fights, there\\'s literally too much going on, so you sometimes can\\'t see the signal for the next attack (and more over, it almost feels like trial and error, and memorizing their moveset)\\n- I don\\'t know if this is how the genre goes but this game kept kicking my butt... on normal mode (good luck to those on \"insane\"). At times, it feels very cheap. Dying discourages the player to keep playing, because sometimes you spawn so far away from your previous location that it gets pretty annoying\\n- For the most part, you\\'re free to explore, but for me, I felt I spent too much time backtracking\\n- In terms of story.... I got sort of lost. Maybe this is because this is the fourth installment, but anyways, the basic plot still stands. Though I was hoping for more character interactions and maybe lore.\\n- Music is nice and sets the mood. A few tracks are good, but nothing incredibly notable.\\n- The graphics are beautiful. All of the areas are unique and are just amazing to look at.\\n- Options are well appreciated. Screenshake and vibration was hurting my eyes so the ability to turn them off is a plus\\n- I used a controller (DS4) and it worked just fine. Not sure about keyboard\\n\\nAnyways, if you didn\\'t read the lengthy blob, this game overall is simply a good game, but honestly not anything you need to play right away. Buy it on a sale. Hopefully this helped anyone and if you have any questions, I\\'d be happy to answer. Fun little metroidvania with souls-ish combat, but I think comparisons to Dark Souls are generally overstated. Easy to miss the boss that gives you fast travel, so look up where to do that first. Pretty good game, albeit somewhat short.  I finished with all life upgrades, almost 100% map, and true ending under 6 hours.  The game starts off pretty brutal if you aren\\'t careful, but the dificulty levels off after you get a few power-ups.  The story is fairly thin, and NPC encounters are sparse and cryptic.  There aren\\'t a lot of movement-enhancing abilities you get during the game.  There isn\\'t too much backtracking.  The difficulty of the boss battles is just right.  Not obscenely hard, but you will die once or twice on most of them. Really good! Great soundtrack, visuals, gameplay. Although I had my ups and downs playing this game, I must say this is probably on of my favorite games here on steam. It is my first official metroidvania style game and first Momodora game. I loved the exploration factor, it is nor too simple nor too back-and-forth (I played in normal mode, for reference. I understand some metroidnavias can go heavier on the back-and-forth aspect). Boss fights are also quite fair, with enough challenge. If you\\'re a newb like me and are still practicing reading/predicting your enemies, you\\'ll find them pretty challenging, but fun nonetheless. Fighting mechanics arent too difficult to grasp, and you\\'ll find a variety of items & upgrades to help you along your journey. The story is quite simple [spoiler] and quite sad, with either ending, although I feel true ending is worse [/spoiler]. I find you can get lost in details, as I did if you don\\'t play consistently. It is a relatively short game for most people, although it took longer for me because of how I play. Also, I absolutely love the artwork, in game and out. Additionally, you get to be a cat in this game, end of story. It\\'s a beautiful game, 100% percent recommend. Started playing this game and instantly hated the default keyboard controls, plugged in my controller and the hints that popped up on how to play and what keys to use were only showing for keyboard no matter what I did. There was a setting to change the controller layout, but no matter what I did it never changed from the default controller controls *which I also hated*. Bad first impression and controls, wont be playing again. I was hoping this is a fun platformer. It\\'s not.\\n\\nFirst, the control scheme on the keyboard is unchangable and, quite frankly, idiotic. Secondly - abundant instant-death traps and falls. These two things alone don\\'t make for a compelling game.\\n\\nAnd those things attacked me during the first 0.5h of playing the game. I dread what will happen next... Cute, short, and absolutely worth playing. aNimE TiDdiES A solid metroidvania style game. harder in the beginning, but more forgiving the better you get at it.\\nLiterally rewards you for skilled play, any boss you clear eith no damage, you gain a useful item from. The second last boss for instance gives you an arrow upgrade that makes the final boss a joke.\\nMultiple endings, depending if you upgraded the power of your main weapon (also gives the final boss a third form)\\nHonestly, it took a long time to finish this game off on Insane, the difficulty where you are a one-hit wonder, even to generic enemies (spoilers; most of the junk enemies will be more deadly to you than the bosses)\\nThere\\'s also a hidden, secret boss, as well. She\\'s a reasonable challenge and feels appropriately difficult for a secret boss.\\nI haven\\'t played anything else in the Momodora series, but this is an awesome 4th installment of any platformer. Tight, responsive 2d Metriodvania soulslike. The best pixel art alongside Owlboy with gorgeous animation and attention to detail. Surprisingly atmospheric despite its budget and art style with many interesting and varied bosses. \\n\\nOnly downsides are a lack of customization with a single melee and ranged weapon (without unlocking special boss items) and a short playtime, leaving many characters unfulfilled and lacking proper characterization. Would definitely recommend either way for the uniqueness alone, just don\\'t expect this to give you a massive amount of playtime. This is a very good game, if you like metroidvanias, you can\\'t miss this. Very very good! Excellent game! Very short, though. Incredibly refined animations and pixel art (which i\\'m very much a sucker for), paired with a really satisfying combat system makes for a really fun game to eat through in 5-ish hours. The game isn\\'t excessively hard, but it can get pretty bonkers on Insane difficulty, so it\\'s kind of a game for a very broad range of skill levels. It reminds me a lot of Shantae in terms of character designs, where almost every character and enemy is either a waifu or a goofy-looking-monster-thing. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good way to kill a weekend. Wonderful game, would reccomend it ten times over. It takes a bit to get used to the combat system but other than that it is a masterpiece. Excelent game - can not recomend this enough. EDIT: I used to have this as a negative review, but I\\'m changing it to positive because I realized that how short it is may not be a negative, and also that it\\'s a great metroidvania to start people on the genre, exactly because it\\'s so short, and the atmosphere makes it worth it.\\n\\nIt\\'s short.\\n\\nEvery time I think about what bothers me about this game, the main answer is that it\\'s just really short. That\\'s the main complaint. The world and characters are not even close to fleshed out, the actual amount of areas, enemies and bosses, as well as their complexity, is very lacking. Even without that being the case, it\\'s very generic everywhere else. The movement doesn\\'t feel as well designed (or rather, the game doesn\\'t feel designed around the movement), as much as it does in say, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells or La-Mulana. The combat is just a basic \"you have a melee attack and you have a ranged attack\", except it\\'s not done that well. The story feels lazily written and uninspired, as do the characters. The boss fights are either unfair and aren\\'t designed around the movement, attacks and responsiveness of your character, or they are way too simple. The attacks where you just wait in place for a while, or hope something doesn\\'t hit you, are the cherry on top. The hitboxes are waaaaay off. (I\\'m saying this after finishing \"insane mode\" by the way, so it\\'s not like I don\\'t know the patterns)\\n\\nThe one major positive I could give this game is that the atmosphere is great, as well as the sound design, OST and visuals that bolster it. But overall, I don\\'t feel like this game was worth my time (I can\\'t complain about the price, since I got it as part of a bundle).\\n\\nI still feel like there were some cool ideas. If you could switch to cat form on the fly, and maybe had expanded movement options with it, it could make for interesting platforming and more fluid movement. The combat is a neat idea, but the movement and responsiveness really needs to be sharper. This is a game where more control would help. And most of all, I really want time to be spent to flesh it out. The world, bosses, enemies, complexity, it would\\'ve benefited so much from things just being added all over the place.\\n\\nI\\'m interested to see what the dev will have next, and I\\'m sure they\\'ve learned a bunch from making this and all the reviews it got. I only  completed this game so that I\\'d never have to play it again. Soulslike platformer that learned all the wrong lessons from that genre. Of my four hour playthrough, roughly 2 hours was spent waiting; for platforms, for enemies, for boss attack animations to finish.\\n\\nIt\\'s a shame, because the graphics are great and the gameplay feels tight. But I wish they had spent as much time on level design and boss improvements as they did getting making the witch\\'s jiggle animation. animations look great, but end up being super clunky in the combat the game sets out, some enemies have contact damage, some dont(even bosses choose randomly on this), some enemies that look exactly the same as others have entirely different attacks that need to to already be doing something that counters them, and sometimes the action that counters one, and the action that counters something that looks just like it are entirely different things, sometimes enemies spawn inside of you already doing an attack that will do most of your health in damage because you should totally already know where the enemies are going to spawn before you start the game up, animations arent very clear in many instances, some enemies just arent vulnerable in any way shape or form for a super long time, tons of stupid bullshit to learn, like having to crouch when shooting your bow in order to do any damage, but not a lot of actual skill involved once you do learn it, difficult for newbies to learn, not much of a reward for doing so(hell theres even an item that seems to be in there for newbs, it heals you slowly. you might be thinking \"oh so as long as i just wait for like a full min out of combat ill heal up?\" no, slowly as in walk away for a full 5 mins and dont even get half your health back from it).\\n\\nIt seems like the game is more about \"how can we make you die on your first playthrough?\" than \"how can we make a game that has depth?\" Yes. Yes. More yes. Not enough yes. Too much good stuff. Give me more. Great game. If you\\'re looking for 4-8 hours worth of platforming pixelated fun then this is probably the game for you. The art is very nice, the sprites done very well, the animation of the attacks and everything else is great too! The backgrounds are really nice, and the characters are interestingly designed. So it\\'s a visually appealing game.\\n\\nCombat wise, it\\'s pretty easy to pick up with a controller. The melee combo is simple and allows you to stun enemies, the bow and arrow is your range weapon and can be charged for more arrows and damage. Dodging is done by rolling, just be careful not to roll into the enemy\\'s hitbox or you\\'ll get hurt. You want to roll _past_ them. You can unlock spells and some other special things with items in the game. It\\'s simple, but handles well. For playforming the jump controls and handling are responsive and shouldn\\'t give anyone trouble.\\n\\nIf you\\'d compare this game to something similar, like hollow knight, then hollow knight would provide more variety of ways to get around (bouncing off enemies heads for one to get accross a pit) but this game lends itself well to beginner platformers I think so you could easily give this to a newcomer to the genre and they\\'d be happy.\\n\\nThe story is told through the NPC\\'s and vague references + item descriptions. Very similar to hollow knight and dark souls games. There\\'s lore discussions in the steam community discussions though so if you thirst for that go drink up. The boss\\'s are fun to fight, and you can get bonuses for defeating them without getting hurt. It\\'s a fun game.\\n\\nThere is a bad ending and a true ending. I got the bad ending first because I just wanted to beat it in one playthrough without thinking too hard, and 4.5 hours later I was done. It didn\\'t take that much longer to collect all the bug items, purchase all the times I could, and unlock the true ending by talking to the NPC\\'s more. \\n\\nWord of advice: If it talks, don\\'t hit it. You\\'ll thank me later. Seriously a 10/10 game, I don\\'t say that lightly. Worth every cent.\\n\\nFantastic game. Wonderful world.\\n- Really tight controls and fun mechanics.\\n- The visual and audio art mesh well and keep you immersed in the world.\\n- Took me about 6 hours to complete.\\n- Difficulty is on par with what you select.\\n- Almost every NPC has a story line to follow along with. (Make sure you get all dialog from each encounter.) Great Metroidvanian. Seems pretty hard at first, but once you get the hang of it its still challenging, but super fun.\\n\\nBest part: You can be a cat :) One of the most amazing platformers I\\'ve played in years (received as a gift)\\n\\n*Summary*\\nThis game is good overall. It\\'s not great. But a nice short little title that doesn\\'t outstay its welcome, and offers the right amount of challenge.\\n\\n*Music*\\nUltimately forgettable, but serviceable. The game is a 50-50 mix of melodies and just atmospheric ambience. While the melodies are not good, the ambient music is very good (dark and heavy bass which creates a feeling of dread).\\n\\n*Art/Environment*\\nThe SNES look lends itself well for this game. The art borrows heavily from Anime (very Sailor Moon-ish), and pulls this off well. The environments are well done, and there is a good variety of locations. The placement of the locations add to the world building, and help tell the story.\\nAt first I thought this would be very fan service-y --> The main character has a short black dress with high red stockings, and they keep advertising the decay witch, with the low top, and you\\'re basically attacking her breasts. That\\'s really the extent of it [spoiler] After you defeat the Queen in the good ending, you can kind of see the outline of her legs/but as she lies on the ground, but nothing close to revealing, since it\\'s a small sprite [/spoiler]. While I\\'m fine with fan service (they definitely could have had more if they wanted to), it\\'s good that it doesn\\'t devolve into a \\'sexy anime girl fight\\' game -- since that really wouldn\\'t fit the theme well.\\nEnemy design is mostly good (few stupid ones, like spinning painting).\\nThe bosses are nicely varied, and all have their own distinct looks.\\n\\n*Story*\\nA little barren, but it works for this type of game (lighter, shorter). The NPC\\'s do well to build the world through bits of dialogue (even though your character doesn\\'t respond -- odd considering Half-Life was voiced, so having Gordon talk would break the fantasy, but here there is no voice...), and as I mentioned, the environments are placed in a logical way that would make sense as you travelled from location to location. Overall, it\\'s not devoid of story, but don\\'t expect to be able to put anything signicant together -- again, very SNES like. You understand generally what\\'s happening, and then must use your imagination for the rest.\\n\\n*Gameplay*\\nThis is what really counts, and overall... it\\'s ok (good, not great). Attacking roots your movement, which feels a little outdated. You have a melee, and a ranged attack.\\nMelee lets you stun your opponents, which is a nice idea, but sometimes makes things too simple (trivializes fodder enemies by stunlocking them).\\nThe boss fights are quite well done. For such a small game, there are plenty of bosses, and all feel different enough. You can never just tank through a boss and spam attack, you\\'ll have to dodge and plan your entries. Sometimes, you can use your bow and arrow to cheese a victory (which is silly, but it\\'s up to the player -- some bosses take no arrow damage).\\nFinding secrets/upgrades is a good idea, and it\\'s fine. I just wish there were some more interesting things to find (more items that offer pros/cons, instead, there are a bunch of standard things: heal, more damage, more gold, find secrets easier, etc).\\n\\n*Conclusion*\\nIf you like Castlevania type games, you should give this one a play. While it is good, it falls in the middle of the pack since games like Hollow Knight have pushed the bar so far.\\nIt\\'s a short and sweet game, and it offers enough challenge/exploration without outstaying its welcome.\\nGive it a try. Great Game! Good anime aesthetic, dark souls-style combat, and a well crafted metroidvania world to tie it all together. My only complains are that its very short (I beat it in 5 hours) and the achievements suck (within that 5 hours I didn\\'t get a single one)\\n\\n6/10 Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight looks like a simple game at first glance, but it\\'s actually quite detailed with plenty of areas and secrets to explore and discover.\\n\\nChallenging at first, it gets more and more entertaining as you get used to the game.\\n\\nGameplay is smooth, along with the visuals and atmospheric music to match it.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I played this just so that I could spank the witch\\'s giant boobs but I got more than I expected. Awesome. It is cute and well done. Simple, but not in a bad way. When I was first suggested this game I thought I wouldn\\'t enjoy it because I\\'m not a fan of these kinds of games in general.\\n\\nSo you could imagine my surprise when i found myself enjoying it and even wanting to 100% the game. The game is hard yet fair, every time I died I never felt like when I died it was the fault of the game or controls but rather my own for fucking up the jump or mis timed that roll. This game has even made me want to try the rest of the series and might have even made me love this genre of game.\\n\\nI give this game a 9/10 3/5...but most definitely recommended.\\n\\nI finally picked this game up after watching Half-Coordinated play it during one of the GDQ marathons, and as a disclaimer, I played it on Easy.\\n\\nHonestly wish I\\'d played it at least on Normal, and I probably will at some point in the future.\\n\\nThe graphics are fantastic, as is the music. Combat is fun and chunky (by that I mean your attacks carry weight and hitting enemies feels really good), and new abilities are doled out in a sensible, if frequent, manner.\\n\\nIt truly is a game about exploration, with no waypoints to speak of; just going along until you reach an impassible obstacle, then return later once you\\'ve gained an ability or key that will let you pass it.\\n\\nThere seems to be two major problems, though, each taking nearly a full star away from my final score.\\n\\n1: The resolution is stuck in 4:3, so if you\\'re playing on a widescreen monitor (as most people do these days, and have been for some time), you\\'re left with black edges on the left and right. This is, honestly, inexcusable anymore. Fortunately, the devs have expressed regret at this decision, and will be taking it into account in all future projects. It isn\\'t something that should stop you from getting the game, though, which is why I still recommend it.\\n\\n2: (Remember, I played on Easy) I managed to beat the game the first time in about 3-1/2 hours. Now, I was nowhere near 100% map completion (maybe missing 20% or so? I didn\\'t check before I stumbled across the final boss), but I wasn\\'t hurrying or being impatient or anything. I even managed to get the \"True Ending\" just doing my thing and not looking up any guides or anything.\\n\\nThat\\'s a really pitiful amount of playtime for a Metroidvania imo.\\n\\nI\\'m glad to say, however, that what is there, is worth playing. It just felt a little abbreviated. If you\\'re looking for a sprawling map and 10-20 hours of exploration like Ori and the Blind Forest or Hollow Knight, you\\'ll be left feeling like you only got half of a game.\\n\\nAt the very least, pick it up on sale, but imo, for $10, I\\'d say it\\'s worth the purchase, especially when you consider that it has a New Game+ mode and two harder difficulties which I\\'m sure would add to the play time.\\n\\nJust do yourself a favor and start on Normal first, then maybe switch to Easy if it\\'s too much for you.\\n its a pretty rad game 10/10 game. Good gameplay, world, bosses, music, exploration. 3 levels of difficulty to make everyone happy. Easy is way easier than normal but still not a complete cakewalk. Would recommend, and am going to replay it at least once or twice. this isnt a hard game, this is a fricking stupid game. not fair in the slightest. music is nice tho 4/10 just for the piano This is a quality game i must say, good story + character + art. The controlling is pretty easy to learn and the game is not really hard (and even have 4 diff) so anyone could play and enjoy the game. I have completed all the achievement even though this is the first time i ever played (seriously) a metroidvania game so you could tell how easy the game is :/\\nThe only problem to me is that you cant quit game immidietly while playing except from dying, but meh, its a really good game I love it. Love it love it love it love it. If you are familiar with Metroidvania-style games, you\\'ll love it. If you never played that kind of game, give this one a try and it just might be your introduction to the genre. Gosh I love this game. Hell of a game. Gorgeous art, good music, nice level of difficulty, lots of personality. can\\'t go wrong with this one.\\nMap could be a little better but that\\'s the only major complaint i have. This game is fairly simple and fun. It\\'s long enough to be enjoyable but not too lengthy that it becomes annoying. It\\'s not too hard to find your way again if you get lost. Power-ups and magic are balanced and it takes skill to beat some of the boss. I like this game. Giving me the \\'vaina vibes that I desire. This is one of the first games I\\'ve played in a while where the punishing difficulty/ ease of death is actually something I like alot. The spooky music and enemies, the graphics, texture, style of combat. I\\'m very impressed by all of it, and would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a gothic adventure, medeval/ romantic-era sidescroller, metroidvaina, or rouge-lite (does the ease of death/ style of game make this a rogue lite?).\\n\\nMy only complaint is a bug that seems to be specific to the Mac version that causes examining items/ speaking with NPC\\'s using a controller to cause the whole game to glitch and freeze, but it seems to be happening less and less, and I\\'ve developed the habit of saving before speaking to NPC\\'s to avoid risk.\\n\\nBeautiful pixel graphics, with fluid framefate and animation: reminiscent of Hyper-Light Drifter, or Out of This World (for you SNES\\'ers out there). Art Direction and (some) of the sound track are applaudable, but the gameplay is subpar at best. \\n\\nCombat:\\n The animations slow down combat so instead of a risk reward when you attack, its more like \"I hope my attack hits first\" because once you\\'ve pressed that button your bascially a leaf in the wind. It does\\'nt feel good to fight anything, most of the time you\\'re readying arrows so you dont actualy have to use your main weapon, which is also easily outclassed by your \"secondary\" the bow, in speed, damage and even upgrades.   Bosses are unrewarding and dull, for the most part they consist of: Dodge their attack that covers entire screen, then attack them, dodge slightly different attack, attack them, Etc. Etc. The rewards are usually \"The Key of Whatever\" and you need all of them to unlock the next area, so you can collect even more!  If you do end up wasting your time by attempting to defeat the boss without taking any damage, you\\'re rewarded with:  (drum roll) and item or upgrde that makes all other bosses even more dull and repetitive!  \\n\\nLevels:\\nIt\\'s an utter shame the wonderfull artwork is used on such subpar level design, its increadibly unclear what will kill you and what will not.  E.G. random pits.  This one progresses the level, this one kills you instantly.  theres tons of dead ends and pointless areas that even after unlocking other abilities they mean nothing. There is no direction. You\\'re waling aimlessly hoping you find a secret you missed 2 hours ago, or God forbid the rest of the level, I played about 1 hour of this game, but I\\'ve backtracked for another 2. Nothing hints at where you should go next,  \"You should go to the castle, I heard thats the next area!\"  Really? wow, it would be amazing if you told me maybe how to get there or just a general direction, but no. Yeah I get it \"exploration\" and all that but no. The way levels are set up is that you go to an area, fight the boss, and leave, you dont continue past the boss most of the time, wich would be intuitive, you have to go back through the level, searching every nook and cranny hoping there was a door you missed or a hole you can crawl in to find the next area. It\\'s less like exploring an open world full of wonder, and more like being lost at the Mall but they forgot to put up maps and when you do ask someone for directions, they just tell you the name of your destination.  When you are aimlessly exploring the world,  you arn\\'t rewarding for finding secrets either, you either get a subpar item, that will be used once until you get the slightly better items, or the completly worthless curency that is endlessly farmable and pointless because you can buy a total of 5 things with it.\\n  \\nSound:\\nEverything has that \"classic\" bit-crushed style to it, no big deal. But the soundtrack, or lack of one seeing as how you do not hear it most of the time, is subpar.  (it is mostly ambient music, with the exception of bosses or \"cutscenes\") Last boss was much much easier than others bosses. Other than that, 10/10. It good good game The games short, but still really fun. A pretty fun Metroidvania. If you love that genre of games and want more of that, this game is pretty good. Its combat and its exploration can be a little weak and frustrating though (if you took them on their own merit alone). The game is only really good, gameplay wise, if you look at the sum of its parts. The one thing this game really excels at is its art style. The game is very pretty with detailed and nicely designed sprites (the background and textures can be kind of dull though).\\nTL;DR: Good, but if you can\\'t appreciate the art, you won\\'t enjoy the game. its fine. Musics not amazing, storys not amazing, but plenty of games have done worse. Wish there was more to it, more use of metroidvania upgrades but its there and its gone i finished it in an afternoon (despite what the playtime says the file time is around 3 hours). \\nIts no hollow knight and has a lot of personality defined around being castlevania inspired (albiet with more women ... and catgirls). The most egregious part of the game is a boss with boob jiggle. gamers, this game is like\\ndark souls\\n\\nhigh kiwi to keep this short this review will be in bullet points and to the point.\\nCombat is pretty clunky and has no flow to it, boss battles are frustrating and counterintuitive with the patterns, lots of trail & error, I dont have trouble playing a challenging game just not one made hard for the sake of \"oh look im like castlevania\" when it has nothing apart from the art that makes a good side scrolling game.\\nenemies placement is bad with little thought.\\nThe movement isn\\'t too bad but leaves a lot to be desired with the clumsy rolls and general unresponsiveness of your character.\\nThe artstyle is one of this games strong points being able to convey the story through the environment, I will not disclose story spoilers.\\nthe music consists of the same ominous tracks which isn\\'t bad per say but the lack of variation \\nweares the novelty off  fast.\\n\\nTL;DR (for lazy buggers) the art good, gameplay not so good, story passable and scores a meh/10. This game has left me absolutely speechless. I had an itch for a game like this and this game relieved my itch perfectly. In this masterpiece you play as a young otaku girl named Tispe. Tispe is a Red Riding Hood cosplayer who happens to have small breasts and gets depressed seeing other women with bigger breast so progressing through the game you can see everything is a metaphor for how you\\'re fighting off your own insecurities and harassment online. Every boss you fight you need to aim to hit the boobs (as every boss in game are cosplay women with huge breasts) this will cause you to deflate their breasts and you\\'ll gain more BP (Boob Points) till you fight the final boss who carries the title of this game, Momodora (AKA Momokun)\\n\\n\\nAt the start of the game you play as Tispe in a dark room with only a little light emanating from a computer screen. A lot of players who played this for the first time don\\'t know what exactly to do here because you can\\'t attack, jump, or interact with anything (yet). You\\'re supposed to face towards the screen and after 15 seconds a cutscene will happen in which Tispe will jump into the screen. Once this happens you will find yourself at a beach and thus the game begins. You will need to avoid being seen at this part because the antagonist, Momokun is going around touching various people on their butt. While this segment isn\\'t hard and is meant to teach you the basics of this game, watch out because if you get touched even once you will lose access to a special cosplay room later in the game.\\n\\nAfter advancing past the beach level you will find lots of common enemies to fight ranging from insecurities, meninists, harassers, and haters. And thus your joruney begins. You go through a set of levels until you reach the cosplay bosses. The first one being Pink Sparkles who you need to be careful of because she will try to trick you into think she\\'s attacking you, but really it\\'s just a prerecorded attack she\\'s using as her own. If you don\\'t move it won\\'t effect you. You need to find a way to get her to dance around the stage until she gets hit by a hammer. After she\\'s stunned attack her boobs and cause as much damage as possible! \\n\\n-SPOILER ALERT-\\n\\nAbout half way in the game you will unlock PMS (Psychotic Mood Shift) allowing you to do stronger attacks for a short Period.. of time. This will greatly help you in this game. Then once you get towards the end of the game after getting a lot of BP you\\'re going to want to make sure you find the salt shaker before you fight Momokun. It isn\\'t necessary to complete the game, but the salt shaker, the \"ADHD is not an excuse\" gun, and PMS powers will help you in the end. The boss is pretty challenging, but very possible! After you beat Momokun and take her followers away, Tispe will realise that she doesn\\'t need big breasts to be happy. And is greatful to have such a nice personality because in the end that\\'s what attracts followers. But only after a sick ass diss track.\\n\\nHoped this helped anybody thinking about buying the game.\\nGood luck! I love this game!\\nThe gameplay is fun, the characters are lovely (I especially like the cat witch and fennel) and the graphics aRE GORGEOUS!!\\nI tried to get all achievements but I gave up at the one where I have to finish the game in extreme mode (it\\'s so frustrating!)\\nBut I definitely recommend this game and I can\\'t wait to play the other momodora titels Momodora: reverie under the moonlight is an surprisingly refreashing action, adventure platformer with some amazing boss fights that will test your skills with a sacred leaf. I highly recommend you pick this one up if you enjoy lofty, somber soundtracks and beautiful pixel art and spritework.\\n\\ni give Momodora: reverie under the moonlight...     A Seven outta Ten. great\\n It has been a while since I last pourchased and binge 100% completed the game. I just recently saw the 2018 update launching and I have to say, that before when I got this game it was an instant masterpiece for me, but now with the easier accessibility to more hidden things, (based on the patch notes) and overall fixes of the few problems the game had it is now a must buy to anyone who likes 2d platform action adventures, and any who are looking for a great and fulfiling game.\\nStory is sufficiently good, bosses are interesting and well balanced, if I could I\\'d keep buying this game just to support the devs :D (in fact both my steam accounts have this game maxed, although I lost the other one recently due to forgetting about it since I only use this one now) :ccc\\nAll in all I highly recommen this game it is one of the best, and offers everything from a breeze to tough as nails challange >_> looking at you insane mode hidden bossfight...\\nBut yes it is replayable too. I myself have finished the game quite a lot of times on all difficulties.\\nThe review is not really cohesive I get it but I hope I could convey my love for this game!!\\nTo the devs if you read this: Thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving us such great games and I hope you can keep up the good work :D Good combat and overall a good experience. 10/10 since I would bop the bosses again. Momodora is a simple metroidvania. [b]The characters and the enemies were good but the enviorment was kinda bland.[/b] Most of it is this gothic-castlevania sort of theme, which is ok, but I didn\\'t find it all that interesting which made me not as motivated to explore the world. I still did explore to get those items. Combat and movement is good but there isn\\'t much variation. There are only 2 movement upgrades in the game which is disapointing for me, since those are my favorite upgrades in metroidvanias. Combat is most just run up to enemies and whack them till they die. You have a bow for ranged attacks. You can also charge it up for a stronger attack, but most of the time it felt like the lower tier attacks were better for dps.\\n\\n[b]I played on hard and it was still kinda easy, so I wonder how boring normal would be.[/b]\\n\\nOverall, its a [b]fun game and a mediocre metroidvania.[/b] Kinda on the edge on what to rate it. I mean, it was [b]really good for the first 2-3 hours, but it is kinda bland after that.[/b] To give it a score I would give it a 3.5/5. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a game as close to metroid gameplay as it ever got on PC. Additionally to boot, it has a great level design, very precise controls and a quite unique and refreshing setting as well as simple yet well executed art style.\\n\\nI was very pleasantly surprised about the amount of bosses and the gameplay is actually a lot more fun than it looks like. Well deserved overwhelmingly positive reviews. If you crave metroidvania, Momodora is for you. This metroidvania is also known as Momodora IV: Reverie Under The Moonlight. The experience feels just like playing this one other metroidvania, Cave Story by Pixel. It has a Dark Souls / Bloodborne feel. As you might\\'ve guessed, there\\'s three other Momodora games for you to try out, the third installment is on steam and the first two games can be downloaded for free in Rdein\\'s website. it\\'s pretty good It doesn\\'t really feel good to play. Be it the movement, the limited moveset, the lack of variety in enemies and boss attacks and other things. Most attacks are overly simplistic, the hitboxes are terrible (honestly my biggest complaint), and the difficulty settings suffer from a lack of balance. Normal is a bore where i can just run in and smack everything to death. In hard everything kills you in one or two hit, which i wouldn\\'t mind if the hitboxes and dodge roll made sense. What i\\'ve seen of the story was very barebone. No thoughts on the music, the sound design was neither great nor bad. Art style is cute and pretty.\\n\\nIf you want an example of how bad one of the boss battle was, it was one where you aid an NPC, and you have to fight some female demon that... just throws slow attacks that stop right before you if you put just a bit of distance between you and the boss. So you just spam your bow and move away every once in a while. I was bored to death. That\\'d be alright on a tutorial boss or something, but that was the fifth i fought (hard mode, which gives the bosses more patterns). Most bosses so far had 2 or 3 attacks at most.\\n\\nAnd that brings me to another point. The melee attack, partially in thanks to the hitboxes, but also damage, is so vastly inferior to the bow in most situations, that it makes me wonder why it was even implemented. Yes i know there\\'s a wonky stun on it. But the range advantage on the bow removes all incentives to use the leaf if not for reaching weirdly placed enemies. Yeah, the level design was nothing great.\\n\\nOverall i\\'ve seen people saying it gets better, so this review is prone to changing, but i don\\'t expect the game to improve after hours and numerous areas where the game still hasn\\'t shown me anything to write home about. I\\'ve played this game for 8 hours already and I really enjoy it. It\\'s a nice game to pick up and play any time. I highly recommend it Excellent graphics and music, and surprisingly large map.  Fighting doesn\\'t seem too interesting at the very beginning, but it gets a lot better.  Mid to endgame boss battles get a little crazy, in a good way.  Overall, very satisfying.\\n\\nIt\\'s a thought I have about games now and then, that usually just means they\\'re really good, but this reminds me a bit of Cave Story.  Excellent atmospheric Metroidvania. 100% Cute as hell <333\\n100% Tough as hell lol A cute, fun, and interesting Metroidvania, similar in many ways to Shantae and the Pirate\\'s Curse if you toned it down a couple notches.  Bosses were a little challenging for me, but I was able to figure them out after a few tries.\\n\\nI would have preferred paying a couple dollars less (it was 9.99 when I bought it), but I still don\\'t regret the purchase.  I\\'d recommend playing Momodora III first, since it\\'s cheaper and will give you a taste of what this iteration is like.  This one is a lot more fun IMO. What did you like most about this game?\\n\\nYes Canadian Dark Souls. Lose a Dimension, gain milk in bags. Beautiful game. Excellent gameplay. Very fluid, smooth. The atmosphere is quite charming. \\nThe devs did not just create a game, they crafted a beautiful world.\\nThey nailed each aspect of what makes this game such a gem. The characters are very likeable, the art and music are right on point, the gameplay is solid and addictive, the story is just right. I felt joy, I felt sadness, I felt involved.\\n\\nThe only thing I could wish for is an expansion, but I know the team is working on something new, and I respect that. Play this if you actually like video games. Great game. Excellent platformer. Some running around trying to find the next room to progress to, but the story and atmosphere make it worth it. Pretty fun game for its price, but if you\\'re looking for a real challenge start with the insane difficulty, not the normal one. I think this game is a little bit too short for my taste, however its retro graphics gives you that oldschool-gaming feeling This game (to me) was extremely challenging and a bit frustrating.\\nBUT\\nIt is by far my favorite game I\\'ve completed and beating it was so satisfying.\\nThe art is gorgeous along with the music, and the story is a really interesting concept that\\'s easy to follow.\\nDefinitely a rage quitting type game but you learn to get around the hard parts of it.\\n\\nIt\\'s really cool and I\\'d recommend it if you like side scrollers and games with a lot of secrets/unlocks. The two best things about this game are the soundtrack and the cute pixel graphics. I love the idle and fight animations of the main character, and the monster design is adorable (as well as interesting *cough cough giant anime boobs cough cough*). I played through this game faster than usual, and it was when I was really disheartened by video games as a medium in general. It managed to keep my intersest as well as keep me coming back to it even when I was discouraged or frustrated.\\n\\nI have a problem where I finish most of a game but leave the end boss in limbo for an eternity. I almost did that with this game, but I felt as though it deserved a conclusion. I came back after a year of boss-limbo and the mechanics and graphics were as good as I remember (and I beat the boss in like 2 tries).\\n\\nI recommend this game for anyone looking for a cute art style and slightly melancholy story, as well as satisfying pixel combat. Gameplay Review: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1459711187\\nStory: \\nOnce again, you play as a priestess on a mission to put a stop to the evil forces threatening your village...but wait, this is actually a prequel to the previous three games. You play as Kaho and are on your way to see the Queen of the land to see about doing away with the curse and such. You will meet a handful of other characters, some of which will actually help you on your quest. \\n\\nMechanics: \\nYou start the game off armed with a leaf (series staple) and a bow (with arrows). You have separate buttons for your leaf attack, bow, jump, roll, and item use. You can equip up to three \"use\" items and four passive items which have constant or automatically activated effects. Enemies drop money which can be used to buy more items from shopkeepers. \\nThe level design fits more like the second game, that is more of an adventure game where you explore and find items and new abilities (similar to a metroidvania). After the first area, you are free to explore several different areas on your own, meaning there are many different paths and events you can experience in different orders. You can find hidden powerups which will increase your max health or give you new abilities like air-dashing. There are four of these ability granting powerups which you need to collect to enter the last two areas of the game.\\n\\nAdditional Content:\\nWhen you beat the game, you can save to restart from the beginning with all your items and map data previously collected. There are multiple difficulty levels which the game can be played on. Bosses will grant you special items if you defeat them without taking any damage (best not to go for these on your first try). There are zero Steam achievements earned from simply playing the game from start to finish. All achievements are earned from finding secrets and accomplishing difficult tasks (good design in my book). \\n\\nConclusion:\\nIt may take between 3 to 5 hours to beat, depending on skill level and knowledge of the game (making this the longest Momodora game yet). The artwork and action has been increased dramatically over previous installments. If you aren\\'t already aware, this is the fourth game made in the Momodora series. The Momodora III can be found on Steam while Momodora I and II are free games available on the creator\\'s website (https://rdein.itch.io/)\\nThis is a great game and I highly recommend it to those who like action platformers with some metroidvania-like elements. Feels quite 90s, also qualitywise I. Love. This game. It\\'s one of, if not the most beautifully executed, low-res pixel art games I\\'ve played. It\\'s a polished experience end to end, with satisfying controls and an excellent difficulty curve.\\n\\nIf you like the MetroidVania formula and are looking for a tight, excellent experience, pick this one up! Playing Momodora, I came across the term \"metroidvania\". I didn\\'t know about the specificity of the genre. During the 10 hours it took me to complete it, I felt very pleased. This truly aims for the longing of playing that sort of game (in my case, Castlevania: Circle of the Moon). The gameplay is very agile, the art beautiful, the ambience provided by the music great, and the story good enough for making sense out of the improvements of the character. The bosses and minions are well planned and do test your attacking strategy and your control skill (and by the way, there are just a few neats skill, and a minimal list of items). I only remember feeling confused or without a good notion of what to try next (or where to go) a couple of times. The rest of the time, the items or the unexplored areas of the map worked perfectly as a compass. May be I should say that I felt a little frustrated when i couldn\\'t find saving points frecuently enough (in direct proportion to my sensation of difficulty betweens those points); but once I got to see the whole map, I couldn\\'t argue that there weren\\'t enough. I would recommend this game to anyone into that 2D \"metroidvania\" mood, wanting to play a short but challenging, fun game. Momodora has nice gameplay and ok graphics por a pixel art game. I really enjoyed playing but I do have some complains. It is too short, my first run was 6:20, way too short for a metroidvania game. The cover artstyle look so nice,  I was expecting some 2d drawings to acompany the interactions but there are none . Anyways the core of the game is well designed and fun to play it is worth the money with the discount. Cute little game which was well crafted and fun to play.\\n\\nThe pixel art and music are beautiful, the areas are well designed and immersive, the controls are tight and gameplay is smooth. Its challenging but fair. The game worked well under linux. There is nothing unpolished in the game and there is attention to detail.\\n\\nThere were only 2 annoyances: I had to configure my controller through steam which also made it harder to use the menus because I couldn\\'t select separate controls for them. And for higher than 4x window scaling I had to edit a configuration file. The perfect compact metroidvania package. Movement and combat feels amazing, the sense of exploration is just right, and if you want to scratch that metroidvania itch but your gaming time is limited then this is what you\\'re looking for, kaho is love\\nkaho is life A small gem that shines brilliantly. Great atmosphere born from the setting and music, smooth gameplay with fun boss battles, and lots of exploration in a fairly detailed world. Stuff gets cursed and you know the rest. I wish it was longer. \\nMore like this, please! simple, fun, not too easy, not to hard, short and sweet story. 9/10 would recommend. Don\\'t give me a life bar if every other attack is just a one shot kill. There\\'s also enemies that shoot at you off screen 2d game design 101 don\\'t make enemies hit players off screen. Also fuck the big tittied boss, repeating the same fucking part over and over killing her stupid little minion that takes like 2-3 minutes everytime. Just stop, I already beat it, skip me to the damn boss already. All I could ask for is if i could change the attack buttons to the mouse.  When using a mouse make things more free flowing when not bound to a key on a key board.  The art seems great but the changing of the binding bugs me to no end.  I say it would be a great game to me had it the ability to use a mouse.  I think it could be great if it was like deadcells with its bindings.  I\\'ve said my two cents peace out. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a cutesy pixel Metroidvania game with few memorable boss battle with suitable background music while you hack and slash your way to the next boss battle, which you need the skill to dodge the attack because you’ll be doing a lot of trial and error even tho the game is short but there is a few flaws on the game, the level design is alright but can be irritated later on, in a certain point in the game you have to go back to the beginning so you can go to the next area, you’ll be climbing a lot of ladder or jumping on bouncy pink jelly, overall the game is good and worth getting it.\\n Waifus wars This is a good game, but with a few flaws. Combat is skillful, movement is smooth and fluid. The pixel graphics are great and the aesthetic is gorgeous. The characters & art are engrossing and hint at an interesting world lore. These are the makings of a fun platforming experience.\\n\\nThe game starts out hard, but gets a lot easier as you unlock additional health, items, etc. Bosses had decent patterns and therefore tactics to defeating them. Total game length was pretty good at ~ 5 hrs, not too long or short in my opinion, although backtracking was a pain until unlocking the warp option at ~ 3 hrs on my playthrough.\\n\\nThat said, [spoiler]the ending is quite awful unless you unlock the true version by acquiring a certain item, of which there is absolutely no in-game indication (had to look online after being shocked by the abruptness of the \"fake\" ending)[/spoiler]. Not to mention that after beating the game with 97% map completion, I still only unlocked a single Steam achievement. Would have liked to see a couple more of these come along for various boss wins, item unlocks, etc.\\n\\nOverall, worth playing for any Metroidvania fans. Low overall time investment, plus price isn\\'t bad and goes on sale for $6.\\n\\nEnjoy! A cat is fine too. Nothing to see here.  Honestly.  I really didn\\'t enjoy this one.  I got a considerable amount through the game and realized that it just simply doesn\\'t offer anything lasting or worthwhile for me.  Everything about it screams generic, besides the art direction, and even that isn\\'t nearly as impressive as it could be.  I give it a 6.5 out of 10, which is better than anything else in the series, but that isn\\'t saying much considering the other games were absolute trash. A really fun game for the 4 hours it\\'ll take for you to 100% it.\\n\\nNot very hard, but they are very liberal with instant death traps. But it doesnt take long to get back to where you were so I guess it slides lol Fun, challenging game. Easy mode is funny though, instead of making the enemies do less damage or something the game just gives you all of the health upgrades in the game. Haven\\'t seem that in a game before lol It\\'s a fun Metroidvania-style game with some great pixel-art graphics and an excellent soundtrack.  I\\'ll admit, I haven\\'t gotten terribly far in the game, but it\\'s my fault.  I started on Hard mode and, somehow to my surprise, they don\\'t take it easy on you at all.  Who knew?  Don\\'t let the cuteness be deceptive, this game will not suffer sloppy play gladly.  But that\\'s the test- if a game is good, the challenge will want you to play more rather than give up, and I want to play more. Momodora is simple in many ways, yet elegant in all of them. The gameplay is easy to grasp, and the difficulty is challenging but not unfair. Maybe you won\\'t see you getting better at the game, but trust me, you are. The visuals are charming, and very beautiful at times, from the background to the characters. The music is great, but the sound effects can get a little weird sometimes, but nothing that will ruin the experience. The story is good and, alongside the ambientation, makes the whole experience fantastic.\\nThat said, the game is a little bit shorter than what I would like, but you can spend many hours with Kaho exploring the city of Karst. I loved this game and can hardly wait for the next title! Complete and utter trash. Frustrating because of garbage movement. Pixel art is cool but the 8-bit game design sucks. Game is obtuse on purpose LOL, it makes it more \"hardcore\". Truly the Bloodborne of the Metroidvania genre. More neutral than negative, games not \"overwhelmingly\" good its a 6/10. \\n\\nPros\\n\\nRetro pixel graphics\\nRelatively good control scheme\\n\\nCons\\n\\nSimplistic progression compared to other metroidvanias\\n\\nthe relatively good control scheme meets its match in instant death traps everywhere that set you back to the last save point... to put in that system you need absurdly good controls not kinda wonky ones where you can get 3 steps off a ledge before you fall\\n\\nNo real progression in terms of character power, you don\\'t find a variety of weapons, you don\\'t get many (really any) spells, you don\\'t get many (really any) ways to increase your physical resistance, you don\\'t get much\\n\\nInconsistent level design and rules is a negative, example given, water kills you instantly (off a dock, pond, etc).  Except where you go down a ladder and are underwater and can now jump infinite times.  Other times the same holds true where a core gameplay mechanic suddely behaves differently for no reason.\\n\\nLong and short, its an average indy game that has been overrated due to the retro hook it throws in\\n\\nIt gets a no recommend from me because frankly its meta score is well above what it should be and the flaws outshine the good If you are a fan of metrovanias with a good story line this is for you the story is dark and beautiful.\\nThis is truly a master piece i would highly recommend this to any one looking for a good challenging metrovania game.\\n\\nPros-\\ngood controls\\nwell designed bosses\\nwell done story\\nvery good art design and map design (even wiith the random traps)\\n a memorable story\\n\\nCons- \\nrandom spike traps that one shot\\n Remebered me of Cave Story which is the main reason that I bought this game. So far it is a really fun platformer. I find it quite hard (on normal mode) but then I am not such an experienced platformer. It helps to use a game controller instead of the keyboard. Gotta get back to the place that got me killed (at least) 20 times so see you later! Recommend? IF you enjoy these types of gaems then yes. It is good, the music is good, the play feel is good. Decent amount of items to play around with. Kinda short though. Beat it in four hours with 99 map completion. Got true ending to some how, full hp upgrades maybe? Its fun but for the length maybe get on sale. \\nNote, there is a NG+ after you beat with slight enemy variance and you keep some items and upgrades. UNfortenely its a pain to play through because the map is still revealed from your previous play through, even areas you cant access because of key requirements. I ended up using the map more in NG than the first plathrough just to try figure out where i was constantly.\\nCOnclusion: A quality game that is worth the time put into it. Wait for discount if you are new to the genre. I love this game, a lot. Its cute, fun, the art is fantastic. Really if you like games like Rogue Legacy give this cute thing a try. Game is cute,but a little hard to control.It\\'s easy to die,enjoy it. the control layout for the keyboard is honestly garbage at first. You need to completely redo it in order to get it to even remotely work. Also, I don\\'t know how to explain it but everything in the game just feels unfair and frustrating. Enemies are placed in obnoxious areas, the dodge roll doesn\\'t feel right, and the little shield/knife throwy enemies can screw off. \\n\\nYou can argue that it\\'s just \"challenging\" or whatever but there is a fine line between \"challenging\" and downright frustrating/annoying. This game crossed it in the first 15 minutes. Amazingly fun. Lots of love went into this game. Short and sweet. New game+ makes for great replay. Tough but fair. Pretty fun game for its price, but if you\\'re looking for a real challenge start with the insane difficulty, not the normal one. I think this game is a little bit too short for my taste, however its  retro graphics gives you that oldschool-gaming feeling. All in all this game isn\\'t innovative at all but gives the player simple and well-known mechanics and design. And finally if you buy it, remember one thing... ONE THING\\n\\n\\nthe spikes are the worst boss in the game, 10/10 would die again It\\'s a tough game, but it\\'s fun. Beautiful little game, great atmosphere and music. Controls feel really good as well. Quite challenging in some parts. Overall great experience! I used this game\\'s sprites for reference ^^ A big fan of the momodora series, Momodora RUtM is by far the best one yet.\\n\\n A fantastic little platformer with great visuals that really nail the atmosphere and character animations, with a great accompanying soundtracks though the whole game. Combat is fairly basic, but fun all the same, with various items to spice up the gameplay, story and lore. Enemy design was pretty nice, especially the bosses, they all had interesting and different attack patterns. I found the game rather difficult at first, but after learning the basics it got much more manageable.\\n\\nAll in all, I really don\\'t have anything bad to say about this game. Though I would wait for a sale on this one, $10 leans a bit to the expensive side. You smack a giant lady in the boob with a maple leaf 11/10 This is a pretty game I enjoyed it quite a bit. But as a personal policy I give all game has one hit death thumb down. Play Hollow Knight instead.\\n\\nThe art style/theme is honestly the only thing I really liked about this game. Great little game. Good atmosphere, Kaho is love. Recommended Bit short and kinda hardcore at first due to starting out with very little health (unless you\\'re on easy mode), but very nice overall.  Lovely sprite work, very smooth animations, nice setting and level design.  A proper Metroidvania game through and through.  Worth the purchase. Hard but playing as a cute girl helps a lot A truly brilliant game but my only criticism is that the sound track isn\\'t as great as I\\'d hoped. Other than that I can\\'t recommend this game enough Accidentally managed to get the secret ending in the first attempt.\\n\\nFantastic game, New game + adds a new experience. dirty. shrooms. Whenever you play this game, always remember:\\n\\n\"The queen would never hurt us\" Not worth the full price but it was a lot of fun, so buy it on sale :) This game is pixel heaven with difficulty curve that can appeal hardcore and casual gamers. 6/10, good for a single playthrough.\\n\\nMomodora 4 is a neat game colored with detailed, alluring environments and smooth animations. The music is just forgettable. The platforming isn\\'t fun, as you are slow and only have a small double jump to get around, with no wall-jumping or anything like that. The only platforming upgrade makes you faster but does not add any new moves. The exploration isn\\'t particularly interesting, for almost every optional reward is just another health container or a collectable ivory beetle. Also, it would be much appreciated if the devs would color-code the map so it\\'s easier to read. The combat versus common enemies isn\\'t anything special, but the bosses are pretty fun, with my only gripe being that they often have only two or three moves, which makes them not very engaging once you figure out how to dodge and punish their few attacks. It would also be nice if there was an indicator that would show when you can stagger the boss and when you can\\'t, since the timing didn\\'t seem consistent in a couple of fights. One thing I also liked about the combat was that the consumable items recharged every time you touched a checkpoint to save your game, which is nice because it means that you never have to hoard consumables because \"you may need it more down the road\". All in all, a moderately good game that would have benefitted from more boss fights and less walking. Yes A great metroidvania with tight controls and punishing combat. This is one of those games you should buy only if it\\'s on sale for $7 or less, and only if you really like difficult Metroidvania games. It\\'s, pretty short, and you wind up getting a lot of powerups really quickly, especially near the end.\\n\\nAs you can probably already tell, the art and animation is very good. One of the side-effects of the smooth animation however, is the fact that the controls are a lot slower and not as responsive as you might be used to. Thankfully all the enemies and bosses move slower as well, so you wind up with a game where combat feels a bit weightier. It\\'s also somewhat easy, since the moment you close the gap on enemies you can stunlock the common ones pretty easily. You also don\\'t always take damage from enemies except when they\\'re attacking.\\n\\nBosses are the exception, of course, and the boss design is, sadly, kind of all over the place. Some bosses are very easy to figure out, while others will give you trouble. They also will show up randomly, leaving you scrambling to get to a save bell after too much time has passed out of paranoia. The big boobie boss is a standout specifically because you kill her by beating on her breasts which is... something a lot of people rightfully narrow their eyes at. Aside from her though, there aren\\'t any other cheesecake bosses. It honestly feels like the designer wanted to slap some tits around and threw in that boss idea to sell the game.\\n\\nLike soulsborne games nowadays, this title has a vague gothic storyline that doesn\\'t go out of its way to explain anything, but the stuff that\\'s there isn\\'t all that compelling or interesting anyway so it doesn\\'t exactly matter. The title is content to ape Dark Souls style storytelling but doesn\\'t have an interesting or deep story behind it. It winds up being a wash because whatever lore there is is so anemic that you don\\'t mind its absence. If you\\'ve played any creepy vaguely Japanese style masocore horror games in the past two decades then you know exactly what\\'s going on here.\\n\\nThe audio in the game is... more or less a C-. The lack of a composer is obvious, but none of the tracks are annoying or catchy. Mostly you\\'ll experience atmospheric dalliances that don\\'t overstay their welcome. The game\\'s insistence on using NES era sound (pulse and noise channels) means you get the same rogue\\'s gallery of audio cues for most sound effects, including some odd choices like the deep \"gulping\" sound for ground rolls which sounds like a cat throwing up, and the absolutely ear splittingly high pitched Kaho\\'s death scream (one of the few bitcrushed audio samples).\\n\\nOverall I\\'m giving the game a thumbs up because it is a nice short game for those who appreciate this sort of game. But the rough areas are really really rough, meaning only the most ardent of fans will truly appreciate the title. From what I\\'ve seen, the developer gets better with each release, so Momodora 5 should be an incredible title. Frequent 1- and 2-shots, overall feels pretty unfair. It\\'s a shame because the rest of the game (art, animations, etc.) is pretty good. Momodora has never let me down as a metrovania game why does that girl scream so loud i mean come on shut up we get it you died calm down The game is good, but it is not worth the price.\\n\\nI have finished the game in 5 hours in normal mode without looking up any \"help or tips\", it might be too short for a player who just want to experience the game.\\n\\nThe story is quite ordinary and the background of this game is incomplete, even though I have played MOMO 1 and 2, it is hard to figure out more detailed information. The music is good enough, but the character of NPCs is kind of shallower in my opinon.\\n\\nIt is not a wise chioce for me to buy this game in FULL PRICE. Great game. It is short, but it has replayability. The gameplay and combat are good and responsive. Art and soundtrack are great as well! Beware though, if you\\'re a new player to these kinds of games like I was, the bosses will kick your ass. Don\\'t give up though. overall solid game, I recommend it. Yes, yes, a thousand times yes!  Do you like Metroidvania games?  If the answer is yes, buy this immediately.\\n\\nThis game uses a healing uses refill at save spots system similar to Dark Souls and the like.\\n\\nPS: Despite the what the boobs-boss might lead you to believe, this game has a serious tone and isn\\'t full of boobs. Great Little Metroidvania. \\npros: fun combat,nice music,responsive controls,nice unlocks and skills. Played the game on normal,seemed difficult at first but got quite powerful as the game progressed,almost too easy by the end but there are harder difficulties available and a new game+. The bosses initally seemed scary but with proper timing of the roll(roll grants iframes) they were doable and satisfying to beat. Only cons is that the story is very minimal and the length is a bit short (my ingame time was about 8 hours with 98% map completion). Overall it was very enjoyable,highly recommended to fans of the genre! You can play as a cat. 10/10\\n\\nGood gamplay. Challenging bosses. Overall very fun. 8/10 This game sucks because I have to use joy2key. A well crafted game. Pretty short, but the gameplay is extremely solid. I personally found that I grew bored, but I\\'m not much into side scrollers. I did find it fun for a couple hours, but I don\\'t like being lost. I must say i really like this game.\\nIf i had to discribe it i would say it is the 2d darksouls, kinda.\\nNot because its hard, but because there are some darksoul like mechanics and you fight bosses and stuff.\\nThough the game is good, it\\'s also kinda short. there is a story, thats all i can say.\\n\\ngood game 8/10 Honestly, Momodara\\'s enemy design turned me off at first, (Giant anime ti$$ies!!!!) but the gameplay is fantastic and won me over in the end. The levels are tough for sure but fair, the boss fights are the same though some of them do honestly feel underwhelming. Plus the puzzles thank God are not that stupid moving blocks around cr&p.  You don\\'t even realize your doing a puzzle half the time which is great, becasue I hate puzzles. Hate them. So, yeah, long story short If you like Hollow Knight and Darksouls style combat \\nthis is definitly for you. Plus the story is surprisingly dark. You know if your into that (I am). Fun little metroid-vania game with solid atmosphere. By the end it feels a little repetative, because there\\'s not enough enemy diversity. However, the game is nice and short and doesn\\'t drag on pointlessly. Grab it on sale and it\\'s totally worth it. A little janky at times, but overall real satisfying to get through\\nAnimation and art quality is top notch I have tried again and again to get into this game, but it just ain\\'t happening. The gameplay is dull and repetitve. If you want a  good metroidvania, go play Axiom Verge or Hollow Knight. Great Game\\nfantastic soundtrack\\nbest action game I loved it. It was fun to play and the music is wonderful. The bosses are relatively easy but you get rewarded if you try a little bit harder. Boy oh boy, it was extremely amazing 8 hours of gameplay. Soundtrack and art just fascinating One of the greatest Metroidvania I\\'ve played First off  8/10 \"A must have\"\\nFor those who arnt sure here are a few details that the game has a hard time explaining.\\n\\nMap is kinda like Dark souls where you can and will back track in a way where its all connected.\\nThough a bit of color coating or names on the map can help cuz sometimes you can get lost. Or forget what place is where..\\n\\ncombat is tight although some times when facing bosses hit detection is a bit wonky\\n\\nEven though the map is straight forward and its easy retrace your steps. There is no clear guide telling you what you need to do.\\n\\n* Thing to Note: The Story for progressing is only in hints giving from NPC\\'s, and the Item Descriptions. If you arnt smart enough to remember names or places. You WILL GET LOST or feel stuck and have no clear idea of were to go next. Which will result in back tracking everything. [spoiler] (backtrack to forest at some point) [/spoiler]\\n\\nAll around the art and gameplay are better than most pixal games and will give you a great challenge. Must get for platformers/metroid/and dank souls. does a great job of scratching that metroidvania itch A short and sweet adventure where you play as a priestess who expels evil by smacking boobs with a leaf. It\\'s short, sweet, and wonderful. It offers fair difficulty on its normal settings, and those looking for a more relaxing playthrough can rely on its easy setting to be able to see the entire game through. The playstyle is a fun mix of metroidvania with a little bullet-hell, and the art is adorable. Sadly, the story is left more to imagination and interpretation for most bosses and areas of the game; they still remain unique and interesting though. My first play took around ten hours of exploring and backtracking and such, but I definetly didn\\'t get to everything and plan oncoming back to this game again. Also cute anime girls. controls and mechanics feel so good Enjoyable and challenging, a metroidvania that doesn\\'t last long enough. Give it a shot if you\\'ve got the guts.\\n\\nDoes have some fullscreen optimization issues (I have a fairly solid rig and still get hard frame drops on certain screens), but not a problem in windowed. Great metroidvania. A must for fans of the genre. Awesome and entertaining game, just completed it and I loved it. I recommend to anyone who likes 2d games. watch out Pretty fun. Nothing speical. Honestlyy the best 6 hours of a game I have played in a while. +perfect length\\n+varied enemies\\n+cool ost & art\\n+barely any filler\\n-difficulty doesn\\'t scale evenly and the endgame feels too easy\\n-should have been named momo4a\\n\\nB+ This game play on hard for the first time is hilariously fun. Very much recommended. Being forced to understand the mechniacs of every fight and enemey is very fun. So far no mechnics seem completely unfair certain moves come out on pretty low frames but most everything is easily dodgable and counterable. My only blight atm is the forward movement on regular attack making postion much more important. Otherwise well worth the buy esp. when it\\'s on sale. This is a very difficult, but beautiful metroidvania-like game. You play as a priestess on her quest to save the world from a terrible curse. Your weapon of choice? A maple leaf. Yeah, it\\'s something different for a change.\\nThe bosses can be ruthless and even the common enemies may pose a problem if you rush in and hope to win with just swinging your little leaf. Thankfully there are a bunch of items you can find or purchase to make your life easier.\\nThe map has many secrets and there\\'s even a hidden (or extended) ending, if you find the right items.\\nVery nice spritework and an atmospheric music score only contribute to this great action / adventure platformer. The only problem with this game is it is too short. Yes A somewhat charming but flawed Metroidvania with serious balance issues.\\n- Almost everything kills you in a single hit, including normal mobs. The game has a health bar, upgrades, and refills, but all those are essentially pointless.\\n- Unskipable cutscenes before some bosses. You are forced to read through them every time, despite said bosses killing you in a single hit and requiring lots of repetition and practice.\\n- Melee combat is useless. Spamming arrows deals at least four times the damage over time and is much safer. The game seems to be intended to be played with a controller with auto-fire.\\n- Poor level and enemy design, with lots of enemies shooting at you from outside the screen, appearing from nowhere and attacking you immediately, etc. You are forced to learn with your death, which is always bad game design.\\n- Extremely poor hit boxes, with projectiles and enemy attacks killing you from a mile away with no contact whatsoever.\\n\\nI enjoy hard games, but there is a difference between a challenge and bad design, and this is just bad design.\\n\\nThe pixel art is decent, and the protagonist in particular has very good animations, and that\\'s it. Tried it out, very meh. Makes me happy I have to say that I really want to give this game a thumb up but I can\\'t. This game has too many flaws that really limit my enjoyment. The most obvious are the instant death spikes and pits. If you hit one of this it is game over, back to the last save point. Regardless whether the spikes are placed in a dark area where you cannot see them or they are part of a bossfight.\\n\\nThe pits are symptoms of the attempt to artificial stretch the games length. You want to move with speed throw a platformer? too bad lose 2 minutes or have enemies spawn from nothing right next to you or fight bosses with double the necessary hp.  \\n\\nA little something to note is the fact that the difficulty starts pretty much at 100% and stays at that.\\n For someone who never played metroidvania games, this game amuses me so much. I\\'m fascinated with the background of the game and the mechanics. It\\'s so cool for a game that mimics Castlevania. Well, the problem is I was going blind to normal difficulty and it feels like 8-bit Dark Souls. U shud evade incoming attacks precisely, or u got screwed up pretty bad. Even so, I\\'m liking this game!\\n\\nHey it\\'s summer sale! What r u waiting for? Great game!\\n This was actually a really good little game! \\n\\n-Perfect balance between 8-bit/16-bit style and new movement mechanics (Air dash/dodge, Rolling ect.)\\n-Good controls \\n-Great music!\\n-Cool little story\\n-Nice difficulty progression \\n-Cool set of achievements to shoot for in new playthroughs \\n-It has NG+\\n-No real backtracking \\n-I experienced zero issues.\\n\\nsolid game if you like this style! The game has been pretty good so far, I\\'m looking forward to playing it more. It\\'s got just the right ammount of challenge. Some of the encounters are fun and sometimes just funny. Like annoying a demon lady by smacking her boobs around until she goes away. Made me giggle a bit. The animations are a pleasure to watch. \\n\\nLooking forward to investing more time into this little gem. good Havent finished yet, but heard it\\'s around five-ish hours, so I\\'d say I can write a simple review.\\n\\nIn my experience, great metroidvania. Simple but tight combat - plays exactly like Mega Man ZX with the saber (leaf in this case) and small blaster that can be charged (bow in this case). The map does one of the main things I knock Hollow Knight for and that is actually being f*****g GOOD. The map records your steps as you take them rather than only when you reach a save point - JUST like Castlevania metroidvanias. Some might dislike the difficulty, but I personally feel that it\\'s at a perfect level because of the number of save points. \\n\\nI\\'ve been looking for a game that scratches my gba and ds Castlevania itch and this game does it near perfectly. This game is tough but very fair and I would recommend it highly. In short this is must buy,you \\'ll lift curse and becomecute kitty what else you need bought this game during a sale for approximately 0 money and was absolutely blown away. worth every penny This game blows all three previous games in the series out of the water.  It\\'s both challenging and fun and best of all, you get to turn into a cute kitty. :3\\n\\nThe game\\'s atmosphere will really suck you in.  If you\\'ve played Metroid Prime 2, it has a similar feel to Dark Aether.  There are many dark sections, but they\\'re handled well.  THere is an item you can buy to light those spots up, but even without it, it\\'s still very possible to see what you need to.\\n\\nIf you like metroidvanias and are looking for a challenge, Momodora RUtM has just what you need.  \\n\\nAbout the only issue I had was some vertical chop in the graphics when moving, but it\\'s not too bad and there could\\'ve been far worse issues. BLANK nice It\\'s worth playing. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an absolutely beautiful Metroidvania style adventure RPG that I would highly recommend to not only just fans of adventure/RPGs but to anyone.\\n\\n♥Gameplay♥\\nThough Momodora is a sidescroller it does not shy away from featuring a great combat system, melee and ranged attacks along with dodging, the simplicity of the combat is really what makes it shine. Momodora additionally does a good job incorporating platforming into this without it feeling janky or offputting. The player can also modify their combat experience through passive and active items. The game rewards skilled players by granting the player additionally unique items each time they defeat a boss without taking any damage during the fight, which is a nice touch and encourages skilled gameplay. The game is without a doubt challenging and sometimes requires multiple attempts on certain sections.\\n\\n♥Art and Environment♥\\nMomodora features cute pixel graphics that are very pleasant to the eyes. The game also features some excellent environment design. Despite being pixel there are plenty of small details for you to take a look at as you travel the world. Each area is also very different in color, feel and design from the last (albeit there are some exceptions to this).\\n\\n♥Music♥\\nWhile I wouldn\\'t go head over heels with this soundtrack, the music in the game does the job and is very suiting. It additionally does feature some sweet tunes I could totally listen to on the offtime. The world music feels like world music and the boss music is certainly done up to make it really feel like a boss fight.\\n\\nOverall Momodora is an excellent game, I think my only complaint is wishing there was more of it. I roughly spent ~3.5 hours beating the main story so its nothing long. However Momodora does feature some re-playability through collectible items and a NG+ mode that I will certainly take a look into. That aside definitely pick up Momodora, you certainly wont regret it! A very cute game ² Would like to recommend this game because of its beautiful artstyle. \\nDid not like the gameplay that much however. Certain parts felt a bit too tedious, not because of difficulty, but because of heinous mechanics.\\nEnd boss was meh. Other bosses were harder, which let the game down somewhat at the end.\\nDidn\\'t also really feel the ending (the extended one, that is). \\n\\nWould most likely rate 5/10 to 6/10. It\\'s okay-ish. Short and sweet, with a pretty simple combat and very nice doom & gloom setting/characters. Only caveat is 4:3 aspect ratio, no widescreen.\\n\\nVery fair price. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an absolute joy to play. This is the fourth installment of the series, and BY FAR the most polished of the entire series, the new art style gives the game so much life, and I can\\'t help but find myself coming back for extra challenge. I\\'ve finished the game twice now, both on hard mode, and I\\'m currently working on 100% achievement completion! [spoiler] Yes, even the stupidly difficult insane mode (1 hp? Really? Jeez...) [/spoiler]\\n\\nCombat feels fluid, and there\\'s enough variance of moves, attacks, items, and dodges available to the player that there\\'s always an interesting way to handle an encounter. Learning the methods and patterns of a new boss is exciting (except for one, looking at you [spoiler] Derelict Frida [/spoiler]) and the satisfaction of besting them is always nice.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I did get lost in the map a couple times, and combing the mini-map for the tiny outlets of unexplored areas can be a bit of a hassle. I feel like a big part of my complaints with the map would be fixed if the map was color coded by area. The map, and otherwise lack of clear direction at certain points left me scratching my head. But! Nothing a little extra exploration can\\'t solve. Storywise, it\\'s quite basic, but still enjoyable! I liked all of the characters.\\n\\nThe music of the game is wonderful, each respective area has a fitting theme that helps set the tone of the environment, and the boss themes are very nice. If you\\'re a fan of video game OSTs, might wanna check this one out once you\\'ve played it through. \\n\\nI give this game a solid A-\\nEspecially when compared to the previous titles in the series, Momodora: RUTM shines brightly. Definitely worth a play for fans of 2D action games and a good optional challenge. It was pretty boring and there were places where it is possible to get stuck. It has a nice art style, but the soundtrack wasn\\'t too good. Most of the level design was boring, but it was better in the exploration side for a non-open world platformer. Other people may be able to find more entertainment than me, but I just couldn\\'t get into it. Neat game!\\n\\nThe controls are good, upgrades are mostly what you\\'d expect, and this is a fun ten-hour Metroidvania type game. Running through the game later [spoiler]in cat form[/spoiler], there is a good degree of glee and satisfaction in how the character moves and controls.\\n\\nI would absolutely pick this game up if you\\'re into games like Ghost, Unepic, Valdis City, and so on. This actually plays a bit like a cross between SoTN and Valdis City, so it\\'s not bad at all. Decent indie take on Castlevania, but lacks enough meat to truly distinguish itself.  It\\'s a short, challenging ride, but I\\'d suggest buying it on sale.\\n\\nMomodora is pretty much everything in the trailer; it\\'s a 2D sidescroller in a Metroid/Castlevania vein, though much more the former than the latter; I hesitate to call it a \\'Metroidvania\\' because the scope is much smaller, and while there is definitely a degree of backtracking there is really only one skill that actually \\'opens up\\' more of the map.  The entire thing took me 4 hours to clear the first time, with no conception of where to go and a fairly large number of avoidable deaths.  Part of this is because, open map aside, the game is pretty straightforward.\\n\\nThat is, in fact, my first and biggest complaint: as was already mentioned there is really only one upgrade that changes how you explore the map (the other that MIGHT have qualified is only fully exploited in the final area) with a modestly convenient warp function that feels like a bit of an afterthought (it only targets one save point per region, which for places like the castle, forest and garden is decidedly less helpful thanks to their layouts).  \\n\\nOutside of those the closest thing to a \\'game changer\\' is an upgrade that makes poison damage heal you instead; thanks to a limited amount of slots for equipment a lot of the stuff you pick up will be used rarely to never.  Inexplicably, a good chunk of the upgrades are only available if you kill the games\\' 9 bosses without taking any damage.  In practice this means a good chunk of players are unlikely to see those items.\\n\\nI compared this game to Castlevania specifically; this is in part because the game is quite challenging.  While you do have a health bar, your leaf-wielding priest has the defensive strength of a half-shredded burlap sack.  Three hits from most monsters will kill you, with your only mercies being a (rather weak) projectile and a dodge-roll with limited I-frames.  The only complaint I have on this front is the abundance of insta-death spike pits, complete with offscreen enemies that lob projectiles at you and reskins of Medusa Heads, both of which are adept at puting you into holes.  \\n\\nThe controls are quite good, with the exception of your melee attack requiring a forward step that can cause a lot of frustration if you fail to account for it.  Jumping/double-jumping is perfectly responsive, and you maintain enough air control to avoid pretty much anything the game might throw at you, provided you\\'re quick on your reactions.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s no Dust: An Elysian Tale, but if you have a hankering for this style of game you can certainly do a lot worse. Titmonster. What a disappointing game.  I looked at this and bought it purely because the spriting and pixel art is beautiful, and it seemed good from the outset, with good controls and fairly simple mechanics, but man for a Metroidvania, this game destroyed any desire I had to explore it by about the third boss I encountered.  Attack telegraphing is poor to nonexistent, and enemies do a truckload of damage, so that you\\'re usually dead in 1-3 hits even from the most common enemies with instant kill surfaces everywhere and bosses that can and will constantly one shot you, again, with attacks that aren\\'t telegraphed.  Now I don\\'t mind completely unfair difficulty in its place, in games like I Wanna Be the Guy or Celeste, where the game is a series of rooms designed to kill you hundreds of times while you solve the twitchy reflexes puzzle, but in a game that\\'s meant to be explored, it ruins the experience.\\n\\nResources are replenished by save points and nothing else, so instead of looking around to find things, you\\'re constantly backtracking because you took a single hit and if you take one more, you\\'re dead.  Bosses frequently occur just in the middle of nowhere, several rooms away from any save points.  Just like the enemies themselves, the game utterly fails to telegraph its plans, which wouldn\\'t be so bad if you could flee boss fights and come back like in some games, but you can\\'t even do that here.\\n\\nJust a really disappointing experience all around. I know my profile says Ive only played this for 8 minutes. But I beat it on PS4, and its fucking fantastic. Got multra addicted to this andbeat 90% of it in one sitting. its so good, Im going to beat it again. Very sweet and simple metroidvania, with a wonderful anime twist. much love, very yes. I like how when you go against Lubella, the Witch of Decay, her boobs jiggle when you spank them with your leaf. Review - Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\\n\\nMomodora é uma série de jogos independente não tão conhecida assim por muitos, porém, com muita qualidade desde seu primeiro jogo lançado. O estilo de gameplay é o clássico metroidvania onde tem um mapa enorme para se explorar em uma visão 2D, com diversos segredos, poderes, inimigos, etc.\\n\\nEm 2016 é lançado para PC (a versão de PS4 e Xbox One só em 2017) Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, com uma evolução exorbitante com relação aos seus antecessores, tanto em questão gráfica quanto mecanicamente. Para quem gosta deste estilo de jogo, melhor ficar de olho!\\n\\n====================================================================================\\nComo tudo funciona?\\n\\nO jogador fica em posse de controlar Kaho uma sacerdotisa que tenta chegar ao castelo do reino de Karst para ter uma audiência com a Rainha. Ela pensa que assim, pode impedir uma maldição, que está se espalhando por todo o lugar matando várias pessoas. Afim de salvar seu vilarejo, você partirá em uma viagem, passando por vários lugares diferentes utilizando uma folha sagrada como arma.\\n\\nSemelhante a outros metroidvania, os movimentos básicos de pular, rolar e atacar são bem padrões.  Um diferencial  é poder atacar de duas formas diferentes, usando sua arma principal ou utilizando um arco e flecha para golpes a distância (este golpe pode ser carregado para soltar mais flechas).  Além de que, no decorrer do jogo também é possível conseguir algumas novas habilidades e aumentar a vida da personagem.\\n\\nNão poderia faltar os itens! Há diversas opções que mudam os status ou para ataque. Eles têm números finitos, porém, quando se é alcançado o ponto de save, pode-se recuperar todos os itens facilmente. Então, não se preocupe em utilizados, apenas use com sabedoria, pois os saves são um pouco distantes um do outro.\\n\\nIsso torna o jogo mesmo no normal, um pouco desafiador, já que é preciso saber administrar os itens, desviar na hora certa, saber pular, pois tem lugares que podem lhe matar de primeira. Bom lembrar que o jogo não tem checkpoint, caso morra, terá que voltar do último ponto salvo.\\n\\n====================================================================================\\nA beleza dos pixels\\n\\nSou alguém suspeito para falar sobre gráficos estilo pixel, já que é um tipo de arte que amo demais! Só que, neste jogo não tem como negar a qualidade que o estúdio atingiu, algo de encher os olhos de todos nós. Cada vez mais fica evidente o potencial que os jogos podem atingir com este estilo gráfico e, sempre está evoluindo.\\n\\nÉ impressionante como tudo é bem detalhado e isso transporta para o gameplay fluido e dinâmico, movimentos precisos é algo bem essencial ainda mais em batalhas contra chefões, todos com habilidades únicas, sem falar nos padrões de golpes (que também é de encher os olhos.)\\n\\n====================================================================================\\nUma experiência muito agradável, pena que dura pouco\\n\\nDiversão é o que não falta, para quem ama metroidvanias, com certeza irá concordar comigo. Todos os elementos que foram dispostos aqui dão uma boa variedade, fazendo ele não se tornar enjoativo, nem nada do tipo.\\n\\nÉ muito gratificante avançar mais no jogo, liberando os lugares do mapa, ganhando as habilidades e, até engraçado ver a evolução que nós passamos no decorrer do jogo até o final.\\n\\nTalvez o único ponto triste seja a curta duração, por mais que tenha motivos de replay, são poucos, não é algo muito diferente que realmente te motive (a não ser que tenha gostado muito, muito mesmo e queira tentar as outras formas de se zerar.) Na minha jogatina eu fiz 10h e fiz bastante coisa até.\\n\\nO que resta são achievements para zerar o jogo sem morrer, dificuldade maior, etc. Realmente gostaria que fosse um pouco mais longo a aventura principal... algo em torno de 15h ficaria muito contente.\\n\\n====================================================================================\\nVale a pena?\\n\\nTodo o tempo somos surpreendidos pela qualidade e variedade dos jogos indies. Ótimos de jogar, sem falar que não requer uma máquina potente e os preços são camaradas. Não tenho mais o que dizer após tudo que já foi falado, ficou alguma dúvida da qualidade de Momodora?\\n\\nEspero que tenham gostado desta review, muito obrigado por ler e até a próxima! This game is one of my favourite games of all time. The controls are perfect at all times and you can get to areas in quick time. It has one of the best story lines of any game I\\'ve played. So I definitely recommend this game towards anyone who has time to enjoy this great game! Simply amazing.\\nThis game is not only challanging, but also demands precision and practice, but rewards you with a sense of accomplishment at every turn. Quite literally one of the best games I have played in a long time. The art is wonderful, the music is perfect. \\nI have been on steam off and on for 5 years and never written a review, but felt the need to do it for this game. That should say something... m Check out my Steam Curator page, \"Minorthreatt Gaming Reviews.\" I have the most organized and extensive genre lists on Steam! Be sure to \"FOLLOW\" for more of my recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31339849-Minorthreatt-Gaming-Reviews/?appid=257170\\n\\nThe Short of it: Fun indie game, with stylish pixil presentation. \"Metroidvania\" genre, sidescrolling adventure, but far from straight-forward. Lots to explore, good controller support and smooth controls. Retroish =)\\n I got this game on a sale, and oh boy I don\\'t regret buying it at all. The graphics are simple but well made and detailed, the controls are great, doesn\\'t have a lot of actions, it\\'s just jump, attack and using an item and the music fits perfectly the ambient. Simple as that. I don\\'t like the normal price at R$ 19,99 but I got it on a sale for R$ 11,99 so I got a good deal for a good game.\\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but wait for a sale before buying it. good speedgame. Cute Artstyle, Fun lil story. it\\'s worth the buy Fun if you have an afternoon to spare. I didn\\'t hate it, but I didn\\'t particularly like it either. The combat was alright, but the map just wasn\\'t very fun to explore. And for a Metroidvania this is a deal breaker for me. By the time I got to the end of the game I was glad it was over.\\n\\nMaybe pick it up on sale if you\\'re interested. But there are much better Metroidvanias on Steam like Hollow Knight, Axiom Verge and Shantai that I\\'d suggest you play instead. Dancing in the moonlight, Everybody\\'s feelin\\' warm and bright Couldn\\'t get into it. The controls feel off I cannot for the life of me figure out why this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. The combat is beyond non-responsive at the beginning. I tried a controller, and that didn\\'t help, either. I would spam the x button to melee attack until the game finally decided to respond. I would sit next to enemies and watch my health bar get chunked away because the game decided not to let me play.\\nWhat a joke. [b]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/b] is the fourth game in the Momodora series, the second commercial title and the first Momodora game to feature truly great production values. It\\'s a metroidvania mostly close to the GBA/DS Castlevania games and the combat is somewhat reminiscent of the Mega Man Zero games, you get a leaf (a sword like weapon) and a bow which you can charge up for more powerful attacks just like the blaster in Mega Man. The atmosphere/aesthetic is similar to the Soulsborne series, grim, hopeless and depressing, with a tinge of hope.\\n\\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\\n- The graphics are really great. Easily some of the best pixel art I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s all very nicely animated and there are very cool parallax and fog effects making the levels feel truly creepy and sometimes also eerily beautiful.\\n- The same goes for the soundtrack. The score is composed really well, featuring both soothing and gloomy themes, which adds a lot to the immersion. Some tracks are quite poignant and touching.\\n- The basic gameplay mechanics are very solid, Kaho controls very well, she has melee and ranged attacks, dodge roll, air moves, as well as many spells. There\\'s also a unique ability where you can turn into a cat, giving you a small hitbox so that you can fit into tight spaces and better dodge enemy attacks. Unlike the animal transformations in other games you can actually keep using this form to fight enemies, you just lose access to your bow (the cat holds the leaf in its mouth).\\n- There are numerous items and upgrades scattered all over the game world, some requiring doing tricky quests, others stashed in hidden passages. It really does scratch that exploration itch. Not to mention that you get unique rewards for beating bosses without taking any damage.\\n- The story takes a lot of inspiration from the Soulsborne games and is pretty minimalist, with lots of key things only implied but never said directly. It\\'s often gloomy and depressing with some nice bits of humor strewn here and there. It never really gets awkward and is pretty enjoyable overall.\\n\\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\\n- While the Momodora games are known to be very short, 3-4 hours is still way too short for a full commercial title. Sure, you can play NG+ and collect missing items etc but you\\'ve already seen the whole game. There are no extra modes aside from higher difficulties. An unlockable character (e.g. that knight girl) would\\'ve helped a lot and made sense story wise. But alas.\\n- The difficulty is all about memorization. The enemies can easily 1-2 shot you, same goes for the bosses. However, once you know the enemy positioning and boss patterns it all becomes a breeze. I had no problems beating the 1 HP mode on my second run and I\\'m a mediocre platformer player (still can\\'t beat the true ending dungeon in Cave Story).\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s a solid game that should be experienced by any metroidvania fan. While there are some notable shortcomings, I still feel that the pros largely outweigh the cons. It\\'s good, play it. A bit difficult to start, but once you get the hang of the controls, it\\'s a fun game! Great soundtrack and lovely level design. I hope to see another Momodora title in the future! Hmm how I will put this, the game is very short but has a interesting gameplay, atmoshpere and music. To those who want a long adventure this is not a game for you, but if you just want a relaxing metroidvania game well go ahead give it a try. I highly advice to buy this game on sales but if you want to support the dev team go ahead and buy it on full price. I have nothing to say because this game is very short but has a interesting content. very fun 10/10 best game It\\'s cool. I enjoyed trying to perfect kill every boss for cool weapons. A solid platformer not too difficult not too easy, rewarding when doing backtracking while having superb music and a neat atmosphere. I started playing this game for the steam spring cleaning event and well.....I LOVE IT! I didnt think i would but its totally fun. I suggest playing it. <3 Too adorable. normal is way to ez, hard you just get 1 shot. add that to the undodgeable attacks and you have a shit game The game is pretty neat, well drawn, but the prizes after tasks are not rewarding enough. Cat mechanics are not well used, combat is not exciting (last boss is ridiculously easy) and the soundtrack is boring. I enjoyed playing it, wont lie, but it is a weak game. Just perfect. Chill metroidvania. Looks and sounds great. I don\\'t want to give this a negative review.  It\\'s a great-looking game.  I love the art and animation.  A few of the bosses are really cool.  The music is creepy and depressing in a good way, and the sound design is fantastic.\\n\\nThe gameplay falls flat.  Your character learns a few extra moves that make combat more interesting until you realize they don\\'t add much to the experience.  It\\'s a short game.  The storyline is vague (I haven\\'t played the others), and sometimes you have no idea where you\\'re supposed to go.  It just doesn\\'t make very compelling gameplay.\\n\\nI got it on sale so I\\'m not upset, but I wouldn\\'t recommend this game.  (Obligatory \"I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS GAME BUT\" here.) A well-made metroidvania that, despite it\\'s cute art-style, tells a story of sacrifice and death.\\n\\n+Beautiful art-style with solid pixel art\\n+Solid soundtrack\\n+Thankfully lacking in \\'cheap\\' difficulty; boss attacks are telegraphed fairly and so on\\n+Simple yet solid story\\n\\n-A little on the short side\\n-The warp system for backtracking left a lot to be desired; When faced with the option of warping back to explore the two rooms I hadn\\'t in order to 100% it, I decided not to because I realised it\\'d warp me back to the start of the beginning area after and I didn\\'t want to have go travel through it all again\\n-Repetitive \\'normal\\' enemies that vary inconsistently in difficulty you must buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a very nice game in my opinion. The controls are very good, and it feels very nice to play.\\nI particularly liked stumbling on some new locations and bosses while exploring, although the fact that the game is so short meant this did not happen many times. Also, the bosses are not all that great, though some of them look quite cool.\\nThe graphics are great also in my opinion, as are the character designs, and there are some very cool looking areas in the game.\\nI found it very addictive trying to complete the map, and I was very thankful for it\\'s prescence. I think it would have been nice if the different areas of the game were coloured different colours on the map or somthing though, just so you had a better idea of what is where since the entire game fits onto a single map.\\nAnyway, the game is really good fun, I barely stopped playing after I got it. Fast paced gameplay, great soundtrack and a hard difficulty setting if you want a challenge great pixel art style, overall would recommend this game if you enjoy 2D platformers. Fun game. It\\'s very short and sweet. Combat and platforming is satisying(feels like playing Zero in the Megaman X games). Gorgeous art and satisying sounds. [b]Story:[/b] The story was fairly intriguing. Not the best, but I was interested in more.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The gameplay is where this game really falls flat to me. The game can be quite unintuitive. It has some nice looking fight mechanics, but for example, the first boss has a handful of moves that punish any strategy. The boss was easier when I gave up on trying to strategize and just went up and whaled on it until the boss fight was over. I have heard it gets \"better\" when you aquire a dodge ability later on, but not by much. The entire screen flashes a very annoying red when you get damaged as well. \\n\\n[b]Music:[/b] The music is very beautiful. It\\'s has very enchanting atomospheric piano pieces that very enjoyably coincide with the graphics and tone of the game. The hi-hats in the soundtrack can be a tad lackluster. Some of the sound design isn\\'t very good however; the death sound has a very jarring hard cut in the music and then an average quality voice actress. It\\'s almost comical, and it sadly breaks the immersion for me.\\n\\n[b]Graphics:[/b] Oh man, oh man. This is where the game really excels. The graphics are very wonderful and have a very pleasing autumnal aesthetic. The pixel art is very well drawn, and the landscapes are gorgeous. The animations are pretty satisfying to watch.\\n\\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I really wanted to enjoy the game, because of its fantastic pixel art, and soundtrack. However, the gameplay was too sloppy to me. I was extremely excited to play this game, and it looked very nice and promising, but while I was excited to play it, the game did not feel excited to be played. I\\'m sure there is enjoyment to be had with this game; after all, the reviews are very positive. But I personally cannot see the appeal. I\\'d recommend looking into the game more before purchasing to make sure it\\'s right for you, and buying it on sale.\\n\\n𝟓/𝟏𝟎 This game is very outstanding with its simple, but complex story, an excellent combat/boss mechanic and an open world environment that tests your true skill! I believe that anyone, from people who are just starting to experience PC gaming or maybe being an experienced PC gamer should download this game. This game provides the right amount of fun and difficulty to keep you playing for hours. To anyone who thinks about buying something fun but challenging, definitely buy this game! If steam had a \"Meh, it\\'s OK\" button, I would be choosing that.\\nThe game in my opinion is not bad, but it does not deserve an \"Overwhelmingly positive\" rating. \\nHence my vote.\\n\\nTo put my review into context, consider that I speak from perspective of someone who:\\n1) Likes metroidvanias\\n2) Is not familiar with this series\\n3) Played the game on normal difficulty.\\n\\n\\nI would be hard pressed to point out something outright bad in this game. There are some design choices that I\\'m personally not a big fan of, but that\\'s personal preference.\\nThe main problem, I think is that game does not do enough of anything.\\n\\nI completed the game in 5 hours and some minutes, revealing 99% of the map. I\\'m sure there were more secrets to find but at this point I was entirely disinterested in doing so, with a guide or otherwise .\\nI will keep this short and go through the buller points:\\n1) Movement: disapponting. Metroidvanias make excellent platformers because good ones have such a variety of moves: dashes, double and triple jumps, wall jumps, wall slides, etc as well as combinations of those. This game only has the first two.\\n  1.5) So, yeah, platforming here is primitive.\\n2) Attacks: melee attack (that comboes up to 3 hits, but only on the ground) and ranged - shoot directly forward. Ranged attack is the most interesting one, since it can be charged to get different effects. But for the most part you\\'re stuck with melee. What I found weird is how long is the stagger time on this attack. \\n3) Enemies: enemies are okay. For a game this short there\\'s enough variety, although I think that some of the more interesting enemies are introduced in the very beginning of the game while and some boring ones - closer to the ending.\\n4) Bosses: a couple were decent but otherwise pretty bland. Two or three attacks, easy patterns. Last boss was particularly disappointing: for me it was probably the easiest fight of the game. \\n5) Upgrades and items: Pretty boring. Standard +HP upgrades. Active and passive items. Active items are either heal or +damage for some time, possibly at the cost of HP. Passive items are: get more money or more damage, possibly at the cost of HP.\\n6) Graphics: good, quality pixel art. No complaints here.\\n7) Music: decent soundtrack. Not something I would listen to outside of the game, but quite fitting.\\n8) Story: Pretty much absent. Aesthetic of the game gave me false hope for a good story, given us peacemeal, (the way Hollow Knight or Dark Souls do it), but nope. The entire plot take a paragraph at most without any abridgements.\\n9) Characters: Same thing. For me there were two kind of interesting characters in the game. I suspect, that had I played previous games I would\\'ve recognized these people and be more interested in them, but this particular game provides very little context to everything that\\'s happening.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you\\'ve played all the good MVnias already and want to kill a little time, pick it up on sale. \\nOtherwise, don\\'t bother. Huyyyhnnnn! Momodra\\'s challenging gameplay and cute graphics make it really interesting to play. This game was also much longer than I thought when I bought it. I loved it so much that I spent time getting most achievments and still intend to get them all just to get to play some more.\\nI definitely recommend this game if you like platformers. After Momodora 3 I was dissapointed to get a poor metroidvania clone with mediocre level design and bland NPCs. I was hoping for nice fast-paced adventure, not backtracking on screens that all look almost the same.\\n\\nAnd I really miss ghost friend that was in Momodora 3. Short ride, but I enjoyed every last minute of it.\\nGreat Platformer.\\n Before I start with the review: PLAY ON EASY! Seriously, the jump gap between Easy and Normal is more like the gap between Hard and Elite modes in games. I\\'m the kind of guy who can play normal no problem, but god, you get so far in this until a boss (at the convent) just destroys you easily. I reluctantly restarted on easy and it actually presented and interesting compromise. The difficulty was still the same, but you start the game with maxed out health, so it\\'s still fun to play but at least you feel like you stand a chance.\\n\\nNow, the actual game. Pretty fun. The pixel art is pretty good, gameplay is simple yet handy (a close up melee attack and a long range attack with some power ups along the way). The game is sprawled across a map so there\\'s a lot of retracing your steps (until you get a warp ability later in the game).\\n\\nI completed it in 4 hours, though I imagine that\\'s largely due to the easy mode and the warp ability cutting out some time once you get it. If you\\'re looking for more bang for your buck perhaps play on normal or even hard, but don\\'t feel too prideful to go down to easy, as, like I said, it gives a fair compromise between keeping difficulty and easing death counts.\\n\\n [b]”A beautifully accessible blend of genres and styles”[/b]\\n \\n[h1]SO WHAT IS IT?[/h1]\\n \\n [list]\\n[*]Momodaro: Reverie Under The Moonlight is an action platformer that seamlessly blends Metroidvania style gameplay with the same flow and tone of a Soulsborne game. Being a prequel to the last few Momodaro games, the developers, Bombservice, have sought to improve the combat and graphics which they have done with flying colors. Combat consists of fast-paced melee with Priestess Kaho’s leaf blade and ranged attacks with her bow. The dodge mechanic keeps players mobile throughout each encounter with challenging monsters and enjoyably difficult bosses.\\n[/list]\\n[b]STORY[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]The story follows Kaho, a priestess traveling to the cursed Kingdom of Karst to put an end to the curse that has spread from the plagued city to her village, far away. Following Kaho from corner to corner of Karst will require players to master the combat mechanics to traverse and survive this daunting task.\\n[/list] \\n\\n[h1]THE GOOD[/h1]\\n \\n[b]CONTROLS[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]With such a large focus on fluid and proficient combat the developers have done a great job of making Kaho feel and play well. The evolution of the Metroidvania genre with the doge roll mechanic can be intimidating at first for some, but through mastery of the system can breed some truly quick and creative methods of dealing with each level.\\n[/list] \\n[b]ART & MUSIC[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]The pixel art is gorgeous and breathtaking with many diverse environments to explore within Karst’s city walls. When paired with the mystifying, soundtrack and somber ambiance Momodora: RUTM creates a stunningly mysterious world which is begging to be explored. \\n[/list] \\n[b]DESIGN[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]This is definitely not an easy game. It’s going to require a mastery of each of the game\\'s mechanics to make it far and dive deeper into the hidden lore. The game does a great job of doing this by having each level/room be designed in a way that fosters creative execution. With save points being as close as they are players have plenty of chances to replay certain situations without being set back too much.\\n[*]Exploration is encouraged and in some cases required to progress the story. With many collectibles and upgrades to obtain, these out of the way objectives will test your understanding of the game’s systems.\\n[/list] \\n\\n[h1]THE BAD[/h1]\\n\\n[b]CONTROLS[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The keyboard controls are bizarre. I’m aware that they can be remapped and tweaked to your liking but the number of options Kaho has are better suited to a controller. Given the fast-paced nature of this game, you might find yourself fighting the keyboard setup more often than not. Please, please, PLEASE play with a controller.\\n[*] Kaho feels great in terms of movement options, however sometimes I found myself rolling too far, or air dodging too far and dying. This resulted in me having to replay a section for something that didn’t feel necessarily feel like player error. Again, the same can be said with roll length being difficult to feel in the heat of combat causing you to roll into enemies. A better visual on air dodge area and timing would greatly improve quality of life.\\n[/list]\\n[b]UI[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] A very small complaint I have is that the inventory UI doesn’t keep you fully aware of recent pickups. It’s easy to forget that you’ve picked up a new item sometimes, which is no big setback, just a slight inconvenience.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]THE VERDICT[/h1]\\n\\nBeing the lovechild of Metroidvania and Soulsborne gameplay, Momodaro: RUTM is a beautifully accessible blend of genres and styles. Buyer beware: it’s quite short, but that’s for a barebones run that doesn’t include the tempting “Good End”. The decision to have so many of the deeper elements of the plot told through the mechanics like the items and enemies you encounter is a great move for fostering exploration and replayability.\\nIt does really well with its gameplay, given it being a 2D sidescroller. Players won’t be asked to master many things to succeed here like they would in a game of a similar style in a 3D space. However, I found myself wanting more out of the boss fights that didn’t serve as much of a test of understanding and rather a checkpoint to get through. All this to say, the game isn’t blood-boilingly difficult but will take time for players to fully master and understand. For those of you out there that aren’t looking to sink as much time into Dark Souls or Bloodborne, this game is a definitely one to consider picking up. \\n\\n[h1]8/10[/h1] I\\'ve a few hours spent on this game, but i assure you it worth the experience, mainly if you like to play on hard mode. It\\'s reminded me of my childhood, on 90\\'s. Good Platformer. \\nWhat is not sufficient is the story, it\\'s not said on the begining, the developvers put some absence of knowledge about why the main character needs to meet the Queen. what is the purpose to pass through so many danger to meet a queen? Something has happened before, but it\\'s not said.\\n\\n\\n(+) good difficulty\\n(+) good items to customize your way of surviving to the end\\n(+) good pixel graphics ( not too old to be more especific)\\n(+) good sound\\n\\n(-) Story:\\nthe purpose of the main character to put her life in danger to meet a queen, and what queen, what makes her different from others queens, why not another queen, what she have to do with the story of the main character.\\n\\n+B --> because the absence of story on the begining, and more instructions about the bosses, that appears from nowhere with a name, MAINLY THE FIRST ONE I\\'VE NO CLUE I WAS SO NEXT TO A DANGER LIKE HIM, THE OTHERS I\\'VE MORE INFO. NOT THAT we players need always have a \"info feeder\" before we meet them, but the rumors would become more interesting. If you like quick and compact action then Momodora: RUTM is a great choice!\\n\\n-Bosses are unique and memorable\\n-Different enemies requires different approach\\n-Great soundtrack, my favorite is Pardoner\\'s dance\\n-Smooth gameplay\\n-Game rewards precise controls\\n-Exploration\\n-Various item combination for the players to experiment with\\n-Boob Slapping\\n\\nHowever:\\n-The game is short, took me 4 hours to finish with all perfect boss battle.\\n-Skilled players can abuse the hell out of rolling mechanic\\n-Boss attacks usually does not require a mix of jumping and rolling to evade. Honestly this bothers me the most as I like boss fights to be interactive, not just timed roll into 3 hit combo.\\n\\nOverall an 8/10 for me, kinda like hollow knight but easier and with kawaii waifus.\\n This game is amazing, the best 2D action/platformer i\\'ve played in a long time. Witch\\'s boobs Every game is Dark Souls now + The gameplay standard Metroidvania, but with a dash of Dark Souls. \\n+ Fair, fun combat!\\n+ Boss fights are frantic and exciting\\n+ Is simple enough graphically to run on a toaster\\n- A bit short (finished it in a bit more than 5 hours), would\\'ve def benefitted from being longer\\n- Absolutely loved the bosses, so why isn\\'t there a BOSS RUSH mode?\\n- No setting to 16:9 ratio, is always set to 4:3 (not a big problem tho)\\n\\nOverall, a really fun, though kinda brief, piece of work. 8.5/10 I loved every second of it. I thought it was a fantastic balance of difficulty and length. It\\'s hard, but it\\'s also short and sweet. One of the few games recently that I\\'ve genuinely wanted to go back and play it again immediately after beating it. Cannot recommend it enough. Amazing graphics and the only thing I\\'d say is a negative is that the music isn\\'t great, and there are a few sound effects I really don\\'t like (Cat Sphere) Great Game It\\'s short metroidvania game with simple combat, nice exploration and decent Boss fights. Recommended Indie title for sure. Bought this on sale as I needed a new fresh game because I have been playing borderlands 2 like forever xD I am amazed by this game, so much fun in such a small package, playing on a keyboard will take a little time to get used to, but I configured a cheap controller using a xbox controller emulator lol now it\\'s more easy to play. TOTALLY LOVED THIS GAME! This game is awesome, but its kinda short. You dont get any puzzles to solve or have any big trouble in figuring what to do to complete the game. The art is impecable and the story is rich. \\nAlso, you use a freaking leaf as a weapon, how cool is that?!? \\nBuy this game on promotion if you want some quick fun. . NO Only one hour in but already can tell this is a great game. Great controls, great sound design, great gameplay and great graphics. Playing this on hard, and got say, it\\'s pretty tough. Got a few one hit deaths, but just because I was being reckless. Think this is the perfect marriage between souls and metroidvania. Hope this developer makes more stuff. Again, this is great! This game is very fun. You do have to backtrack and the names are confusing but in the end i enjoyed it. There is very difficult option for those people who like working hard. I finished thier other games under an hour. This took several hours. what is this Reminds me of blood born and i love this gane i hope they make momodora 5 in the future honestly this game is what you would call a hidden gem. i have few hours in it and i still want to play it.\\nthough i really need to beat all modes but don\\'t have the time atm.\\nif you love 8-bit ish games this would probably be worth your time, and the combat is rreally fun\\ni rate it 10/10 would definitely play again. Ah, Momodora. A classic Castletroid set to the back drop of Bloodbourne (starring Little Red Riding Hood). What makes this game great is the smotthness and responsiveness of the controls. It\\'s perfect because believe me, precision plays a huge role in your ability to progress. \\n\\nThe pixel graphics are great and the sound fits the mood but quickly becomes forgettable. The game is rock solid and while certain parts can be difficult it is never overwhelming. My only hard critique is the length. Why does this game have to be so short? How short you ask? A few sittings should do and no I don\\'t mean all nighters when I say this. \\n\\nI haven\\'t played any of the previous installments and from what I understand this is a prequel. I really do look forward to seeing what they do next time around and hopefully they make it looonger.  Well this game is worth all the money and support. Go buy it or if you\\'re still not sold, make like the main characters weapon and LEAVE... Wow that was bad even for me. \\xad Momodora is a short but glorious Metroidvania. It it definitely on the linear side though. The game does award improvement, even after completing the hardest difficulty because if you beat a boss without taking damage then you get a new (and powerful) item to use and abuse. Fuckin\\' loved it. One of those games that gets easier because you get good at playing it. Absolutely worth the asking price. A short but sweet metroidvania game. It\\'s not particularly hard, which makes it a bit more relaxing than your typical metoridvania. A pretty cool story that is told a bit too crypically and doesn\\'t go enough in depth for me but I would definitely recommend the game, it has a nice soundtrack mechanics are easy to understand.\\n\\nA fun title to sit back and enjoy! Yeah I\\'ll give it a thumbs up, but I was a little underwhelmed with Momodora. \\n\\nMomodora has nice visuals, a nice soundtrack and all that, but there just wasn\\'t anything that wow\\'ed me like most overwhelmingly positive games do. The story felt a bit one dimensional, and the gameplay mechnics aren\\'t groundbreaking. I still enjoyed it though.  \\n\\nI give Momodora a fair 7/10. Simple and nice, it will entertain a large variety of people due to its simplicity and beauty. However, I\\'d be surprised to see people being blown away by it. awesome metroidvania with fluid controls and combat. Great art style, solid play mechanics and a classic metroidvania feel.  Honestly, this was a solid gaming experience for those who like to explore.  The feeling of a deeper story behind what\\'s presented is nice and the hidden secrets are not too easy nor too hard.  A fantastic play. Very cute short Metroidvania! A priestess who fights with a magic leaf takes on the baddies across a beautiful pixel art city. True Metroidvania, with a super adorable answer to the half-tile problem. Definitely feels like a small-team game, but has a good mix of difficulty and exploration. Love the characters, even if the story isn\\'t super clear. One of my favorite tilesets in any pixel art game ever. \\n\\nAllows users to pick their difficulty, and the difference is really massive.\\n9/10 A stellar game. Although of a length befiting its low price, the experience is well worth the pittance they ask for it. Almost comparable in playstyle to games like the Souls series - But in 2D. \\n\\nGorgeous pixel art, amazing music, great pacing between loot and boss locations and genuinley challenging, but more than fair.\\n\\nEasily worth the price of admission. I am running Linux so that may be the cause of most of my problems if your running Windows I bet you will have better support. The art in the game is fantastic, but the controler support on Linux is pretty terrible. I couldnt get my logitc controller to work even though I tried messing around in the config.ini file. The keyboard controls are not great. Due to this I felt pretty frustrated and died in within the first 5-7 levels. I feelt that it was way too early to be struggling against the game like this given my skill level. I never got around to even start the story, the game couldn\\'t keep my attention.\\n\\nTL;DR: The graphics looks amazing. My frustration with the controls and hitboxes made me refund this game pretty quickly. A fairly short metroidvania game that can be completed in about 4 hours. the animations and art are great, but its length and story leave a lot to be desired from this overall kind of bland experience. Thats a good game right there. Nice, but slightly too short game. Worth playing. A lovely game!\\n\\nI got almost 20 hours out of it with 4 consecutive playthroughs. It took me a couple hours to figure out a control scheme that worked for me, but once I could jump and dodge without thinking about it, it got really fun. The moveset is silky smooth the visuals are smoother! Seriously, play this game, if for nothing else than the visuals alone!\\n\\nAs a side note, my MacBook Air couldn\\'t handle full screen, but it could easily handle 2x resolution at maximum quality. A super cute and fun metroidvania.\\n\\nIt is not heavily dependant on the story, but it doesn\\'t fail to deliver a good atmosphere coupled with nice graphics and good gameplay.\\n\\nThe only small lack is the longevity, but it still deserves a spot in every library. It\\'s great Never heard of or played any Momodora game before this one, but I hear that this is the 4th installment in the series and is regarded by those who know it well as the best one yet.\\n\\nThat said, I felt right at home from the start in this game.  The art and the music blend perfectly throughout and there really is nothing I can think of to complain about.  There\\'s some more stuff I could probably do if I wanted to really test myself, but the challenge of just going through the game, finding secrets as I could along the way, and finishing it was satisfying and felt wholly complete.\\n\\nIf you like games that look or seem similar to this title, then you will not regret the time or money spent on this one for sure. An excellent metroidvania type game Fun 2d scroller Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is game about a sacrifi--Actually, it has breasts(of the female variety) if that\\'s all you care about, the rest of the game is bonus content Very good game. Fun and challenging. Good music, mechanics and art. Has decent depth and just feels right. Recommended if you like plataformers and challenging games. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight seemed to me like my type of game.  I\\'d gone into thinking of a mix of dark souls theme having to be careful of your actions and etc, while contianing movement mechanins and some difficuly like Cave Story. (I know its a odd combinaton, but it\\'s the best I got.) \\n\\nAfter playing a small portion of the game, imho, my expectations were for the most part correct.  The only and main reasons I stopped playing is because of there poor stage design in combination with no auto saves.   Really, I wouldn\\'t care if it were just the stage design, but constantly loosing my progress from factors I couldn\\'t possibly know about gets rather irritating.  Especially after a boss, like why can\\'t it at least auto save after a boss! \\n\\nI\\'d honestly like to give this game another chance, but I\\'m just uncertain at this point if I should.  Is the whole game going to be like this?  Is it going to be easier, or at least going to give me more of a chance down the road? \\n\\nThough hey, aside from the above mentioned, I do believe it is a solid game and I do love the art style.  I just need some motive to try the game out again.  -w-\\n\\n(If I do end up enjoying the game,  I\\'ll chage this to a positive review.) :) Damn i played this game a while ago but looking though my library and seeing this reminded me how fun th 6h playthough was. highly recomend this. Difficulty is unballanced, combat mechanics are clunky and not much variation, the enemy moves fast and attacks fast, outspeeds us in general, badly designed bosses.\\nor dunno I just dislike the combat in general. An excellent game, challenging and fun throughout. Very pleasant graphics and music, nice controls and well balanced game play. I strongly recommend this game. Solid metroidvania with multiple difficulties, NG+, two endings, cool graphics, and a decent musical score. Combat and controls are tight, platforming sections are well designed, map layout is large enough to explore but small enough to memorize. Can defintely be a challenge on the Insane (1 HKO) mode. Highly reccomended to fans of SoTN, Hollow Knight, and other metroidvanias. It\\'s the dark souls of dark souls jokes Challenging. Loved that I never beat a single boss on the first try (I played hard mode). Some cool moves and upgrades, although I was hoping for more in that department. Still, I\\'d rather have that than easy boss fights. A very nice 2D platformer that feels like a mixture of Dark Souls and Castlevania. 100% would slap the boobs of the giant witch with my leaf again! This game is really good, but I heavily reccomend you play with a controller if you\\'re not a big keyboard enthusiast \\n\\nBut this game will test you, it will fucking test you until you feel like you\\'re going to crack your controller in fucking two (hey maybe that\\'ll finally get you co-op) . But that\\'s just a price you have to pay when playing these kind of hard games\\n Pros :\\n- Short, but still takes a little time to complete\\n- Style is really cool \\n- Characters are fun\\n- Very similar to Hollow Knight, not counting length\\n- Very reasonable price (especially if on sale)\\n- Boss fights are really fun and none of them were overly annoying\\n\\nCons :\\n- Some people might find this game a bit too short\\n- Controls can be a little annoying sometimes, but usually it\\'s ok\\n- Story isn\\'t the best thing I\\'ve seen, but other aspects make up for it\\n\\nIn short, if you are looking for a short little adventure that might last you a couple days and is more focused on the gameplay and characters than the story, this is the game for you. Little gem I found on youtube. In terms of content it\\'s short and flat, but charming throughout. LOTS of backtracking required. I got lost several times and wasted hours looking for the right path.\\n\\nWould recommend A lot of effort put in to the graphic design and the combat is also smooth. Well done guys. This game feels like binge watching an anime while drunk;it\\'s a short,sweet and exciting experience which seems to be devoid of male presence, except for one character. The game\\'s presentation is top notch,having a pleasant pixel art style, featuring beautiful and unique theme and execution for each of its zones,all of them featuring tiny details which give the world a living,breathing feel.The soundtrack is good,mostly helping to strengthen the atmosphere, but also pumping up on certain boss fights to ringle your tingle. The gameplay is simple and very fun,giving the player both mobility and versatility. Your forms of attack are a three stage ground combo with a aerial;and a bow with 3 main scaling charge shots,with a 4th one rewarded after defeating a certain boss.In the movement department you have a base ground roll and a aerial dodge earned after defeating a certain boss,accompanied by an innate double jump and a swift movement speed.There are also collectaible items which have different benefits and can drastically influence your gameplay style.The level layout is well executed, generating some interesting situations with the enemy placements. But the bread and butter of the game are the 10ish boss battles, all of them having multiple ways of tackling and a plethora of attacks to dodge.After the second boss,the player can tackle the following three bosses in any way they desire,each beih located in a separate area of the map.The story of the game is sufficient enough to keep you playing while also having some tiny side arks which complete the bleak feel of the gameworld.Overall a pleasant experience with a tricky difficulty which never feels frustrating or unfair. Somewhere between dark souls castlevania metroid This is a gem, BUY IT!!!!!! Incredibly fun game. It is relatively short, it should only take roughly 2-3 hours to complete if you intend to finish it at once. Despite this, it is worth every penny that it cost. Gameplay is a reminiscent of the Dark Souls games and captures some of the best essence from those games such as the fun boss battles, puzzle-like maps, dark and creative story, and not to mention the epic music. Awesome game, I absolutely loved every minute of it 10/10 would and have played again. Did someone say Dark Souls 4? (jk)\\n\\nExpect to get frustrated at some of the bosses, it\\'s a hard game but a really good one tho. Quite simply put, if you like Metroidvanias, you\\'ll like this. It was hard at first. But some of that was due to me being used to Dead Cells and being used to rolls being able to cancel any other actions at any time.\\nSo whenever roll\\'s off cooldown, you could use it.\\n\\nHere while in attack animation, you can\\'t cancel it with a roll. \\nIt was a very pleasant experience! It was fun to be able to finish a game and get the true ending in just a few days.\\nNo artificial padding was nice.\\nI liked the visuals a lot. Beautiful pixel graphics. It was an inspiring game.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s not the longest game ever, it\\'s an experience I\\'d gladly recommend to anyone. (And long games can be a bit difficult to finish for some people. So this game should definitely be up those people\\'s alleys.)\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 9/10 rating. \\n\\n(Finding a 10/10 game is difficult since that needs to really move a person and change their life, hah.) In all regards i chalk this game up as the Secret love child of origonal metroid and dark souls. With astoundingly tight controls this game relies heavily on the skill of the player. the atmoshpere is drol and depressing and is a perfect fit for the context and setting. If your looking for a challenge and a call back to older platformers this is the game for you. 8/10 10/10 you can turn into a cat. Controls are tight and responsive, boss fights are amazing and interesting (My favorite fight so far is against Pardoner Fennel). The game isn\\'t too easy while also being not too hard. Rarely when I die do I feel cheated, its my fault like 99% of the time. I just wish there was some sort of journal/log that told you what your current mission is, I\\'m just a bit worried when I reload it in a day or two, I\\'ll have completely forgotten my goal. There\\'s very little progression on your character, yet somehow it feels like you\\'re a lot stronger later on than at the beginning. Pretty much the only thing  I don\\'t like about the game was the difficulty of the starting forest area. I died there more than any other zone, so to a newcomer to the metroidvania genre, it might be a bit daunting. (Also the death sound sounds more like a dog than a woman js) I had high expectations, drawn in by the low price and amazing visuals, yet was let down by the lackluster combat and bosses, which had little to no variety in how you fought them. Roll, attack, roll, attack. It was so dull I was unable to play for more than an hour. I personally do not recommend this, and suggest looking at different metroidvanias. I approached this game looking to fill in the gap in my life after finishing Hollow Knight. However nothing about the way Momodora is designed is anywhere near as good.\\n\\nMy main issues: \\n- Momodora is incredibly linear. While there are some branches off the path, leading to some collectables, ultimately the structure of the game is just a series of platforming zones with the occasional save point, followed by a boss, followed by a shop, rinse and repeat.\\n- Momodora is unnecessarily harsh about dying. In most modern platformers/metroidvania, when you land on spikes, you\\'ll lose a life and restart at the beginning of this room. In Momodora, if you hit spikes just a single time, you die instantly and have to restart back at the last save point, often forcing you to redo up to 10 minutes of the game. It\\'s fine if the game wants to be hardcore and have an instant death condition, but forcing the player to repeat large segments of the game as a punishment is very poor design\\n- Similarly, boss combat is arbitrarily hard. Good boss fights are a puzzle that let you learn the boss\\'s moves and weaknesses to ultimately avoid all their attacks and defeat them. In Momodora, bosses rarely telegraph their moves, and if they do, you have no way of knowing if they\\'re about to shoot forward, slash at you, or teleport away, meaning you will probably take damage just because you lost at paper-scissors-rock. Also annoying is the fact that the attack button moves you slightly forwards, meaning that you can\\'t just stand and hit a boss without you walking into them and taking damage\\n- The game also has generally bland graphics and sound design, but I\\'d be totally willing to look past these issues if the core gameplay were solid, which it isn\\'t A fun and colorful sidescroller with great and resposive controls. Very fair. The music is atmospheric and has ended up in my ost playlist. fairly short and sometimes challenging, momodora is a fun metroidvania with tight controls and beautiful pixel art. \\n\\nit would probably take you 2-5 hrs to get through the game, but it is very much short and sweet. Excellent game, very addictive with wonderful graphics and soundtrack. smack people with leaf I am honestly suprisingly dissapointed with this game. \\n\\nThere were side scrolling elements that the game did not take advantage of. Throughout the game, there are boxes and barrels that the game let\\'s you destroy, but when you do, there are no munnies or anything in those boxes. This is a nitpick, but I feel that it was wasted opportunity to have that satisfaction in destroying the boxes and to encourage the player in doing so. Here is the other thing.\\n\\nA boss should be something that proves as a challenge, an obstacle that stands in your way, something that will not be an easy task. So that when you slay this boss, you feel like an absolute champion that can take on anything. I did not feel like this at all after killing the bosses in the game. There were no rewards, no munnies that dropped, the boss did not fall on the ground to a huge thud--nothing. There was no satisfaction in killing a boss, it was almost like they were thrown in the game just for the sake of having them there. It feels like there is no point in killing them because you get nothing out of it. There are a few bosses that were a bore and have very repetitive patterns, but I\\'ll cut this game some slack on that end. \\n\\nDo not even get me started on the ending to this game. To put it simply, trying not to spoil too much, the ending of this game felt like an egg was cracked into my ass and someone screwed it until it was scrambled (without consent). I paid ten dollars for what I expected to be a fun, immersive game only to be betrayed. \\n\\nThis is a very short game, it isnt worth the money, just go buy shovel knight and hollow knight and have a good time. On the shorter side, though one could say it\\'s quality over quantity.  Solid work!  Highly recommend to those interested in platformers, and maybe even to those not usually interested in the genre.  Be aware, while its not too hard, I certainly wouldn\\'t call it easy. Yes As I get older, I began to lose interest in video games and usually rush off to win the game not caring about any achievement or whatsoever. But not this game. I really enjoy every minute of it. I really want to hit 100% for the map and unlock all the secret. There\\'s something about this game that hit all the right notes.\\n\\n\\nShort n sweet, hope the next one is longer & contain more secret / easter egg. :) You can turn into cat.\\n\\nNuff said. Great game. Bought it, because it is a pixel graphic indie game. Enjoyed it tremendously. Cute graphics, fun combat, challenging boss battles, a solid Metroidvania. pretty good, im just salty about the true ending tho. Love It. :) An OK but unremarkable bitesized Metroidvania that I\\'d just about recommend picking up only if it were on sale. If you pick it up on sale, it\\'s worth it, but nothing to write home about.  It\\'s a competently crafted metroidvania. extremely weeby game had to die of sfx from above you can try to listen to just mad rick please squeeze hard when i was coo\\' the ship that was the guy obsessed with ton of your eggplant so we removed Pros:\\n-Play as cute girl\\n-Defeat boss by smacking her boobs\\n-Use Giant Maple Leaf for weapon\\n[spoiler] -Can turn into a cat [/spoiler]\\n-Second Boob Smack fight\\n-Checkpoint bells are fun to ring\\n-Boob smacks\\n\\nCons:\\n-Short\\n-Not enough boob smacking Excellent gameplay and level design--I love it. Probably the best entry in the Momodora lineup, and maybe the best Metroidvania game that I ever had the grace of playing!\\n\\nLike the previous games, it\\'s short, but holds so much! The story, the characters, the atmosphere accompanying it with an amazing soundtrack, just- UHH! \\nIt\\'s just so good! I suggest anyone the fandom, or hell, even the people who just geting into the Metroidvania genre to play this if you haven\\'t already, trust me, it won\\'t be a waste :) I don\\'t recall why I bought this game (likely as a happy byproduct of my pixel art binges), but having played it through to completion I can say it is a fun game. It is most certainly a souls-(like/y/borne, etc) worth your time. It plays quite smoothly, and the animations and sound design are nice. The length of the game makes it perfectly to scratch a minor souls itch, or to kick off a souls withdrawl binge. Great game, fantastic gameplay and awesome story \\n10/10 a really entertaining game. i admit I only bought it for the style, but I found it very nice also gameplay-wise, even for a non fan of the metroid-vania genre.\\nthe newgame plus features add a bit of longevity to the game(just don\\'t expect it to last more than 6-7 hours if you\\'re not the 100% completed type of player)\\n\\nfor the price, definetly a nice little game, reccomended.\\np.s. the soundtrack, while not memorable, fits and conveys the mood of the maps and bosses really well :) Transported to that feeling of discovery compared to Castlevenia and Metrod, but somewhat entirely its own style. The art is phenomenal. The sprits are beautiful and there is some really impressive mechanics as well as visually astonding graphics. The battle gameplay is somewhat comparable to say a Souls game, and I enjoyed that aspect.\\n\\n\\nI must say I really enjoyed exploring and fighting through the world, finding out how enemies behave, and the various bosses. Masterpiece Idk how it is in other difficulties, but I started out in Hard mode for a challenge. I got what I expected, dying a lot,\\n going between areas over and over, learning the bosses attacks to survive the fight, stuff like that. I guess you could say,[spoiler]\"This Truly is the Dark Souls of Pixel Gaming\"[/spoiler] A short platformer that shows a lot of care. Short game (3.5 hours) with excellent gameplay and intriguing world. I like the accessories and items system. The story leaves a lot to be desired, but that\\'s not what platformers are really for. Great game, but I would wait for a sale to get your money\\'s worth. Great metroidvania type platformer. Can be a bit difficult at times but that\\'s part of it\\'s charm. Adorable art style and solid mechanics hooked me. Wonderful game. About 5-6 hours long. Paid £4 for it (because I\\'m cheap), well worth it. Has replayability. This game is incredible in so many ways. Going through and achieving everything you can just for the sake of doing so is a worthwhile endeavor, because the satisfaction of bringing it to completion is greatly expanded upon once you\\'ve finished everything you can. The storytelling does a good job, not just by dialogue, but by visuals and mood as well. Finally, the art is such a uniquely expanded upon style and it\\'s very satisfying how nicely it fits, given a somewhat cutesy art style in an, at times, gloomy and harrowing environment.\\n\\nOverall, a smooth, difficult yet captivating experience, which I cannot praise enough. ITS BAD ASS 10/10 would boob again Great controls, good level design, combat, bosses. great general gameplay design decisions. Everything is on point.\\n\\nThere are 3 Momodora games before this one, and they\\'re all pretty decent, but each one is better than the last, and this one is fantastic. There are only a few threads of story connection between them, so no need to play the others. (I played them all in order, though)\\n\\nThe world is fairly open. in that there\\'s not a lot of \"come back here after you\\'ve beaten this boss to access this zone\". There are some secrets you can\\'t get till you\\'ve gotten certain powerups, however. Exploration is fun and rewarding. There are a lot of items you can find and equip, though you can only have a few equipped at a time. And a few of the secrets are shortcuts, to make getting around easier.\\n\\nI also like that consumables are restored at every save point, so you never have to feel bad about using them up. And some of the secrets are extras, so that you can hold more. \\n\\nAlso there\\'s a cat transform item. So if you\\'ve ever wanted to play as an exorcist cat, this is the game for you.\\n\\nEDIT: this game gets _even better_ on a subsequent playthrough, when going for mastery instead of just completion. totally different experience on \"Insane\" difficulty or when going for the unique boss item drops that you only get if you clear a boss without getting hit Another solid game. love the game and the art 10/10 hi Loved this game so much.\\nPurchased recently after playing Momodora III a year ago. Really fun and addicting, and the graphics are beautiful. I like the franchise but the gamepad bug kinda ruined this one :/\\nif you have any controller other than xbox\\'s dont buy the game, it wont start. Very fun game with beautiful art and soundtrack! The combat is loads of fun to learn and even more exciting once you have a good handle on the controls! Graphics are very pixelated, which kind of made it ugly at first sight, but it does add to the feeling of \"old game\". The gameplay is nice and fun. Made me wish for a controller :) It may be that it\\'s this very specific genre which Momodora belongs to that I don\\'t like but that would be odd since my favorite games are Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest.\\n\\nThe story is nice,minimalistic and the artstyle is beautiful. Soundtrack is ok in the backround. That\\'s the good points.\\n\\nNow for the bad, which is mostly its \"difficulty\":\\n\\nThis game just uses the low hit points of your character and the high health of ennemies to call itself difficult. If at least they had interesting patterns or alternative ways of fighting that weren\\'t just \"let me spam melee/bow until that health is depleted\". \\nTaking bosses in Hollow knight as an example; there you have to carefully choose the moment you\\'re going to attack and you usually need to look out for moments when the fighting stopps, where you have to choose between healing up or getting a few more hits in. The challenge in that game comes from learning the patterns of the ennemies and how to respond to them, in Momodora you just spam the thing till their health is gone while the projectiles they send to you is so stupidly easy to avoid that you forget halfway through the game that there\\'s a ROLL button.\\n\\nHowever, the moment you do mess up one thing BOOM instakill. I\\'d much rather have a 10 attacks chaining themselves coming after me if it means they don\\'t oneshot me rather than one,easy to avoid attack that oneshots me just because it\\'s so easy to avoid usually that I just wasn\\'t paying attention and got bored from spamming. In the first situation it\\'s hard to avoid all of them but it\\'s SO satisfying when you do, and if you mess one up you still have more chances, both to die and to survive.\\nBecause of the boring patterns of this game and its unforgiving damage there are 3 things I noticed:\\n-The health bar is purely decorative\\n-This game tests your ability to stay focused when doing a repetitive task more than it tests your skills and pattern recognition\\n-It didn\\'t bring the same surge of excitement than when I fought bosses from other challenging games (Hollow Knight/Furi) because of the simplistic, easy to avoid attacks\\n\\nAnother problem is that when you beat a boss, your progress isn\\'t saved and if you die afterwards for some dumb reason (I went left after the witch boss and plunged in the water thinking there might be a secret and died) you\\'re sent back to the last save point. Granted the bosses are pretty easy anyways but I can\\'t imagine how annoying it would be if they were actually challenging and not those big DMG sponge that you just need to spam at for 1 minute.\\n\\nLuckily the game doesn\\'t seem to be that long so in the end you won\\'t get tired of it because you\\'ll probably hit the end before you just drop it completely, but as a Metroidvania fan I was really disappointed by the \"challenging\" part. Though if it\\'s so well rated some people like this kind of difficulty. Well this is a delightful little game.  Reminds me (intentionally I\\'m sure) of the SNES platformers I loved when I was a kid.  Feels sort of like half Megaman and half Castlevania, with a dash of Dark Souls thrown in with the combat evading.  It\\'s not terribly long and definitely not as difficult as something like Hollow Knight, but it plays very well and is just a fun game.  Big thumbs up. Loved it! Cant recommend enough, especially if you like metroidvania style games! Only drawback is that its a bit short, but the artistic style is amazing and gameplay is topnotch! Momodora never ceases to be an amazing Souls-like platformer. Plenty of difficulty and alot more content than the previous game. Alot of Metroidvania type of secrets to find and back-tracking to find additional items. Took me about 8 and a half hours to fully beat with 100% map completion. Tons of content for the money and one of my favorite gaming series!\\n\\n5/5 We all know why you are here, haha boob monster, all good and well.\\nHowever, the game is actually really well made. Nice graphics, a solid metroidvania campaign, etc etc.\\n\\nOnly praise for this gem. If you are into this type of genre, I highly reccomend it. Also. its only 10 bucks (or less if on sale!) so it wont break the bank either. Love the style and the music. Something I could keep playing for hours just to get the achievements lol I was very shocked at just how much I loved this game. If you like platformers then you should play it! The controls are very tight and it looks amazing. yes Nice game, short and sweet.  No grinding required to get the true ending.  It is hard, but not impossible.  Definitely recommend for anyone that is a fan of sidescrolling action games. Really enjoyed it thought it\\'s a little short.. Beat in 5 hours with 96% completion \\n\\nStill recommended if you can find it on sale. The Gameplay is amazing, the story/lore that you can find is sad and cool, the dark souls influence works well, and the music is fucking beautiful, as well as the game itself. This thing is a work of focken art and deserves to be played. This game is a prequel to other three games but you dont need to play those to understand this game. Its amazing and one of my most favorite indie games out there. \\nIts a short game, but it is\\nso.\\nfucking.\\nworth it. Fantasticly cute metroidvania soulslike in some elements.. mouthfull but I think that best way to describe its feel. I very much enjoyed my time with Momodora and look forward to another in the series.\\n\\nI do hope interaction with NPC\\'s and side quests will be expanded upon in the next entry, but even so as it is there is much to love in its relatively short playthrough.\\n\\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, love the small animation details as well as the overall designs of the characters and bosses. Lubella especially with her antlers and smile are just striking in design. Honestly a reason this caught my eye at PAX a few years ago. Quality Metroidvania with lots of atmosphere and nice art. this is homestuck? i guess...? what the fuck even is that? \\n\\nat least it looks cool \\n 9/10-pihnix, ok jk\\nbut srsly u should really play this game,the sfx was so amazing\\nHELL YEAH\\n\\nok\\n It\\'s kinda a boring platformer, filled with cheap bullcrap (Yeah, translucent purple enemies are so easy to see agianst a purple background), and it even has the indie bullshit ending where you need to pick up all the powers and then rub your face over every pixel of the entire map in order to ensure that you can actually get an ending that isn\\'t \"Oh, you just wanted to get through the game without doing all of the bullshit? Guess your ending is you lose. Good Day.\"\\n\\nFrag, whatever happened to having a normal ending, and then you can go through the Trials of Heracles and Thor Combined in order to get the silly ending? Momodora is exciting-combat is sharp and challenging, bosses are appropriately difficult, and enemies are lurking at every turn. This makes for a good game, but Momodora\\'s lack of imagination prevents it from being truly great.\\n\\nYou start immediate with a melee attack, and bow, a double jump, and a dodge/roll, and you need to make use of all of them to survive from the get go. While you do get more abilities later, I like that Momodora isn\\'t so stingy at the start. As a result, combat throughout the game feels tense and satisfying.\\n\\nWhile the gameplay is strong, the world and level design of Momodora are unimaginative. If you literally copy-pasted Dark Souls into 2-dimensions you\\'d get a much better version of the same story and world. Likewise, the level designs would feel at home in the 16-bit era. If you\\'ve ever played Metroid or Castlevania, you won\\'t have a hard time finding the secrets. Some of the bosses feel copied as well. For example, this game has it\\'s version of Ornstein and Smough. You\\'ll know it when you see it.\\n\\nMomodora is also on the short side for a game of this genre. I beat it in under 5 hours even with doing most of the side content, and to be honest, I would have liked a bit more. Still, overall I enjoyed Momodora, and if you like these kinds of games, you most likely will too. Distinct areas that you backtrack through Castlevania style and slow paced dodge-heavy combat that\\'s accessible while also punishing. +1. also it\\'s super cute I really can\\'t find any negatives, this game is fun, challenging, and beautiful Short but sweet, good gameplay, interesting boss fights and very good music.\\nI would wait for it to go on sale though. Short but sweet (?)\\n\\nIf you\\'re playing on the side, got just a spare hour or two and you like the genre, then this is for you!\\nChecks all artistic checkboxes and will probably keep you entertained for multiple playthroughs if you\\'re an achievement hunter.\\n\\nAt this time, I haven\\'t played (nor own) other Momodora games so I\\'m not sure if there\\'s more lore or if you\\'d miss something. There\\'s also at least 2 endings one of which is -if you\\'re not \"ready\" with the right items- BAD, go unprepared, you\\'ll get the BAD one. To get the True ending which is also an achievement, you need to go hunting for some secret items, luckily there are few guides to help you get everything.\\n\\nNot much else to say that I enjoyed playing this game, it scratchs a special type of itch :) Fennel. Great game with great feel to it and amazing art style, could have been a little bit longer tho.\\nBought it on a whim and  I regret nothing.\\n Just finished the last boss in this game.\\n\\nThis was my first playthrough of the game on hard difficulty.\\n\\nI loved it. Absolutely was blown away. The plaforming feels accurate and rewarding, there\\'s plenty of secrets and customization to the way you play. The combat is ridiculously fluid with a combo system. The enemies are varied and ramped up the difficulty as you go alot but without falling into artificial difficulty pits. Everything seems daunting but is entirely doable once you learn the area. The bosses can be cheesed in some cases but are hard and punishing enough that even one slip up trying to cheese them spells death. Truely souls-like with checkpoints, resetting enemies, losing progress on death, hard bosses, etc. The art, holy crap the art. \\n\\nOverall a fantastic game. \\n13/10 would slap spectral dogs with a leaf again ... I have to play the other 3 games now \\'-\\'\\nWould play agian (if I didn\\'t have everything) Really great game, it has a lot of great ideas and the graphics look fantastic, the only downside is that is a little short, it think i finished my first playthrough on around 4-5 hours, but anyway, it is still good. [h1]Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight.[/h1]\\n    [i]- By: The Incredible Nurse[/i]\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a short but fun 2-D action/platformer game. This game bill itself as a Metroidvania, and let me tell you, it hits the right spots along the journey. Even though it will never be at the same level as the true clasics of the genre, for such a small team, they acomplish so much, this game was made after all, almost by just one person \"rdein\".The game enchantes the player with a great artstyle, fantastic sound design, and tight gameplay. The main character Kaho has at her disposal her \"blessed leaf\" (main melee weapon) and her trusty bow and arrow (secondary long range weapon); these two weapons combined with a variety of items, both offensive and for healing or status boosting, create the posibility for varied gameplay stiles.\\n\\nThe game takes you into different areas, each unique and more decaying than the one before. As per the other games in the genre, the exploration is a paramount part of the experience, and after the mid-game, the player is able to tackle the upcoming challenges in any order desired. I have to say the atmosphere is very reminiscent of that of Dark Souls, it feels like you are playing in a world that has fallen apart, hope has left most peoples hearts, and you find all kinds of changed environment and creatures. The whole thing feels oppresive and intriguing in a good way, and part of the story is told through the visuals. \\n\\nIn summary, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a fantastic hiden gemel that is well deserving of your time. Dive in and give this game a chance.\\n Great soundtrack, great gameplay, great controls, and great game. Definitely would recommend. A cute little metroidvania with a somewhat grim/dark tone. The game is well polished and there are enough and interesting secrets around. The music succeeds to set a fitting atmosphere to your current location in game. Momodora is quite simple in terms of how you can customize your attack. Though the game is short I felt a freedom while exploring, like the game could be completed with different routes. I spent a long time looking at this game before I finally decided to buy it. I finished my first play through in roughly 5 hours, and my only regret is that I didn\\'t buy it sooner. This is an excelent metroidvania type game, solid controls, a nice art style, and a blast to play. After beating the game, I was given the option to play through a second time with some changes. I haven\\'t started that second play through yet, so I can\\'t say what the changes are, but this game is great and definitly worth a purchase.\\n\\nI will be looking into the games that came before this one. If the developers make another game in this series, I will purchasing at release. Good music and solid sprite graphics don\\'t save it from being a mediocre platformer. Good game! If Castlevania on GBA emulator was 10/10 this game is about 6/10\\nThis game is short and that is good because I am bored already at half way of the game.\\nIt a good game but not that good. If you like it you will like it. Relatively short metroidvania with some dark soulsy elements. I had great fun playing through this. Combat feels good, bosses are memorable and not annoying. You can play as a cat. I\\'d recommend it to anyone who likes metroidvanias. Cool and Good\\n\\n10/10 More than anything else the atmosphere pulled me in. But that wouldn\\'t have been done without the great art detail, music, and feel of combat/movement. That is the strength of this game.\\n\\nFrom a game mechanic point of view, the \"dark souls / metroidvania\" structure of this was a good fit for all the artwork and charecters you put into this game. I kept thinking that all the heart containers and bellflowers I was getting would tip the game into being too easy but the bosses had a good difficulty curve to them.  I appechiated the platforming exercises towards the end as well.\\n\\nThe only problem is that I simply want more of the game. Not so much gameplay, but more of this world to see or better understand. The game has harder modes but if I play again it\\'ll be to \"visit\" because the places and the people are interesting, not to challenge myself. Very nice albeit short metroidvania. Clearing everything takes about 3 or 4 hours, but the experience is well worth game\\'s price. idunno man i feel like you could just get hollow knight, worth the extra 5 bucks [h1]Cute Bite-sized Platformer That Shouldn\\'t Be Under-estimated[/h1]\\n\\nAs a sucker for pixel art and platformers, Momodora IV was a no-brainer for me. I left it for a year or so until finally starting it, I do say I am VERY impressed. It has a very cute art style and gameplay is precise, tight and challenging.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\\n\\nThe game is pretty hard but is always fair. Never feels cheap but I\\'m not gonna say its a cakewalk. I usually struggle with games on higher difficulties but Momodora IV was honestly not too stressful besides one particular boss fight which I\\'ll admit was a ridiculous difficulty spike. Even then I still didn\\'t feel I was cheated or entirely overwhelmed.\\n\\nOverall I felt the difficulty really is one of the most memorable parts of Momodora. Besting a hard fight always feels good. The gameplay in general is fast paced, simple to play and kinda reminds me of Dark Souls with all the dodging and care needing to be taken.\\n\\nI also loved how being a Metroidvania, you could tackle the 4 crests/bosses in any order if you know your way around and there is some great hidden goodies!\\n\\n9/10\\n\\n[b]Presentation[/b]\\n\\nI loooooove pixel art! Momodora really scratches that itch. Not very HD but that is where the charm comes in! Simple yet effective. I love the gothic-style world and I especially loved the Cinders and Memorial Park. Story isn\\'t too bad, typical platformer story albeit darker.\\n\\nThe characters are cute, you have Kaho, bosses like Fennel and the huge Giantess where her boobies are her weakspot (lol).\\n\\n10/10\\n\\n[b]Overall[/b]\\n\\nGet it if you love a good challenge and anime-style charm. I would wholeheartedly recommend it even if you don\\'t like the former with Easy mode which I haven\\'t tried but I believe it should be a nice break.\\n\\n9/10 One of the better metroidvanias out there. It doesn\\'t show because I played it offline but the game is about 6-8 hours long, and almost none of that time I was bored. The art in this game is beautiful and the gameplay is crisp. Solid 8/10 from me, definitely worth the money. The game is good, a lot, but this review will cover the bad aspects of the game.\\n\\n- Landscapes feel a little uninspired, especially mid-game\\n- The map is pretty much useless, cause it\\'s only red and only points bells but not bosses\\n- The only hard part of the game is going to the bosses, normal enemies are fuckin WW2 soldiers while bosses are pretty easy since they only have like 3-4 moves\\n- Controls are smooth, but movements feel a little slippery, especially when trying to do some cool platforming and slip to the beginning of the room\\n- Some points in the game are just painfully designed to be EXTREMELY hard for pacifist run\\n\\nWhere\\'s Momo? Where\\'s Dora? 7/10 If you like the classic Metroidvania kind of games, then this game will give you the taste of something good. Biggest problem was I beat this in one sitting. It was pretty challenging at first but after a while it became second nature. The real challange is in the achievements. The pacificst achievement and no damage achievement are difficult on their own. BUT Id like to challanege YOU TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!! Short and sweet Metroidvania. With thight, respondise controls and a somber but cute athmosphere to match.\\n Fantastic game. I really enjoyed the challange. The movement and attacking feels super fluid and nice. Best feeling platformer on steam, 2d darksouls perfected. This game was great. I\\'ve speant so much time playing it just to replay it for fun 10/10. Controls are nice, fighting feels fair, wverything about this feels great. This is a \"metroidvania\" game with dodging mechanics and an awesome soundtrack\\nIt has a minimalist but gripping story and will last you about 10 hours\\nIt\\'s definitely well worth the price and I can\\'t recommend it enough +1 I\\'ve never written out a review for Steam before, even for other games I\\'ve loved dearly, but this has compelled me to do so.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (abbreviated as RUTM from here on out) struck quite a few chords with me. I\\'m sure we all know of the infamous \"Dark Souls of ___\" comparisons reviewers love to make, but hear me out- there\\'s some credibility to the claim here.\\n\\nFor reference, my playthrough was done on Normal Mode, though I\\'ll more than happily replay on Hard and eventually Insane when I can find time to.\\n\\nRUTM resembles a Metroidvania in style- gorgeous 2D pixel art, sidescrolling adventure, complete with getting new abilities as you complete the story. But, it\\'s also quite tough and can be punishing. Enemies tend to deal quite a bit of damage. You won\\'t beat this game by brute forcing it, that\\'s for sure. The game is non-linear in structure- that is, a lot of it can be done in any order you like, there really is no prescribed order to do most of the game. You\\'ll find new areas and important things within them by exploring thoroughly. If you\\'re into the Metroidvania style, this might scratch that itch for you.\\n\\nAs someone who loves Dark Souls myself, this game scratched that itch for me, too. The high difficulty and incentive to keep going (in example, each boss will give you a special drop if you defeat them without taking any damage yourself), plentiful enemy respawns, and even a couple of enemy ambushes here and there resembled the Souls\\' games distinctive style- just transferred to a 2D world.\\n\\nBut enough comparison. The combat in this game is rather easy to grasp, with a simple 3-hit melee combo, a bow for ranged attacks (can hold down to charge), a dodge roll, limited healing items. Movement is simple and fun enough. Truly  a game that is easy to learn, hard to master. On higher difficulties, your health bar will be lowered- on Insane, in fact, you cannot get hit even once, lest you die. Be prepared to die a lot, even on Normal. (Or maybe I\\'m just bad...)\\n\\nThe short length might be the biggest make-or-break for some, so I feel the need to mention that as well. My playthough took me about 4 hours real time, 3:20 in-game time, which is quite short. For someone looking to sink their teeth into a 20+ hour adventure, you won\\'t find that here. I personally appreciated the shorter length, though- it\\'ll make it much easier to pick this game back up and give the higher modes a go. All depends on your personal tastes, here.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'d highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a reasonably challenging, yet easy to pick up/put down at leisure title. I adored it, and if you pick it up yourself, I hope you do too! Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight was quite fun!  My first playthrough was on hard difficulty and was a welcoming challenge.  Dieing in so few hits was frusting at times, but very rewarding once I figured out the correct strategy to get pass the difficult sections / fights.  And for those that don\\'t want to get steamrolled all the time, the easier difficulties are much less punishing.\\n\\nThe graphics were great.  I loved the art style.  The controls felt right.  Comboing enemies up close felt powerful and risky and the ranged shot was a good balance to that.\\n\\nBoss battles were a lot of fun, and the music for them was great as well!\\n\\nWould reccomend! Good combat, fun platforming, atmospheric world. Good stuff By far the best titel of the Momodora series. Overall a lot of improvement specialy regardings to animations and storytelling.\\n\\nCompare to the privious titels, this titel has a overall map structur that is split into zones there you can find a lot of hidden secrets and new abilities. this is great for exploring because you can also tackle the bosses in different orders and after beating the game you can also start a \"New Game +\" to look for the things you maybe missed.\\n\\nThe playtime is much longer as the older titels (20min-1h) with maybe around 3-4h for the first run and 1-3h for subsequent ones (depends on diffiuclty setting). \\n\\nThe games as 4 difficulty settings easy, normal, hard can be played from the beginning and \"Insame\" after beating the hard difficulty setting. Overall i find the game is very fair in all 4 difficulty settings, its getting challenging the higher the setting but lucky not frustrating.\\n\\nGraphic and Sound are very nice.\\n\\nI quite enjoyed the game and because it has improve so much compare to the older titels, I want to recommend it to all who like action plattformer. It is not a terrible game, but it could be so much better. It\\'s really flawed and not very engaging at all. I don\\'t normally play Metroidvania but the art was good, the gameplay had a solid core, and it was over all atomospheric. Pretty good game. Imo it has some minor controll stuff. Like the dodge isn\\'t as responsive as I\\'d like. You will only notice this if you are impatient like me.\\n\\nI bought this game because I remember playing and beating an older Momodora game. I don\\'t remember which one and it isn\\'t on steam. Oddly not many people beat this one. As of writing this review less then 25% get the true ending. very nice 10ugandanknuckles / 10spaget A fantastic metroidvania style game. There isn\\'t quite as much backtracking in this as you would find in a Metroid game though. There are a lot of splitting paths, but a majority of the time it\\'s pretty easy to figure out which way you need to go. I didn\\'t ever really get lost until a little bit later in the game, even then only for a small amount of time. The movement and mechanics all feel deliberate and the gameplay is fair but challenging. The atmosphere is outstanding, I found myself consistently enraptured by the sceneries and the music. I beat the game in a single sitting getting both the bad and the good ending in under 6 hours. I had no intention to play that long all at once, but it was hard to put down. Absolutely worth the price if you are into these kinds of games. Marvelous little platformer with some mild metroidvania elements.  I didn\\'t realize it at first, but if you defeat a boss without taking any damage, that boss will drop a special optional item.  Well worth the effort - it doesn\\'t require nearly as much pixel perfect timing as other games to do, and the rewards are worth it.  EIther way, I was frustrated at first with the game (as I am with nearly every platformer that I\\'ve played) until I got the rythm of the game.\\n\\nDifferent mechanics for each boss that weren\\'t too hard to learn, but wound up being a rewarding experience to defeat (especially if you could do it without taking damage).\\n\\nOverall, well worth the cost I paid when it was on sale, and probably worth the normal price. Really nice atmosphere. Retro Darksouls. Fantastic game all around. Really a joy to play, with engaging combat that isn\\'t too taxing, but keeps you involved as you enjoy the visuals and music. Simple story that was still fun to go through, talking with the characters and going to the nice variety of locations. As someone who grew up on SNES games, Momodora is a slice of heaven. I hope the developer\\'s next game maintains this one\\'s spirit, even if it\\'s not going to be set in the Momodora world. Defeating boss twice by slapping her boobs (and those got physics, so they actually bounce from your slappin\\') is insta recommended.\\n\\nBut on serious note, the game is not bad, but it is short and doesn\\'t offer much content. After 4 hours, I\\'ve seen pretty much everything this game had to offer except new game plus, which only changes enemy placement.\\nGame looks nice, but where it really shines is the amazing soundtrack and atmosphere it creates along with the views. You can totally feel like in Yharnam with the red moon in the background and destroyed city, or Castlevania with destroyed castle.\\nOn normal, the game is actually pretty easy, although there are some small difficulty spikes, the biggest one being 2 bosses at the same time, and with fighting being little stiff and delayed when you hit, it can get pretty messy. Bosses overall are nothing more than bum rush, just hit it until it dies with not much to it. Final boss is probably one of the easiest and most boring, mostly because it does the same things through multiple phases. It\\'s boring.\\n\\nGame is fine, but personally, I would recommend it if you can get it in the bundle or on sale. For full price, I would feel slightly ripped off by Metroidvania game being this short on content.\\nIf you want really, really good Metroidvania with amazing graphics and even better soundtrack and atmosphere, get Hollow Knight instead. A really good 2d platformer that is under rated great but censoring is **** Solid action/adventure platforming game with beautiful graphics. Frustration may occur agaisnt some bosses as they can one-shot you.  The visuals and tight controls kept me playing till the end. Beautiful art, fun gameplay, what more can you ask for? A great Metroidvania with some absolutely stunning pixel art. Tight controls, satisfying combat, and filled to the brim with secrets. It\\'s a little bit on the short side - taking around 3-5 hours to complete on Normal - but every minute is engaging, and you won\\'t want to put it down until you reach the end. Highly recommended. Pros:\\n-Cool story\\n-Great endings\\n-cute characters\\n-nice combat just like castlevania\\nCons:\\n-Short(3-5hours)\\n-low variety of enemies\\nOverall for 10$ (9/10) Only mediocre at best, and it really fails to deliver on its promise.\\n\\nEven on Hard (the only difficulty I\\'ve tried - if I\\'m right and the Insane difficulty means you always die in one hit then it\\'s no better, as it\\'s very easy to avoid getting hit by absolutely anything) it\\'s much too easy and much too short, and the relative inexperience of those behind the game is easy to see, with many mechanics only serving to pointlessly prolong the game in a way that doesn\\'t feel at all natural. The combo system is badly done - it features good animations but they greatly harm the fluidity of the character\\'s movement potential, and the cheap Dark Souls-style roll only harms that further given that, much like in DaS, it\\'s exceptionally overpowered. The world itself, if it can even be called a  world, is poor at best too: the area transitions are very badly done and give the feeling of a severely disjointed world, many places have cheap tricks that are easily figured out after just a single death but which cannot be seen coming on the first try no matter how cautious the player is, and there\\'s no real incentive to progress besides \"it\\'s a game, you must progress\".\\n\\nPlay Hollow Knight instead. It completely obsoletes this game. If you still really want to try this, wait for a sale. Short but very sweet metroidvania with utterly adorable pixel art.  Worth the asking price for any fan of the genre.  I\\'d be very interested in another bigger game of the same type by the same team. Bretty gud 10/10 Good game x3, beatiful grafics, very good OST and amaizing gameplay <3 THe artstyle, the music, the gameplay feel. THis game is so good as a souls/metroid type game. Not the longest thing in the world but it definetely felt amazing while playing it. A fun game with an interesting and atmospheric world to explore. It\\'s not very long and you can finish it in one sitting, but it\\'s a fun experience. The bosses are pretty challenging and get pretty nuts on the harder difficulties. There are plenty of secrets to find and the majority of them are simple enough to find without needing to follow a walkthrough.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Quick and rewarding combat\\n-Platforming isn\\'t unreasonable\\n-Great soundtrack\\n-Story is rather sad, but in an oddly good way that compliments the game\\'s atmosphere \\n-Can be a cat\\n\\nCons:\\n-Pretty short. Wouldn\\'t be so bad, but I really wanted more time and character interactions\\n-A few kinda cheap moments that get on your nerves (You can \"drown\" if you fall off a certain area, but in other water areas your character demonstrates that she can swim and breath under water)\\n-The majority of the game is set in a stoney city, which is unfortunate because they developers can clearly create very good looking worlds. Sticking to a city most of the time when the first few zones are set in a pretty impressive forest was a bit of a let down. Would have liked more diverse areas\\n\\nOverall, a great game at a really good price. Really solid game, interesting lore and characters, has a sense of mystery that kept me curious, but not completely lost. Gameplay was really fun, a bit frustrating at times, but it never turned me off enough to stop playing. 10/10 Really one of my favorite recent metroidvania titles. Amazing soundtrack, beautiful visuals, and well-tuned control mechanics. \\nMy only issue is the world and story telling aren\\'t as fleshed out as I like, however that leads you to connect a handful of dots and use your imagination.\\nGreat replay value, decent difficulty scaling and all around fun. good gaym Great soundtrack and a great game. It felt like playing a very good platforming game in the SNES. I loved it. I loved this game. The beautiful yet grim scenes, the boss fights, the characters, everything just showed the distress the world was in very well. The boss fights are tough first try, but their moves are easy to learn. Beautiful little game.\\n\\nP.S. I spent more time in this game than my info shows, just offline. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is one of the most amazing metroidvania game I have ever played, But now let’s start with the story.\\n\\nYou play as a priestess named Kaho from the village of Lun; she is on her way to the kingdom of Karst to seek/gain audience with the Queen of Karst, because of a curse/plague that is spreading though the land. But getting to Karst is easier said than done, and even if she does get there what new horrors will she have to face.\\n\\nNow there is so much to love about this game it’s hard to pick, from the beautifully animated graphics, to the Exciting action gameplay, the Intense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scale, and to the Mysterious lore and rich backstory woven into events, dialogue, and item descriptions.\\n\\nThere is just so much to love about this game, I mean you can see the developers really put there all in this game. You can see and feel not just the metroidvania, but all so dark souls and even a little bit of bloodborn too.\\n\\nNow for the things I wish this game had. Like more than one ending, and two a boss rush mode. \\n\\nBut other than that this game is all most perfect. Now with all that said I can’t recommend this game enough, this is one of the most fun, hard, and amazing metroidvania game again I have ever played. And again said I can’t recommend this game enough.\\n\\nSo if you want a metroidvania meets dark souls like game this is so for you. Pretty fun metroidvana and relatively short. Play on hard if you have any respect for yourself. Soundtrack is pretty good. good game Controls are sharp and clean, runs well on 99% of up to date computers. Fantastic pixel-style graphics and animation treatments. Only criticism for this game is that the movement options are limiting. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\\nFantastic bite size metroidvania/souls-like. Very cute and well made with beautiful artwork. Game is lovely. Well, This game is pretty good. I enjoyed walking throught the entire map, the battle systen is simple but that doesnt make it bad. the graphics are beatiful, dot. the only thing that I am complimentig of this game is the lack of backtracking that one has to do, but this is just something mine. I recommend this game to any lover of the genre The graphics are great. Plus the protagonist is as cute as a button. You have to be strong to turn even a leaf into a lethal weapon. Plus, the music, and atmosphere are all praiseworthy. Yes the game\\'s difficult, but, it\\'s worth the money in my book. Making its way onto my personal favorite games list is \"Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight\".\\n\\nIf you like metroidvania styled games, I reccomend you play this game, especcially with a controller. There is a lot of interesting content in this game, such as diverse bosses, enemies, items, locations, and characters. The game is not very long, but it\\'s a length that I find will have me playing it over and over and over again. The game is also not super easy, but the game is difficult enough to be challenging, not tedious or frustrating.\\n\\nMy only problems are that I can\\'t seem to change the bindings for controller buttons in the game and the story aspects are a little lacking, but the controller problems are not a big deal and the story feels like it\\'s in the game to give a theme throughout the entirety of the game.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard this is the fourth installment in a series, but I was able to pick up this game without needing to know anything about previous installments in the game.\\n\\nSo if you like metroidvania games that aren\\'t too short and are pretty fun to play, I highly reccomend this game! Good game, definitely part of the Steam Metroidvania canon. I got this as part of a Humble Monthly bundle and was pleasently surprised by it.  It was not a game I would normally get, but after looking at a few trailers, I figured I\\'d give it a try.  It has a good difficulty curve and decent platforming.  What is the key aspect of the game is the lore, which is fantastic, and the combat.  I can\\'t recommend this enough if you enjoy Metroidvania style games. This is one of those games that are hard as shit, but instead of makig you want to snap the controller over your knee, it makes you want to play more. One of the best 2D souls-likes I\\'ve ever played, with simple controls that don\\'t undermine the complex strategies requied to beat some areas. 11/10, beating the secret boss was more fulfilling than graduating college. I just finished the game for the first time, but there for sure will be a second, maybe third time, with looking for all the secrets. At the beginning I would just say that for me this is a 10/10 game.\\nThe gameplay is superb in nearly every aspect. Combat is enjoyable and pretty straightforward, but not ovelry simple. Fights are not hard, but the game punishes you if you are careless. Items are adding some variety, which prevents comabt from getting boring. Whole map is very neatly constructed, exploration gives lot of fun. For me the game also has artisitc value, locations design build fantastic atmosphere, togheter with great music. Narration is curt, but for me it was enough to make things a bit emotional sometimes. This is my first time with a Metroidvania, but I would say that it felt like 2D Dark Souls, which is a great compliment. For one playthrough, the game might seem short, about 4-5 hours, but I doubt you can find everything at the first try without looking in the Internet and even if you don\\'t plan on replaying, those will be 4 or 5 hours of consistent fun and, if you chose higher difficulty, also a bit of a challenge. With the current price (Christmas sale), it is absolutely worth it. Great game.\\nBeautiful music.\\nNot overly long but with good replay value.\\n\\nI\\'m not a platform\\'er gamer, but I\\'ve had this one on my wishlist for a while and it turned out to be a worthy purchase.\\nA good fun game to while away the hours.\\nThe graphics are retro 8 bit and they\\'re very well animated and give a great sense of feel and atmosphere. This is matched by the excellent soudtrack. The opening level sets the tone perfectly, and although some of the area\\'s theme music is more atmospherical then \\'music\\', it all works together very well to draw you into the experience.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a platformer then give this a go, the difficulty scales quite high and should be a worthy challange.\\nUnfortunately for players like me who only dabble in this type of game I do not see myself ever going to the harder difficulties. In that light I\\'d rather the game have a little more content rather then just increasing the punishment.\\nNote that this is critic from someone on the \\'casual gamer\\' side of the fence, but keep in mind that I had a great experience with the game and enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny that I could find (I got the true ending on the first run through so didn\\'t suffer the buyers regret that some people have mentioned in the forums).\\n\\nThis game is also a finished book, the Dev said that there\\'s no new content other then bug/crash fixes.\\nSo it is what it is.\\nThe asking price got me about 4 hours of gameplay on the first run through, but a bit of that was me just dying constantly because I was trying to use the keyboard : controller = much easier (as I said I\\'m not a platformer :)\\nI\\'m trying to run through additional times to try to get all the other bits and pieces, but keep that sort of finishing time in mind if you don\\'t have you\\'re heart set on grinding acheivements.\\n\\nMomodora RUtM is it\\'s own little cosmos.\\nThe characters are entertaining (there\\'s some neat fan art for it too), it\\'s well thought out, the story and action is enveloping, and overall it\\'s just fun.\\nBuy and enjoy. Fun game, started off pretty challenging but got easier as the game progressed.  Bosses where fun and fair took me several tries on average per boss.  \\nThe game looks and sounds beautiful.  My only gripe with it is that it gets a bit too easy for a normal playthrough and that it\\'s fair short.  \\nOn the bright side it has replay value if you wish to unlock the steam achivments which are very challenging.  \\n8.5/10 IMO.\\n\\nAlso a review mentions that there is no full screen which isn\\'t true. I\\'m really, really sick of this \"retro\" craze where games are obsessed with limited save points that are great distances apart. It isn\\'t tense to die after exploring a third of a level, it\\'s annoying.\\n\\nI hated it as a kid, I hate it now, I want this craze to die out again. I\\'m not asking for the autosave every ten second fad back, but when I\\'ve been looking for ten minutes for a damn save point you\\'ve gone too far in my book.\\n\\nThe combat is really, really, REALLY barebones. I have no clue how much this game might open up later (I\\'m already too annoyed at it to continue now) but the line \"Exciting action gameplay: pull off impressive combos, dodge attacks, and skewer enemies with arrows\" is laughable. There are three attacks and one is just a charged version of your ranged attack. Ranged does pitiful damage, which I assume is intentional to force you into using your melee but there are ZERO OPTIONS FOR MELEE. You have one frontal attack. That\\'s it. You can\\'t attack down, or up, you can attack directly in front of you. Every enemy does one (Sometimes TWO) attacks on a loop when you\\'re in range, or indefinitely if they\\'re a ranged enemy, and it\\'s honestly already boring after only ONE HOUR OF GAMEPLAY. It\\'s not even difficult, most enemies you can actually just stunluck forever with melee, the only reason I end up dying is because I get bored of playing cautiously and just hammer away at things so I can move on faster.\\n\\n\\nAnd to every idiot who thinks \"You can\\'t review a game until you\\'ve beaten it!\" I\\'m not paid to do this. I didn\\'t enjoy the game, and to your dismay that opinion is just as valid as yours.\\n\\nIf you LOVE indie retro sidescrollers I guess you\\'ll like this but every time I go back to play it I wander around 20 or so screens without seeing a save point, die from something before I find a save point and then just quit because I feel literally no compulsion to replay what I just played because of how completely barebones it is. I\\'m just happy my friend gave me a code instead of spending money on it. A very Dark-Soulsesque game in atmosphere and storytelling, if not difficulty. The player character is silent and your motivations for starting the journey are discovered by talking with more people throughout the world.\\n\\n\\n+Pros\\n\\n* Fantastic atmosphere\\n* Responsive controls\\n* Varied bosses and enemies\\n* Pretty graphics\\n* Very intuitive map layout and progression, without being linear.\\n* You get to be an adorable kitty\\n\\n-Cons\\n\\n*Short gameplay length (disregarding replays and achievement hunting)\\n\\nOne of my favourite games in my library, Momodora drew me in right away with its atmosphere and gameplay, and I finished it in one sitting. Its a game I still occasionally open just to wander around the world and see the beautiful pixel art, and each boss fight was incredibly memorable to me. . Really great music / visuals / controls. A game worth playing. Memorable soundtrack and gamedesign. Though short the game is very entertaining. Each boss has their very own unique mechanic that you have to play close attention to or you will spend countless times trying to defeat them. Each level has different type of enemies with different type of abilities with traps to keep players on their guard. Its not easy but its not too difficult either, anyone who has play a platform game should easily breeze through this. One thing I will note that though the story is pretty straight forward there isn\\'t much to build on top of it. And though they offer different enemies to fight I can\\'t help but feel you run into the same type of scenarios way to often I.E. very monotonous. However every time you do achieve beating a boss it does feel rewarding almost in the same sense you get from playing a challenging game. In short, the game is very simple to learn, great for short fun, and a challenge for those who aren\\'t use to games like this. Personally I give it 7/10. Good luck and have fun mates. Yesterday I was looking for a platformer game on steam, I searched for game that has low cost and looks fun and the video of this game got me stocked! a girl going in magical world with slow music playing in the background, boss fights and what seems to be a girl boss in the background. I am at age 29 years old but I LOVE this kind of sidescroller platformer games, so I bought it, just to be utterly - UTTERLY DISAPOINTED.\\n\\n- There were no hotkeys for spell casting like normal games do, from 1 to = for 12 spells, (1234567890-=) instead just one spell with cycle mechanic\\n- There was no way to play it on my full screen, nor did it have 1080p resolution\\n- The game on minimal difficulty is downright hard as hell, I choose EASY because I want to HAVE FUN, there is no tag \\'Diffuclt Game\\' like it should be, why don\\'t you put the tag?!\\n\\n- The enemies looks stupid : what seems to look like an underage girl without shirt that is jumping arround? a cat lady that giggles as if she read a joke, giggles  while she try to kill you? and another thing why is 99% of things in this game are females? where is all the mans? why there are no mans on this game? someone explaine to me why this game has nothing but females in it? did they all die from a magic that only kills mans but only let girls live? this needs an explanation or else this game is just prooving that the game try to get attention from guys who play it with poor game content\\n\\n- The boss of the girl I was hipped about? its a minigame where you have to punch her huge boobs one at a time till her tits fall off, HOW IS THAT APPROPIATE?! WHERE IS TAG FOR ADULTS?~!\\n\\nOk so after being utterly - UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED I was asking for a refund, I am an adult at 29 years old and I was in tears on my face from being BETRAYED like that. BETRAYED. BETREYAL. THAT IS WHAT THIS GAME IS. A BETREAYAL TO ALL PLATFORMERS JUMP FANS.\\n\\nDON\\'T BUY THIS GAME. THERE ARE BETTER GAMES THAN THIS . YOU DESERVE MORE. Go ahead and try Shantae half geeny hero or rayman. We deserve much better than this. This is for all the atheists out there who don\\'t believe in intelligent design. Excellent Castlevania-type game with fluid controls, gripping atmosphere, and some creative levels. A lot of people are likening it to Dark Souls, but outside of some moderate difficulty and a roll mechanic, I don\\'t see it. - Beautiful gameplay\\n- Amazing OST\\n- Really cool story overall Great metroidvania, definitely worth a buy. looks and feels great! the second or third boss of the game is an enormous busty giantess witch who you can only kill by constantly hitting her boobs until she fades out of existance\\nbretty good game You get to slap everything with a leaf. I didn\\'t play for long but long enough to know it wasn\\'t for me. Not exciting even for a platformer. More beautiful Metroid-vania goodness! Much more castlevania inspired than the previous game, and even better! Insanely good.\\n\\nHidden somewhere between Metroidvania and Souls-Like, Momodora: RUTM is a beautiful, fun, and rich experience, and may be the best Metroidvania game I\\'ve ever played. \\n\\nFor $10 it is an absolute steal. I really enjoyed this game. Great soundtrack and the mobs and bosses were interesting, and beautyful sprites. The story is quite hidden if you dont pay attention but I found it to be amazing. The music worked perfectly to set the mood It\\'s gud,\\n\\nCould do with some added things like terrain visuals on the map/area names on maps.\\nAlso it would be great if the warping would show you where you went. Instead of guessing names and hoping you get close.\\n The game is beatiful in all aspects: the pixel art sets the perfect mood with the music, animations fuent and satisfaing, the bosses unic, great game, spend the last 9h completing it on hard and lets go again on insane. 10/10 will be waiting for new \\ngame releases.\\n\\n\\n EXTREMELY GOOD< if you like metroidvania games you are going to eat this game alive tbh This might be the most charming game I\\'ve ever played! This game was quite a surprise for a multitude of reasons.\\nI generally am not too fond of metroidvania games due to how low my patience actually is however, this game really kept me going.\\nThe story is great and it\\'s dripping with atmosphere. Aestethically is also quite a pleasing game due to how well the pixel art is made (none of that fake nostalgia claims to justify bad pixeling).\\n\\nThis is not a long game but it\\'s a really good ride especially if you want to figure out all the secrets and pickups(which I still have to manage). Just get this game already it\\'s a great game. influence from SoTN, Cave Story and Dark Souls. fantastic spritework, visual design and atmosphere. excellent bosses and extremely satisfying upgrades. if you like video games, play this one. I love this game. I would never stop playing it if they had randomly generated maps. I found this to be a short and enjoyable Metroidvania game. The production value isn\\'t very high (nowhere near as good as Hollow Knight or Ori and the Blind Forest), and you only gain a few abilities before the game ends. Nonetheless, it\\'s worth a playthrough for those who enjoy a short challenge. Momodora was a great game and a fun quick playthough it was pretty fast though. Its very similar to hollowknight in my opinion, but it was far quicker than hollow knight  it seems though there is other endings though so thats cool. My main issue arrises from the main boss though, the main boss was a bit underwhelming in my opinion especially compared to some of the other bosses especially if you compare the music some of the other bosses just seemed more intense while the final boss was just sort of a let down, really giving you time to dodge and precursors attacks by a huge ammount.\\n\\nBut in conclusion I would suggest you buy Momodora its a fun play through, may be a bit difficult to get used to but its a fun fast playthrough.\\n\\nJust a side note I think it would be very interesting if they made a prequal where you play as the knight. It is a decent game.  I don\\'t regret playing it.  I do have some criticisms though.\\nFirst is the air dodge.  If you know where it is at, you can get it early in the game and it essentially trivializes a lot of the game.  The environment was clearly not created to take the existance of the air dodge into account with only a single jump (not including bug collection) requireing its use to cross.\\nSecond, I don\\'t like how there is enough dialog with some of the characters to feel like we should be emotionally invested in their existance, but not enough to actually be invested in their existance.  I suppose it is just supposed to be atmospheric I guess.\\nThird, the bow.  I don\\'t think the bow\\'s existance is properly justified in this game.  Sure, there are some switch hit sections, but the weapon is too nerfed to be useful.\\nWhile I concede I could play on harder modes, it is weird to me that you can essentially load your inventory with buffing and healing items, and then tank a lot of bosses.  I died more on the first boss than I did any other boss in the game. Incredibly well done Metroidvania, if you\\'re a fan of the \\'genre\\' you will enjoy this. Tight controls and beautiful visuals are the highlight here. Enemies could have been more varied and it was a tad short but those are minor complaints when everything else is just so damn good. Very fun actually. So is momodora 3. 2 is ok as well. But i\\'m gonna use this review as an excuse to tell you that momodora 1 is trash ass. but this game is great. One of the few games that was enticing enough for me to play twice. If atmosphere is one of the main reasons you play games then definitely give this one a shot! It was well worth it for me. Not bad, quite a charming little action platformer - good but not great. A little anaemic on the \"metroidvania\" elements, and quite short overall (games like Hollow Knight and Ori have raised the bar quite a bit in this regard though).\\n\\nAlso not difficult at all, easy even. Most bosses I beat in my first attempt and half of the powerups I never even bothered with.\\n\\nBut overall, good. Not great, but good. I have to say i came into this game with high hopes after hearing about someone playing this and they thouht it was good and so a few months later i gave it a try and to be honest i was not at all disapointed it was fun and difficult even on lower difficulties it was still a challange and i would say buy this game no matter who you are if you enjoy and tough game that you feel your skills get refined and you feel yourself get stronger then you will like this game by the end you will feel like you came a long way and the ending leaves you satisfied with a nice clear ending the final boss is a little easy but thats only after a few tries and for such a low price of 10 dollars you will not be sad where your money went i have put in 10 hours and started playing at the time of this review it is 9:37pm December 15 2017 and i started playing it 2 days before that day and i beat in with 10 hours on record and got most of the achivements done so do i recommend this game well for an indie game hell yes it is fun interesting clear and difficult you will get annoyed but you will love most of it i never came across any bugs either and the never lost my passion to progress so buy this game you will be happy! This is a lovely little game, super enjoyable, not too lengthy, but surprisingly deep.  There is a lot of content that goes beyond the main story line.  The soundtrack is incredible, and memorable! The animations are beautiful, the characters complex, and storyline well written.  I really love everything they did this cute, adorable game! \\n\\nYet, despite its cuteness, the mysterious atmosphere and gloomy, murky, almost disettling themes will leave you very intensely grasped within the game.  \\n\\nI really loved this game! Please try it out! I think the comparisons I\\'ve seen to Darksouls are unwarranted, but otherwise an excellent game for an indie action platformer with metroidvania aspects to it. Expect 6-8 hours of gameplay on your first run through, even with harder difficulties subsequent runs should take an hour or so since it doesn\\'t change too much between.\\n\\nIt is a short game, but the production values are high for something from a small team. If you see it on special I\\'d recommend picking it up even if it\\'s something to do for a weekend. This game is crispy.\\n\\nBreath of fresh air in terms of platformers. It has rather unique combat. I like it a lot. \\n\\nThe art is 10/10\\nAs is the character and boss design Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!\\n\\nThis is a metroidvania retro game.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Interface/Menu/Settings[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Video and volume options[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]There is a music volume slidebar available.\\n    [*]There is a sound volume slidebar available.\\n    [*]There is an 1x, 2x, 3x windowed screen and fullscreen available.\\n    [*]There is a Low, Medium and High Graphical quality available.\\n    [*]There is a screenshake toggle available.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Miscellaneous Information[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]You are able to play with an xbox controller.\\n    [*]You are able to toggle vibration on the controller.\\n    [*]You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller.\\n    [*]There are a couple of different languages available.\\n    [*]There are 5 Profile slots available.\\n    [*]There is a difficulty settings available.

Unless the game is really garbage and doesn\\'t deserve the 2H limit.[/quote]\\n\\n\\nI Give this game a 8/10 [b]tl;dr:[/b] Fun, beautiful, but short (and too easy). Recommended, but not highly so.\\n\\n[b]The good:[/b]\\nThis game is absolutely beautiful and oozes atmosphere like few others do. For this alone, I can recommend it and this outweighs the downsides.\\nDespite the game being low on dialogue (or any direct story telling), the atmosphere through what is given and through the art and level design itself is simply very well done.\\nThe story actually has a surprising ending (if you get the true ending, that is) and you do want to see how it ends.\\n\\nThe controls are fluid and easily learned. The game quite simply fun to play.\\n\\nThe music and sound effects are top notch as well.\\n\\nAnd finally, there are some quite interesting secrets to find, most of which will make you think \"Ok... what was that about?!\".\\n\\n[b]The bad:[/b]\\nThere aren\\'t too many downsides here, but those that are, are pretty glaring, making this only a barely recommended game despite all the good.\\n\\nIt is too easy. Really. When you play a game and beat the final boss on the first try without even using all your items, and it was the hardest boss, too, then you know you have played a pretty easy game.\\nAnd since I\\'m mostly a mouse+keyboard purist, I\\'m really not that well versed with controllers.\\nBosses in general are little more than HP sponges that require to dodge a few times.\\nThis is also probably the biggest letdown for people seeing all the Dark Souls comparisons and wanting to play the game for the challenge. There just isn\\'t much here.\\n\\nThe combat never evolves. Both your melee and ranged attack will always be the same, except for some minor damage upgrades (and one charge upgrade for the ranged).\\nAgain, seeing it compared to Dark Souls, Castlevania or Metroid - in all of those your weapons change [i]a lot[/i] - this is quite the letdown.\\n\\n[u]Both downsides are coupled tightly with this one:[/u]\\nIt is too short. My playtime after not 100% completion, but collecting all ivory bugs and all vitality items was barely five hours.\\nThe game is sold at 10€, but short playtime is always a downside.\\nIn such a short time, it is of course hard to implement a proper difficulty curve as well as more interesting upgrades.\\n\\nI really hope this game will get a sequel of sorts. One that is longer so it actually has some space for more weapon, enemy and boss variety as well as adding more challenge.\\n\\nPS: Yes, you do punch a witch to the boobs until she turns you into a cat. I love this game true ending(first try)  :\\') TL;DR A sprite based game that wants to be Dark Souls / Metroidvania but comes up short due to mechanical issues.\\nWhat it’s worth: $3-$5\\n\\nPros: \\nA. Beautiful animations\\nB. A unique main and side weapon combo (Strong, short range, 3-combo leaf and weak, long range, infinite ammo bow) \\nC. Smooth and polished, the game never felt choppy or internet flash game like.\\n\\nNeutrals: \\nA. Setting is pseudo creepy castle town with a few extra locales. (Not unique, but not bad)\\nB. Characters are interesting from a visual perspective, but pretty bland from a writing perspective.\\nC. Difficulty is considerable, but not unbeatable. Your character has VERY little health, save points are few and far between, and minions respawn as soon as you leave a room, but minions really aren’t that bad if you use the terrain to your advantage and careful use of healing items will get you from save to save without much trouble.\\n\\nCons: \\nA. Combat options are EXTREMELY limited as you get NO NEW WEAPONS (Imagine a Zelda game where you got a sword and slingshot and nothing else for the entire game).\\nB. The combat animations are very poor from a mechanical point of view. Again they LOOK beautiful, but you will often find yourself taking damage from an attack whose animation you’re cleared of or at a different time then when the enemy looks like it is attacking. In addition your ONLY defensive technique which is a roll gives no indication whatsoever of when you’re safe or when you’re not (compare to risk of rain where it says “INVINCIBLE” on your health bar when you are). \\nC. Boss fights are incredibly boring, which is my main bone to pick with this game. The bosses are just giant health sponges that you just roll to dodge, then pound with your one and only 3-hit, one button, combo (a game that has precisely one combo shouldn’t style itself with “Impressive combos”). That’s literally it. Hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, roll, hit. No finding an elemental weakness, no finding a chink in the armor, no using terrain, no selecting the right item, no blocking, countering, or even picking a different attack. You’re put in a tiny box and play a glorified Mario party minigame.\\n\\nConclusion: \\nMaybe I needed to crank up the difficulty to make the game feel more intense, but that doesn’t make a game better. A hard game does not equal a good game. A game must be enjoyable, which this game wasn’t.\\n It is the perfect mix between the gamplay of Castlevania and atmosphere of Bloodborne.\\nLove it.\\nNothing much to say. this game is cute. i get to be a cat and punch a witch in the boobs. Just like real life.\\n10/10 Nicely designed, compact metroidvania with some atmospheric art and music. It starts out pretty hard but it\\'s not punishing, and there are some fun secrets to find. [b]This review is incomplete and will be continually updated as I continue playing the game.[/b]\\n\\nSo far, I have to say this is a very beautifully-designed and composed video game. Gameplay is tight (though I\\'m still getting accustomed to the controls), artwork is stunning, and the music is stellar. I\\'m a real big fan of open world-type games that just drop you into the world with little instruction, leaving you to explore everything yourself at your own pace. The game is very reminescent of classic Metroidvania platformers, ESPECIALLY Cave Story which ranks among my all-time favorite video games.\\n\\nFor first time players, expect to die quite a few times. Whenever it happens though, it doesn\\'t feel like the game cheated me. It tells me that I need to change my approach which is a part of what makes this game so appealing.\\n\\nI might not be very far into the game (probably not even halfway) but I can already gladly give this game a hard recommend. This game is a beautiful jewel.\\nAnimation are beautiful, level design is smart, bosses are cool, ennemies too, everything is AWESOME.\\nIt is very polished, you can feel it has been craft with love.\\n\\nIt is not very long but has a great replayable value.\\nA must have game in my opinion ! Very good metroidvania styled game. Great artwork, sound and controls.\\nIs a bit on the short side (4-6 hours to beat) but a worthwhile gaming experience.\\nGreat exploration sense and character movement.\\nThe game is not hard, but don\\'t forget to save often. Felt good to play this game. It\\'s actually a nice metroidvania about a priestess, who arrived from a distand land to fight the evil. The general plot is nothing special, but there were some pleasant characters to meet, adding the depth to the overall thing. And well, nothing much is explained, leaving a space for any interpretation, just how we like it in Souls series.. Yeah, I may be not very original with this point, but this game reminds me a lot of Bloodborne and Dark Souls background stories. You can feel it in the atmosphere and overall impression. I\\'m almost sure these were some of the main inspiration sources for this game.\\nNot only that, there are also some mechanics borrowed directly from Souls series: bonfires, flasks, illusionary walls and I\\'ve even encountered a mimic once.\\n\\nThe hard difficulty was not really \"hard\", considering a high density of the save points and that there are not much attacks that one-shot our character. Some bosses died right away, some took few tries, nothing serious. There are multiple-times-harder things to play in the similar genre, like Wings of Vi with its absolutely insane precision controlling.\\n\\nThis game is also a bit too short probably. I may have missed some things and did\\'t actually do all that achievements content (like \"no-damage\" run), but discovered nearly all the reachable map and got the \"True Ending\". Took me 5 hours or something. There is a NG+, but I wonder if there is a lot to be different there. I think I\\'ll give it a try someday.\\n\\nStill a nice thing to play for an evening. Felt good in all the right places. It totally worth its money, don\\'t worry.\\nOh, and btw, you can become a cat there c: Great game with an absolutely amazing soundtrack.  Highly Recommended. Here\\'s the thing, if you\\'re really fiending for some sort of metriodvania styled game and you\\'ve already played Axiom Verge and Hollow Knight, then maybe its ok for you to drop some money on this game itch that scratch for a weekend.\\n\\nEven then, I find it a bit odd that this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. I found it to be incredibly average.\\n\\nWhat I think this game has going for it is that it does have some pretty impressive pixel artistry and some very good animation, and I don\\'t think the game is really all that \"bad\", its a complete game which is something I can\\'t say for a lot of games now days. Hell, I\\'m even fine that its a short game, it can take about 4 hours to beat. The problem is that it kind of lacks personality for a game that is supposed to be story driven, all I know about the game is that your trying to kill a queen because a curse spread to your land and thats litterately it. The combat was incredibly bland, all you have are arrow shots, a roll, and the same 3 hit combo to get you throughout the entire game. What makes it challenging is the artifical difficult of being hit about 3 times is enough to kill you and reset your progress.  Knowing where to travel next was a pain because, unlike other metriodvania\\'s, this game doesn\\'t really give you new power ups that warrant a reason for you to explore previous areas. You just get a key and have to try to remember which door you might have passed earlier that its supposed to fit to. The soundtrack of the game was ok, there was a song I liked in there somewhere but too much of it felt like generic japanese fantasy music.\\n\\nI think my biggest gripe is that you can tell this game wants to be Dark Souls but fails to come close capturing the essence of the series. When you use your bellflower its the exact same animation as crushing a soul gem. There\\'s a fight where the boss lights her sword with the exact same animation as using Charcoal Pine Resin in dark souls. The background of Karst Castle looked like I was back in Kanehurst from Bloodborne.Now, there\\'s not problem borrowing ideas from other games, it shows your influences and there\\'s a reason why so many games nowadays are borrowing mechanics and the overall vibe of the dark souls games. The problem is that I didn\\'t see anything in Momodora that made me feel like I was playing a game influenced by Dark Souls but rather a game trying to be Dark Souls with a chibi aesthetic. \\n\\nLook, the guy who made this game is a talented indivdual. I can\\'t make a video game, I\\'ve tried, I don\\'t have the patience and I\\'m not as good of an artist as he is. I want to see what else he puts out in the future, but here\\'s advice as to what can be improved upon.\\n\\nAs far as Metriodvanias are concerned, the games are usually about the journey of the hero and watching as they, and the player, grow more powerful throughout their journey. Provide some upgrades that improve the way the character moves throughout the world. Some of the basic stuff seen in other games is additional jumps, wall jumping, sprinting, climbing, etc. Also, use these upgrades as reasons to include environmental puzzles for the players to return to and solve. Use these upgrades are reasons for a player to be able to progress to a new area they otherwise wouldn\\'t have been able to access yet.\\n\\nAs for what makes Dark Souls special, its not just the combat, its the world. Leave a trail of breadcrumbs for the in areas that maybe have some sort of significance to the story. Tell a story to the player without using words. Especially with how great of an artist this guy is, I feel like that would be his strong suit here. \\n\\nSo yeah, overall, I played the game through to completion and I appreciate that it was a short game, but I think there\\'s a lot of progress that can be made on future games. The main reason why I\\'m marking this as a game I don\\'t recommend is because there\\'s already games out there that do the same thing but do it better, and while I\\'m the type of person to spend a ton of money on steam, if a friend has 10 bucks and asks me which game to buy between Hollow Knight and Momodora I\\'m going to say Hollow Knight. Great game. It\\'s fairly easy on the normal difficulty but can still be challenging at times. It is fairly short but It sets you up to play through it more than once with some changes added in. A short but challenging and fun game, recommand you get his during a sale nice A simple and nice game.\\n\\nWhat makes this game more enjoyable are the many open points in the plot and some intriguing secrets to discover.\\n\\n6.5/10 This is a legitimately badass game.\\n\\nIt has a bit of Souls, the Metroidvania style, skilled & challenging enemies.\\n\\nI\\'m hooked & so glad I got this game! What can I say that hasn\\'t been said before?\\nAn absolute delight through and through. There was never a moment when I felt discouraged or like the mechanics were fighting against me. Fighting and movement were fluid, and any time that I took damage or died, I knew that it was through fault of my own. Each and every area was unique and felt alive. It urged me to explore every nook and cranny for potential secrets like new items, powerups, collectibles, or areas. Music was fantastic every time with every song. Graphics fantastic and gorgeous. Music is absolutely stunning to hear. Gameplay is short but story is great. 5/5 definitely buy this. Very boring metroidvania. \\n\\nBosses are health sponges with instant kill attacks. Can you keep dodging while you try not to fall asleep mashing x? greate pixel art, world and gameplay\\nreplaying to kill all the bosses without getting hit is rewarding and fun\\nmore people should play this Simple the best sidescrolling I played in years. Lovely very fun fast combat, more depth than it first appears to have. Kinda like a metroidvania souls-lite i want to squish them so goddamn hard that her heart stops Great story, great gameplay. This game is really damn fun Not sure what I can say that everyone else hasn\\'t but I loved playing this game.\\n\\nExcellent sprite work, smooth animations, fun combat with interesting (and kinda brutal) boss attack patterns. It looks nice and feels nice to play. The dodge-roll is incorporated well and intuitive to use. The limited use healing items (Bellflowers) were a nice touch and along with the Shrine Bells as save points gave a Dark Souls vibe to exploration.\\n\\nThe story is limited but the few character interactions we get are interesting and help build the atmosphere. The only complaint I have is that I wish there was more of this game to play :) Absolutely fantastic game.\\nIf you\\'re a fan of Metroidvania games, this game is a must have.\\nCannot recommend enough. This is by far the one game I have on Steam with the least amount of lag. \\n\\nThe gameplay is pretty satisfying as well as the music. The combat is also good especially the arrows but some of the active offensive items kinda suck. The atmosphere of the game is very well done, some of the bosses are great, and the story is...kinda there. I have admit that even though I enjoyed this game, I would have enjoyed it more if I didn\\'t stumbled upon the completion guide. The moment I saw that I had to restart the game and follow that guide like the blind follower that I am.\\n\\nStill, this is pretty good game. I would definitely recommend it. A touch short, but if you don\\'t mind that its a top notch game. Its super cute and actually deserves the title of a \\'Metroidvania\\' Great game, my only complain would be that it is too short. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is an innovative, refreshing approach to Metroidvania/Platformer games. It\\'s gameplay is smooth and simple without getting stale thanks to several items, both active and passive, being spread throughout the game. It\\'s fun and interesting to try out different combinations of passive items together, and the active items are helpful especially at higher difficulties.\\nThe map is very large and open as in many Castlevania games. Exploring it is rewarded through several hidden items and Health upgrades. The map is divided in different areas with different enemies and visuals. The great strength of the game are it\\'s bossfights, they are challenging, fair and look amazing. They all play differently aswell.\\n\\nThe game\\'s a little short but it offers a lot of replayability thanks to different difficulties and a new game+ feature. The plot of the game is not explained in detail, which means that you\\'ll be left with a lot of unanswered questions. There are also some confusing decisions regarding level design. Sometimes you\\'ll find a room with seemingly no real use in gameplay whatsoever, the map shows very few details which means you\\'ll sometimes get lost, and there are several NPC\\'s that don\\'t really seem to have any use either. They\\'ll just say a single sentence and feel kind of useless otherwise, maybe they were intended to make the rooms feel less empty.\\n\\nHowever, all in all the game is great. Bossfights all feel unique and challenging, there is a wide range of difficulties, exploring the map and experimenting with different items is well rewarded, and the gameplay is heavily focused on timing and reflexes. The music is ambient and beautiful and fits the visuals very well. \\nAll in all it\\'s a great game. WHAT ARE YOU READING THE REVIEWS FOR?!?!??! \\n\\nEVERY SECOND YOU WASTE WITH THESE REVIEWS IS ANOTHER SECOND MISSED NOT PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!\\n\\nAND NO COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BEING 10 BUX!! YOU ALL HAVE MOTHERS WITH CREDIT CARDS!! A Dark Souls influenced Metroidvania.  Difficult, sometimes even somewhat unfair, but ultimately satisfying. The story  about a curse that plagues the Queen and the city of Karst,  is interesting if somewhat one-note. Boss Battles are mostly O.K. Pardoner Fennel is even a brilliant highlight. Not a flawless game by any means, but highly entertaining nonetheless. a cat farming items and power ups, in order to kill mother brain who wants to turn everyone in kawailand into zombies\\nalso, blue boobs What a good game 10/10 Well.... its good game Play it ! Adventure Game, Playing in Insane mod is fucking awesome, 1 hit u death. Very interesting LORE and very fun and hard BOSSES A solid Metroidvania with a great soundtrack and solid gameplay. Definitely worth the price of admission. Really challenging and gorgeous looking game. Love it.  Way better than expected with so few move sets. Great game, beautiful art. It\\'s been a while since I bought and played this game, but I had to leave a review to say it\\'s a wonderful game! I played cavestory a while back and loved how the game worked and wanted something similar to it and this game was the perfect game I was looking for. 10/10 mastapiece. It\\'s time to LEAF! Needs more rule34 This is a fantastic game with a cool and imaginitive story. The combat is fun, and exploration and progression all gives great feelings of satisfaction. The soundtrack is worth the extra few dollars and with multiple difficulties to choose from is open to many different levels of skill with 2D action games As far as games touting that retro 2D pixel aesthetic goes, this ranks among one of the best I\\'ve played.  The gameplay is incredibly well crafted, and has a difficulty curve that\\'s not too brutal, but not easy enough to make you quit right away.  The visuals are absolutely stunning, they remind me of Cave Story, but better in my opinion.  If we\\'re just going by visuals, this game is my absolute favorite pixel art game.\\n\\nAdditionally, the 2D platforming is solid, and feels a bit like Megaman Zero.  The extra difficulty levels can become incredibly challenging, especially at the highest level.  Even so, the game rewards you better for clearing bosses without taking damage (a hard feat), which helps keep the difficulty in check.  The true ending to the story isn\\'t particularly obvious to find, but definitely worth the trouble.  Metroidvania maps are back and in style, but don\\'t expect it to be easy to 100% those maps.\\n\\nMy only real complaint is the length of the game.  It feels like it ends right when your desire for more hits its peak.  When will we see a continuation of this series? A great gem that more people need to play. I randomly heard about this game in a non-gaming related video by complete chance, and fell in love with it\\'s art style on first sight.\\nWhen I finally tryed it for myself it turned out to be even better than I expected. The atmosphere was great, the npc\\'s characters are likable even though we don\\'t get to really know them that well, and the movement was fluid and satisfying. It was also really fun to try and beat this game in the hardest difficulty.\\nThe negative point about the game would be the main story which is weak to say the least, there\\'s barely any information on the protagonist, the final boss was completly disappointing and forgetable unlike the big majority of the other bosses, and the ending is a vague \"cut to text on a black screen\" type. \\n Solid gameplay, inspiring soundtrack, gorgeous visuals, good price, interesting story. This is so far one of my favourite indie game series. You can tell this game has a lot of heart and soul in it. Bought this game on a Black Friday Sale and boy did i make the right choice.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a game that doesn\\'t seem like much at first glance but once you dive in deeper you discover a beautiful game. I\\'ll slice my review into 5 parts. Story, Music, Characters, Artstyle and Gameplay.\\n\\nStory:\\nThe story of Momodora: RUTM is an unusual one. It\\'s about a priestess who\\'s land has been affected by a horrible curse and her mission to restore peace to her land. Never have i heard a story similiar to that and to me it\\'s very interesting. Soon we learn that the curse is caused by the queen of Karst but it is so because she has been cursed herself. On the way to the queen herself we learn more and more about the city of Karst and it\\'s surroundings. Some places are more affected by the curse than others but some people seem to not be bothered by it or even defending the queen herself. Blind faith? Fear? I have no idea but myself i haven\\'t fully understood what\\'s going on in this game and i don\\'t know if i ever will.\\n\\nMusic:\\nOne of the most important elements of any game, music, is done amazingly in Momodora. Themes of the songs beautifully match the scenery in which they are heard. Most of the time the music is serene, calm and relaxing. Only in moments of serious combat with the bosses do they take a different tone. Not a panic-y or pumped up one but more... serious and one that says \"Focus on the fight. You can\\'t lose. Your people are counting on you\" which in my opinion is made whole by the story itself. We\\'re not playing as a trigger happy gunman but a gentle, serious and modest priestess who\\'s not here to cause chaos and destruction but to bring peace. Music is very powerful in general and this game\\'s music is definitely something special\\n\\nCharacters:\\nAlthough there\\'s not too many of them the characters in Momodora are here to not serve you as a companion, guide or a fetch quest point but they\\'re there to set the tone. Throughout the adventure through Momodora i have felt something i have NEVER felt in a game. A sense of soltitude. I felt alone, walking through the Sacred Ordalia Grove, Karst City and Subterranean Grave and this made the game much more enjoyable. There is one character in the entire game you meet more than once. Later on that [SPOILER ALERT] character unfortunately dies from unknown reasons (most likely losing against either Dutchess Lupiar and Magnolia or even Karst Queen herself) and when i saw that i was sad, despite only encountering this character only twice or 3 times throughout the adventure. Way to make amazing characters that are missed when killed off.\\n\\nArtstyle:\\nEven though artstyle is a thing i mostly ignore in games in Momodora i did look a little closer and the scenery of areas is absolutely marvelous. I especially loved The Whiteleaf Memorial Park, but maybe that\\'s because i love gardens and i associate them with parks. I don\\'t have much to say about the artstyle of the game aside from saying that it is truly amazing and is a pleasure to the eye\\n\\nGameplay:\\nDefinitely the most important aspect of any game the gameplay is something that was clearly done with extreme care and precision. The gameplay style of Momodora to me resembles that of Dark Souls. Maybe because of possibly difficult bosses but it just has a Dark Souls feel to it for me. If you want to you can make the game way harder for yourself by only beating the bosses without taking a single point of damage. If you do that you receive special, powerful items that are definitely helpful and some of them even necessary if one decides to defeat ALL bosses without being hit. I did so on my first playthrough and most bosses weren\\'t too hard aside from Dutchess Lupiar and Magnolia. They were a nightmare to me because of Lupiar\\'s immunity to arrows and Magnolia\\'s ridiculous speed. Anyway, this game is suitable for gamers of any skill levels and in my opinion something like that is extremely hard to create. Good job, devs. You made an amazing game. Keep up the good work. I\\'d reccommend this game any day and i love it to bits It\\'s a flawed masterpiece like DS1. A criminally underrated hidden gem of a game. The cat sprite is beautifull. I just got into metroidvanias with Hollow Knight, I though that game made me pretty much biased, ruining similar games for me.\\n\\nThis is one of the games that has proven me wrong, fast and fluid, with gorgeous artstyle and a great OST.\\nA bit short, but definietly enjoyable all the way.\\n\\nHope there will be more! Its a great metroidvania game with smooth animation. What can I say but play it? It\\'s a beautiful game and a wonderful experience if you\\'re fond of metroidvanias.\\n\\nArt - Is wonderful, look at the screenshots. Cute pixel art and lovely backgrounds. Never gets tiring to look at.\\n\\nGameplay - Smooth and solid. Controls are tight and responsive and combat is slick and skill based.\\n\\nProgression - Simple but effective. You get a few equipables and skills throughout the game and have to choose what to use. It\\'s not a lot but gives a sense of reward when you buy or find them.\\n\\nMusic - Absolutely beautiful. The soundtrack is totally worth it in my opinion. I still vividly remember to fight with Fennel as the music opening the fight gave is such a wonderfully epic feel.\\n\\nOverall a cute and well built little metroidvania. Honestly my only complaint is that it\\'s short. Though that doesn\\'t make it worth any less in my opinion it just makes me want another one. To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. The lore is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of shrine maidens most of the mechanics will go over a typical viewer\\'s soul. There\\'s also Kaho\\'s Red Riding Hood outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation - her personal philosophy draws heavily from Japanese folklore, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the spiritual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these moves, to realize that they\\'re not just to seal monsters- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\\'t appreciate, for instance, the power in Kaho\\'s existencial catchphrase \"...,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to rdein\\'s Japan-inspired game Momodora 3. I\\'m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as rdein\\'s genius unfolds itself on their PC screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It\\'s for my waifu\\'s eyes only- And even she has to demonstrate that she\\'s within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.\\n\\n2018 edit: Attention ALL Momodora gamers! Kaho is in GREAT danger and she needs your help to defeat the evil Queen of Karst and fight back against the calamity! To do this, she\\'s gonna need a maple leaf and a couple of bellflowers. To help, she needs your credit card, the three digits on the back and the expiration month and year but you gotta be QUICK! Or Kath might not be the only one to suffer... Absolutely terrific experience will be given to the player. The world inside the game, its atmosphere can easily suck you in. Every death in the game will only fuel the fire inside the player to hone its skills and reach the final objective. Great Castlevania type game. With the exception of the bullshit instakill spikes, everything in this game is perfect. The combat is difficult but also fun to play, the story is subtle similarly to Dark Souls (item descriptions and some plot holes left for your imagination), the boss fights are mostly intense and satisfying, overall a really nice experience. Simply awesome ! The graphics are impresive for an pixel art game. You need to play this game. The art and controls just scream polish and platforming experience. Truly a labour of love, and I seriously enjoyed every minute playing it. Love getting back to old side-scrollers like Contra... but with the complexity of Castlevania... then make it all JRPG-ish with a dash of Bloodborne. Gameplay was great. It is reminiscent of many action-platformers, but also stands on its own merits. You start off with a basic set of moves. You expand these moves as the game progresses. Your abilities consist of: moves consist of a basic attack (that is also used as a combo), a single and double jump, a roll/dodge and a ranged bow attack. The bow may be charged to release a 3-arrow shot. Later, there are power ups that add to these abilities. I say add-to, because the original moves remain the same.\\n\\nThere are some items in the game - broken down into passive and active slots. The passive items grant a modifier to your character. These modifiers range from combat oriented to exploration oriented.\\n\\nCombat is your typical action-platformer style - enemies take a fixed number of hits. Your character has a health bar to track your character’s remaining health. Enemies will drop the game’s currency when defeated. There are no experience points gained in the game. Your character becomes stronger by collecting a fixed set of health power ups. Bosses drop something special if you manage to defeat them without taking a hit. Speaking of boss fights, they are all interesting and unique. My particular favorites are the battles where more than one character is involved on either side (yours or the enemies). As an aside, I only played this with a 360 controller and thought the experience was great. I can’t comment on other control styles. Sound and music were quite good as well. Some of the enemies help indicate their attack by sound. Each area has a soundtrack that contributes to its ambiance. One of my favorite tracks occurs in the monastery area. The OST is usually one of my favorite parts of a game - the developer did a great job at making this one.\\n\\nThe graphics are fantastic. This is an example of how a pixel-art game should look. The characters are well-animated. The environments employ a depth of layers and motion - as well as some nice “frilly” effects. For example, grass will wave as you pass by. There are also some interesting uses of water reflections. There is one room in particular, not too far after the first boss, where your character and the enemies are reflected in the water. It threw me off the first time I encountered it.\\n\\nStory-wise the game is also good. The story is revealed through tidbits from the NPCs throughout the game. There are a couple of sad threads. I am not sure if your choices of progress have an impact on how these threads turn out. There are at least two separate endings that I have discovered as well.\\n\\nOverall, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a great game that is worthy of play. I completed the game in about 5 hours of play. I can’t come up with much criticism, but a lot of praise for it. Amazing :) 意外的好玩\\n喜欢横板动作魂like游戏的玩家不要错过 Oh Momodora. I wish more people know about your whole series.

The combat is feels absolutely fantastic and the game has a good amount of difficulty to it. I recommend this to all especially when its on sale! Challanging, great soundtrack, nice graphics, really awesome game I bought this out of curiosity and was very pleasantly suprised. It\\'s worth every dollar you pay for it. If you like Metroidvania-style RPGs with a depressing atmosphere, just buy and play. You won\\'t be disappointed. It is a cute game with cute characters and a fun gameplay. This game is good. I\\'m honestly surprised that this game isn\\'t a massive hit. I\\'ve showed this game to many people, only for them to return with stuff on the lines of \"I don\\'t know what this is\", which really saddens me. I feel bad about these guys over at Bombservice, making such a lovely game which sadly doesn\\'t get the appreciation it truly deserves. So you, potential buyer of this product (I assume that\\'s why you\\'re reading this, correct?), let me give you the breakdown on this game.\\n\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n  [*]Gorgeous Graphics (the 16 bit lineless style really works in this game, forwarding the metroidvania vibe)\\n  [*]Great animation work (all animation work is smooth and gameplay wise, anticipation in animations help players with enemy and boss encounters)\\n  [*]Tight and simple controls (not too hard to get into, especially if you\\'re using a controller. Honestly this game is miles better with a controller so if you have one, utilise it)\\n  [*]Non-linear level design ((this is a minor spoiler about the world) [spoiler] The 5/6 main areas of the game can be accessed in any order and often loop into one another metroidvania style [/spoiler])\\n  [*]Has a good sense of progression and a nice difficulty curve, mostly (I\\'ll explain more in cons)\\n  [*]Has postgame content for players to go for more playthroughs (new difficulty modes)\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n\\n[list]\\n  [*]Quite short (First playthrough is about 5-7 Hours and subsequent playthoughs tend to be shorter)\\n  [*]A few weird difficulty spikes ((contains mild spoilers about difficulty, nothing that\\'d detract too badly) [spoiler] The difficutly spikes after leaving the tutorial area of the game which\\'ll take some by surprise. Also in my experience boss difficulty is also all over the place, though that seems to be a consequence of metroidvania [/spoiler]\\n[/list]\\n\\nOverall, if you enjoy non liner 2D platform beat em up stuff (a.k.a just metroidvania) then I honestly think this game will be right up your alley. The game rewards and encourages exploration while not feeling like a drag. And heck, with it being so cheap (especially when sales come on), I see no reason to not check it out. Lovely little metroidvania. It was fun. Freaking good game, I enjoyed every second of it. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a game to enjoy. A++ Would punch a witch in the boobs until she turns me into a cat again. I like it. Good story. Extremely fluid gameplay, Fantastic art. Well designed difficulty curve. I only have good things to say, but what really sold it for me as one of my favorite games was the boss item drop mechanic. It rewards players well for playing above and beyond, and does so without frustratingly arbitrary difficulty. 10/10, can not recommend enough. It\\'s great if you can GET PAST THESE NIGHTMARES. I bought this game on a hunch and i\\'m so happy that I did. It ended up being one of my favorite games of all time, i think anyone who gets the chance should give it a try. It has an amazing soundtrack and gameplay, props. You can play as a cat. 10/10 bLEssed by the b0ob g0ds. \\nVery hard. \\nPretty tough game. Simple but awe inspiring visuals, fluid gameplay and a great unobtrusive soundtrack.\\n\\nOne of my most beloved games. this game is like the STORY part of dark souls where every thing is bad and you have to save it A quality metroidvania styled game. I haven\\'t played any other game in the series, but I want to now, if all of them are this good. very good Challenging, yet fair combat with exceptionally good controls, a great atmosphere with pretty pixelart, a nice soundtrack and a simple, captivating story. And you don\\'t have to have played the other games to play Reverie under the Moonlight.\\nYou should give it a try. Hard the game pixle art and music is awesome :D [h1]Fun and challeging 2D platformer[/h1]\\n\\nSouls-like 2D hack and slash platformer. Short and fun, not so hard and more accessible\\n\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Cutesy pixel art\\n[*]Cool environments\\n[*]Feeling of reward by exploration\\n[*]Lots of challenges\\n[*]Creative bosses\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Respawning enemies\\n[*]Could have combos\\n[*]Few variety of enemies\\n[/list] The Bloodborne we didn\\'t get. gud game. \\n\\nIt has the difficulty of dark souls on with the right configurations. It has a decent amount of re-playability. It has really good music too. Apparently I\\'ve sunken 91 hours into this game according to steam. Who knew? \\nThe gameplay is simplistic and not in a bad way. It doesn\\'t ask much of your ability to press the right button. It\\'s simple. But the game punishes you hard if you mess up, despite how simple some things can appear to be. \\n\\nThe one complaint I may have about this game is that it can be a little trail and error. I find myself unfairly taking damage or dying to an enemy I had no idea was there. But that\\'s more or less the only issue I have with it. \\n\\nThe boss fights were fun, insane mode is fun, rolling around is fun. \\nThis game is just a ball of fun. I love this game All time favorite metroid-vania style game. Wish there were more of these. i liek it. Graphics and sound are both amazing, but the gameplay doesn\\'t hold up. There are lots of unfair enemy attacks and placements that are unpredictable without having played the level previously, so there is a lot of trial and error. I wouldn\\'t mind this usually, but the checkpoints are so few and far inbetween that half of the time you are just doing the same parts of the levels more than once.\\n\\nAs for the unfair enemy attacks and placements, this is what ultimately lead me to give this game a negative review. Certain rooms have enemies appear on top of you, leading to cheap deaths for those playing for the first time around. Another enemy can shoot at you through walls, and another throws a scythe that is sometimes literally impossible to dodge due to the size of it. If you die (and you will) you must return all the way back to the last checkpoint, losing any items you have obtained since then. It\\'s a frustrating game of trial and error, unfortunately. Imagine Metriodvania combined with Dark Souls style story-telling. That is this game and it\\'s great. Fantastic gameplay!  Great atmosphere and sound.  If you like Metroidvania types, this is a must-have.  It is pretty difficult, but enjoyably so.  Recommended. Really fun and super pretty game! Its a Great game\\n\\nthe animation and art is good to look at\\nthe story is decent\\nthe game is pretty tough in a dark souls style AKA you hit hard and enemies hit harder but isnt as tough\\n\\nbut the game is short lived as most of the inde games\\n\\nif you played any of the souls games and liked it give this one a try\\n\\n08/10 A simple but very enjoyable metroidvania, with cool pixel graphics, gameplay and combat. Sometimes it even reminds me of Dark Souls, not due to the game difficulty - although it\\'s not easy nor hard, but fair - but duo to its atmosphere with fountains like bonfires to save, warp and recharge your health and \\'estus flask\\'. Short version: imagine if the bloke who made Cave Story got hired to do a Metroidvania remake of Super Castlevania IV. Intriguing, yeah? That\\'s what you\\'re getting here.\\n\\nLong version: It\\'s a Metroidvania and, genre-wise, tied for second place with Rabi-Ribi under Symphony of the Night in pole position in my opinion. Whereas Rabi-Ribi simply exaggerated everything you love about Metroidvanias (MORE non-linear exploration, MORE hours upon hours upon hours of gameplay, MORE loads of items to find, MORE fantastic music), Momodora does the opposite to equally stunning results. Less is more.\\n\\nExpect to spend around five hours or so on this one, expect initially punishing platforming (top tip: your healing items get refilled when you save so don\\'t be tight-fisted about using them and don\\'t forget you\\'ve got a dodge button) but the atmosphere is unparalleled. Rabi-Ribi is weeaboo heaven/hell, Momodora is much more reserved in that it does a very good job of setting up and maintaining its dark Catholic vibe throughout the whole experience, without ever getting boring. Melancholy permeates every aspect, from the music (no occasionally obnoxious Castlevania bombast for bombast\\'s sake - there\\'s hardly any drums in the soundtrack at all which is simply remarkable in this day and age) to the enemy designs and the gorgeous backgrounds and animation.\\n\\nGoing back to the Rabi-Ribi comparison where that game was stellar in each individual department (design, music, exploration), Momodora seems like a much more cohesive experience, which is very difficult to pull off and for which the designers should be applauded.\\n\\nIn short well worth the tenner spent on this and am looking forward to my second playthrough and trying to beat the bosses without taking any damage for the secret items. Short and fun Metroidvania game. There isn\\'t a ton of variety in combat or movement, but the controls feel good and was very enjoyable. Not much of a story, but the art style and the animation is excellent. Awesome game!\\nBeautiful, great soundtrack, fun story and gameplay.\\nGive it a shot, seriously. Although not the joy to play Hollow Knight was, and perhaps too grimdark for some, this game is still a fun timewaster for a Metroidvania.  I don\\'t know if it has grabbed a hold of me hard enough to make me go back through on an insane run, but the 5 hours I spent with it were worth the cost of admission. I don\\'t have much to say here. Momodora: RUtM is submerged in a wonderfully melancholic atmosphere further enhanced by its piano heavy soundtrack, tragic characters, and depressing environments. The story has a minimalistic presentation with some dialogue and item descriptions to work things out.\\n\\nThe main stars of the show though are the gameplay and animations (well, the soundtrack too). You can expect tight movement, a simple moveset (which is fine for a 3-5 hour game depending on skill level), and tense boss fights. Plenty of attention was given to the animations. The melee attacks look powerful and can stun most enemies; her movements are accounted for with running, coming to a stop, dodging, idling, and so on; and the enemies were given the same amount of care for their own attacks such as Pardoner Fennel (amazing).\\n\\nI enjoyed this compact adventure that doesn\\'t waste any time. You\\'ll wring a couple days of high quality fun out of it. Game is fun, but it NEEDS a controller. You just can\\'t play with keyboard. I had to stop playing completely because I just couldn\\'t :) and that alone ruined the game for me.\\n\\nIf you have a controller or planning on getting one, buy this game, it is worth it. Othwewise don\\'t. This is a pretty solid platformer. I hesitate to use the term Metroidvania for this, there\\'s not really much in the way of gear-gating (there\\'s only one item you can get which allows you access to other parts of the map). It\\'s really much more like some of the original Castlevanias, aside from the open map.\\n\\nI found it to be a pretty easy game; there\\'s a lot to do but I didn\\'t find any of the common enemies to be particularly challenging, and the bosses usually only took a couple of tries, if that. The items you can get are fun but don\\'t make too much of a difference ultimately.\\n\\nI thought the art style looked really good (in most levels - some of the indoor ones get samey), and I liked the character designs as well. The story was alright - it doesn\\'t seem to require much knowledge of the previous games, which is a bonus. It\\'s not too complex but does give you a context for your actions, which is sometimes all it takes.\\n\\nTook me about 8 hours to get through but I went though and tried to get everything -  for 10 bucks I\\'d say this is worth it. Terrible for this series of reasons:\\n\\n1. Retro pixel graphics.   But they didn\\'t just leave it at lazy retro pixel graphics, they spent a lot of effort making retro pixel graphics.  This is like demolishing your own house and paying a lot of money for a wrecking crew to come in and demolish it thoroughly for you rather than just taking a sledge hammer to it.  The result, however, is the same... terrible, lazy, retro pixel graphics.\\n\\n2. Terrible controls.  The game controls are a lot like a terrible console port that never made it to console.  Don\\'t laugh, the controls really are that bad.\\n\\n3. Fixed resolution.  This is not surprising considering they opted to spend a lot of time, effort, and money on lazy retro pixel graphics that look bad because, well, they\\'re pixel graphics and it\\'s not 1992 anymore.  Regardless, other devs have at least made an effort to scale their terrible pixel graphics so they fit and work well on modern systems.  Not so here.\\n\\n4. 4:3 aspect ratio.  Developers who design games in 2017 at 4:3 aspect ratio don\\'t deserve access to computers.  Arguably, typewriters are too good for them.  We should question whether they deserve access to pencils.  I\\'m leaning towards \"no\". \\n\\nOverall a huge amount of effort has gone into making a terrible game with a direct and deliberate intention to include as many bad design elements as possible, and equal effort has gone into avoiding, at all costs, making the game look decent and play well on modern PCs. \\n\\nThey want $10 for this pixel nightmare that plays worse than Zelda from the 1990\\'s on a Nintendo emulator. Mediocre and extremely difficult in the wrong ways.\\nSpikes (which are everywhere) kill instantly regardless of health, and make you lose all progress since your last save. That\\'s the worst part about the game — you spend a lot of time trying to progress only to inadvertently touch some spikes and lose everything. Game over. Your only option is to load your last saved game and repeat everything you just did. It gets very old very quickly, and the gameplay isn\\'t interesting enough to play through multiple times because of spike deaths. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a criminally underrated game. I love it.\\n\\nYou play as Kaho, a priestess from the kingdom of Lun on a mission to eradicate a plague that has spread to her home.\\n\\nThis is a 2D pixel graphic metroidvania game akin to cavestory. Many people have drawn similarities to the dark souls series because of its use of refillable health items and spells after resting at a waypoint as well as its dark themes. However, I feel like this game is its own unique entity that deserves its own spot apart from any other games it may borrow elements from because of how well it implements them.\\n\\nThe game\\'s art style is superb. The game is worth the price in that regard alone. You can tell a lot of work was put into making the game an artistic beauty.  The animations are crisp and fluid. You really feel the weight of each attack which works well with the game\\'s great sound design. \\n\\nYour only weapons are a bow and a leaf. You feel so tiny in such a hostile world but you triumph through each battle. I highly recommend playing on hard in order to better get a sense of how the game is meant to be played. Over time you accumulate upgrades and items that make each battle easier. You become very strong by the end of the game. If you happen to play NG+, it is possible to beat every boss within seconds if you are skilled enough to pull it off. However, in your blind playthrough, you will die a lot - and you will learn the game more and more. \\n\\nThere are some points that the game falls short on. The story leaves much to be desired as not a whole lot is explained or discussed at all. Your interactions with friendly NPCs are rather limited in that you don\\'t really form a personal connection with them at all. They feel very static as characters. \\n\\nAnother thing is that the map isn\\'t so well designed. The map has a solid edge for a room that leads to a dead end, and a small dash for rooms that lead to more rooms - except those dashes blend in and are hard to see. It\\'s a real eye-strain to analyze the map so closely to see where you need to explore. You may become lost often. \\n\\nOther than those gripes, the game is very solid and the gameplay is a lot of fun. There are many collectibles and secrets to be found. Once you beat the game, there are a lot of items you still haven\\'t found. It leads to replayability in order to get those items and see what you can do differently.\\n\\n I highly recommend this game. I would give it an 8/10. Pretty good metroidvania. I\\'ll be honest, based on the ratings, I expected this to be a bit better than it was.  Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s a good game, but... it just didn\\'t feel as special as everyone else made it out to be.  It\\'s very short with fairly generic enemies and boss fights.  I will say the music was great though.  I\\'d say grab it if you get it on sale (which is what I did). Dem Pixels Tho.\\n7/10 THIS GAME IS CANCER. Excellent metroidvania styled game. The challenge is there, the bosses are fun, and the atmosphere is wonderful. Smooth and detailed animations. Fun combat system. Good story. Cool blend of Metroidvania and Souls-like influences.\\n\\nNot super long (maybe 4-5 hours depending), but excellent for its size. Pretty good action game. The trailers and gameplay display what kind of game it is, so I won\\'t bother reviewing that.\\n\\nCons: extremely short, 4 hours tops. Get it on a sale. This game combines the loneliness of the original Metroid, with the platforming controls of a good 2D castlevania game. It then adds a bit of dark souls to the difficulty and atmosphere, and the end result is absolutely stunning. Amazing game with no negative points that I can think of, which is honestly rare. My only gripe is that the game\\'s store page wasn\\'t able to reflect just how atmospheric the game truly is... Looking for Metoird on PC, this comes close. The story is well done and should be a \"Must have\" on the console lover\\'s list Fun and challenging.Pretty good Short but extremely good. I\\'m starting to play the prior 3 Momodora titles currently.\\n\\nMake more, I\\'ll buy them. This game is an inspiration to what games should be. Honestly, Momodora: RUTM is probably the worst in the entire Momodora series. While it boasts beautiful sprite work and decent music, it just doesn\\'t stand up to its predecessors gameplay wise. I felt like gameplay was slowed down worse than the first game, but they made up for it a bit more there with a selection of weapons.\\n\\nI don\\'t mind if the game is hard, as long as it\\'s fair to do so. Poorly telegraphed attacks/form changes leave you open more often than not during boss fights, leading to more than necessary deaths. Oh, and one shot mechanics. Because everyone loves those.\\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong, I love this series and have played through all the games plenty of times except this one. It\\'s monotonous and you would find a much better experience playing the other 3 games. Got this game to kill things with a leaf.\\nI stayed for the story. Simple but neat story line. I wish there was a spell tree to choose from however it would make the fights more interesting.\\n\\nRuns pretty smoothly.\\n\\n7/10 overall. Give it a try Momodora: RutM is a game I can gladly recommend. Compared to the last installment \"Momodora III\" a lot of improvements have been added which make the sequel look and feel far superior.\\n\\nBeforehand, my verdict for most categories are subjective of course except for [i]gameplay[/i] and [i]presentation[/i] where I try to be as objective as possible. If you don\\'t agree in the least, that\\'s too bad.\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nStory: 6/10\\n[i] The story follows a Priestess named Kaho, who travels to the eastern Kingdom of Karst to stop a curse that has been spreading across the land and affecting her village[/i] \\nFrom what I can tell the premise of the game sounds promising enough to deliver, although it doesn\\'t sound special in the least.\\n\\nSound: 6.5/10\\nMore times good than bad although somewhat boring to listen. The songs give you the feeling of a desperate situation and lonely protagonist which is a plus in combination with that story. I\\'d recommend the tracks [i]Alabaster, Assault, The Lovely Queen[/i] and my personal favorite [i]Fragmented Majesty[/i].\\n\\nGraphics: 7/10\\nIt certainly is no \"Owlboy\" and it doesn\\'t look as cool as a \"Hyper Light Drifter\" but it\\'s nonetheless some really fine pixel work. And definitely way more refined than the prequel Momodora III.\\n\\nPresentation: 5.5/10\\nThe presentation of \"Momodora: RutM\" felt rather unsatisfactory and might be the weakest point of the game. While the core story gave enough ammunition to shell out some fine world building, the complete work just can\\'t deliver. The characters felt too one dimensional to care for them and in the end the only one I can remember is the man who was looking for his (dead) wife. Same goes for the (true) ending which seemed...okayish. When you want to give some props in that category, then for the castle complex. Be it the sunken corridor, the torture chamber, etc...now THAT really fit the mood\\n\\nGameplay: 7.5/10\\nThe gameplay in comparison to Momodora III stayed more or less the same although you can\\'t spam the attack button anymore...which is good. At heart it\\'s a well refined action adventure game with a Metroid-like world you can explore. The combat controls feel tight, the difficulty is super fair and the passages are for the most part tricky when playing the game for the first time.\\nA let-down is the small weapon arsenal and the rather scarce secrets you can find ingame. But only presumed you compare it with other Metroidvanias. Otherwise it\\'s fine. \\n\\nReplayability: NORMAL\\nYou might not find everything on your first run.\\nYou need more than one playthrough to get all achievements.\\nOtherwise there\\'s not much going for the replayability.\\n---------------------------------\\n[b]Final rating: 67/100[/b]\\n\\nOne last tip for beginners and achievement hunters:\\nConsidering you start the journey on \"Normal mode\", prepare to die . And I mean a lot. Which does not necessarily mean the game is hard, the learning curve is actually really fast after you learn the enemies patterns. Same goes for boss fights which have always a save point right before the battle. Give it some time and you can breeze through the hardest difficulty. Just don\\'t start on easy mode, you can spam-kill all bosses with the amount of health you have and it simply destroys the whole experience.\\nAdditionally save yourself some time and start the game on hard mode if you\\'re in for achievements because you need a finished hard mode-run to unlock the hardest difficulty. Very good game. Metroidvania style at its best. Get a new item or key to progress on the map, and explore further. Difficulty setting is very nice. Graphics and animation are good, music is very good. Gameplay is top quality, just would like to see weapons other than the leaf and bow. Areas variety is cool, and they are beautiful. There is a kind of Dark Souls influence concerning story. Game tells you little, most npc characters are there to fulfill an utility role, or to set a light parallel story. Feels like a masterpiece. Cheers to brazillian makers of this game. Good job! There were many Metroidvania and even Souls-style games but only few succeeded in creating such a polished little Piece of Art as Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight did.\\nThe core mechanics are within the true nature of a Dark Souls game by focusing on exploration and healing managment instead of grinding and complex character progression.  \\nIt never stretches out any of its content. So if you do find a hidden upgrade or an useful item it contains more meaning and satisfaction as opposed to be flooded by a ton of new stuff or to face giant labyrinths in which you problably find yourself lost, sooner or later. \\nThis pacing is very refreshing and even if It\\'s short in comparison to similar games of its genre, every minute of it, is gold. Delightful reflection tricks on the first screen. Stunning parralax scrolling.\\n\\nCool exploratory platformer to boot. rlly good metroidvania\\n19/10\\ndeath noise -15/10 A light metroidvania with very charming graphics. Plenty of interesting bosses to kill, items to collect, and secrets to uncover. All of the different areas have their own art and music, and each are short enough that you don\\'t ever feel bogged down.\\n\\nThis is a great game, and you can finish it in less than 5 hours. Recommended for both fans of the genre and those who are new! Well worth your $10 Jiggling pixelated títs...\\n\\n\\nHELL YEAH This game is a Metroidvania-like action-platformer with beautifully and fluidly animated retro style graphics. Controls are precise and the gameplay is fun and challenging but very fair. I also really liked the background music which creates a fitting atmosphere.\\n\\nThe story is fairly simple but there are hints of depth in the item descriptions and NPC dialogue. I feel there are some Dark Souls / Demon\\'s Souls influnces here, in the way how the story and NPC characters are presented. \\n\\nI cannot find any real flaws in this game, if anything, the game is a little too short. I needed around 5 hours for the true ending. Kind of a shame, considering how good it is. I love the art style. The pixel art moves naturally and the colors go very well together! It\\'s visually pleasing. The game play is also pretty good. It games mechanincs aren\\'t so simple that it\\'s boring, but still simple enough that anyone could figure out nearly all of the mechanics quickly. This is now fairly high up on my game list! This game is beautiful. The art, music, everything works together perfectly. I love it. This game looks and plays very well. It\\'s metroidvania style keeps things fresh and flowing. Every area is beautifully illistrated in pixel graphics that easily pleases the eye. The combat is pretty standard, but still very much enjoyable.\\n\\nA critisism I would give is the under utilization of certain characters, as they\\'re only breifly shown or have little to no character development. They have almost no impact in the way the game plays and you can pretty much avoid all contact with any NPC on your first run and be just fine.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 8/10. Art is beautiful, gameplay is great. Short game, but worth every cent. Great game, although it is rather short. I came into it right after 100%ing Hollow Knight, and found the length to be a little dissapointing. The atmosphere is great, the art is great, the stylization is great. The only things that bothered me were the length, the bow (super op), and the secrets, which felt sorta screwy at times (invisible platform, which you have no way of telling is there). Otherwise, Great game. its a good as fuck game Even though this game is rated \"[b]Overwhelmingly Positive[/b]\" with over 3K reviews, it still feels a little underrated and flies under the radar for a lot of people.\\nIt reminds me a [b]lot[/b] of Castlevania and Dark Souls. There\\'s many mechanics coming straight from Dark Souls, even some of the player aura effects from abilities are identical and some items work the exact same way.\\nI have to mention it, because it felt so similar that my previous Dark Souls experience helped me adapt to the gameplay very quickly, since I could see what the devs were aiming for. I thought that was neat and didn\\'t take away from the game.\\n• The music is [i]fantastic[/i] from the title screen to the credits, I loved it.\\n• Gloomy atmosphere for the most part.\\n• Great pixel art.\\n• Smooth, responsive gameplay. (Capped to 60 FPS)\\n• Lovely save system. You just hit a bell that chimes and it immediately saves your game and restocks your items without any interruption. Multiple save slots from the main menu.\\n• Multiple different ways to engage enemies and take them out efficiently, you won\\'t go into every fight the exact same way.\\n• 4 Difficulty levels, with \\'Insane\\' being a fun and very fair challenge for experienced players.\\n• The only RNG is on some boss fight attack patterns and only a couple common enemy movements, but for the most part enemy spawns are static and they don\\'t attack unless you trigger them in a certain way, which is controllable and fair.\\n• Bosses drop useful items if you beat them without your health changing while a boss HP bar is on the screen[i](their way of tracking flawless fights, so healing nullifies \"flawless\" as well as taking damage)[/i]. I mention this, because a lot of people probably won\\'t notice this and it can be very helpful information.\\n• Hidden items to find, some are put to use for more secrets.\\n• Pacifist runs are not only possible[i](besides bosses)[/i], but there\\'s an achievement for completing one.\\n• A solid set of achievements that add a lot of replayability to the game and encourage you to explore the entire map.\\n• You are not required to complete objectives or gain abilities in a strict linear order. The way you play through the game can differ quite a bit from someone else.\\n• There\\'s not much story, but something is there.\\n• The game can prove quite challenging, but like Dark Souls, it\\'s very fair and becomes much easier when you learn how to play well.\\n• First playthrough lasts somewhere around 5-7 hours, speedruns take less than 40 minutes.\\n• I had already beat this game once before buying it on Steam, and it\\'s very rare for me to buy something I\\'ve already completed, so that should tell you what I think about the quality. Great sidescroller. Loved it! I love the fact that I can turn into a cat, I hate the fact that the fast travel kinda doesn\\'t work (Skyrim spoiled me). This metoidvania title is set in a fantasy world reminiscent of nursery rhymes... witches, curses, castles, knights and princesses.  Overall though, it feels a lot more like a studio ghibli anime (\"Kiki\\'s delivery service pops to mind\") was crossed with Castlevania, with a liberal and varied dose of sinister and oppressive (but family friendly) environments as well as peaceful ones.  You play a priestess of Lun, who is on a journey to prevent a curse from spreading throughout her home town.  Wielding an enchanted, indestructible leaf as a weapon, you encounter all sorts of monsters and people as time goes on, the latter of which will often guide you, sell you items and fill you in on the backstory of the situation.\\n\\nThe pixel art graphics are beautiful with the main character very well animated and the environments filled with details and lighting effects.  The environments themselves are also varied and unique with interesting takes on usual environments seen in games of the same genre.  For example, the graveyard area is more of a memorial park, with more plant monsters, statues and bugs rather than the usual skeletons or zombies seen in other games.  The music is rather light with a preference for ambient sound effects rather than music and, when it does play, tends to be enchanting or subtle piano scores.\\n\\nThe characters and enemies are also well animated and very interesting to encounter, often because the level design forces the player to pick correct moments to jump or strike.  The platforming is not particularly challenging (no pixel-perfect jumping required here), but enemy placement is often such that to ensure success, good timing and good decision making matter.  The Castlevania style item pick-ups are not used in this game; instead you have an inventory and can equip up to three active items, usually consumables, which are regenerated at save points, and two passive items.  The controls are solid and controller support is available, which I would say is preferable to keyboard and mouse.  Metroidvanias are famous for backtracking... exploration of old areas with new items reveals new paths and hidden rooms that were inaccessible earlier.  There is a measure of backtracking required in this game, but not nearly as much as typical metroidvanias, instead focussing mostly on the exploration of individual areas rather than requiring the player a scour all the previously explored areas following a new item pickup.  The few times where is was required, there were some really interesting situations/areas (I won\\'t spoil it for you...).  The bosses are tactical, fun and varied and save points are usually close by enough to make the trial and error process of learning how to fight a boss much less frustrating than it could be.  It is clear that the developer has put a lot of thought into how the game plays as well as how the game looks, sounds and feels.\\n\\nThe game itself is rather short compared to other titles of the same genre (e.g. axiom verge, super metroid), but it does have a new game + mode and harder difficulty levels.  Together with the different difficulties, I can recommend this game to anyone who loves indie action side-scrollers as well as metroidvania fans.  It\\'s absolutely charming, enchanting and fun to play. Small game with a simplicity that is both visually beautiful and mechanically sound by a small team that I hope to see more of in the future. In a nutshell, this is a short-medium length metroidvania game that should be enjoyable to anyone who\\'s a fan of the genre. Nothing particularly original about the combat, but it\\'s solid and the controls are well polished. Same goes for graphics and sound, nothing out of this world, but still very well done.\\n\\nHaving never played any of the other games in the series, I think my favourite aspect was the narrative/story: like Dark Souls, it\\'s light enough on exposition that there are lots of questions you want answered, but not so light that you have no idea what\\'s going on. Also similar is how the storytelling is pretty much all done through dialog (much of it ambiguous) with NPCs/bosses you find along the way, which helps keep you thinking and engaged.\\n\\nAll in all, I had great time with this game, and look forward to any sequels the devs might produce. If you\\'re in the market for a good old-fashioned metroidvania, you should definitely give this a shot. Bought it on a sale, was completely blown away by the high quality of assets and controls. Played through it in two huge sessions and got 100% on my first playthrough - which just shows how awesomely motivating this game is. \\n\\nMomodora is a Metroidvania in the best sense. It doesn\\'t confuse you with too many directions or items but keeps the flow of new powerups interesting enough that you keep going. There are both mystery and \"Dark Souls\" elements in the game to keep a weird mixture of eerie and cute going at the same time which I found very intriguing. \\n\\nIf you like games like Cave Story you should definitely give this one a go! Whipping boobs with maple leaf....quite an interesting play. [strike]Is this Bloodborne of side-scrolling?[/strike] Momodora - what can I say? I wanted a Dark Souls metroidvania, and it sort of counts...as long as I don\\'t care that the balance is much worse and the gameplay less dynamic.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Good platforming\\n- Heavy pattern memorization is challenging (though it goes too far in my opinion)\\n- Personally enjoyed visual style\\n\\nCons:\\n- Disappointing progression\\n- Bland characters/story\\n- One shot boss mechanics, feels cheap vs. Dark Souls rewarding combat\\n- iframes feel off and too much ranged spam\\n- Uninspired levels A amazing a good game  was not disapointed 10/10. This metroidvania might feel a bit short compared with other games of the genre, but that doesn\\'t make it feel devoid of well designed areas, charming artwork and music, challenging enemies and memorable bosses.\\n\\n[Spoiler] You can also transform into a cat 99/10 [/Spoiler] This game is straight up beautiful. I played it a year ago and seem to remember it being fairly difficult but not excrutiating. Please get. On the short side but super fun.  I finished it in about 5 hours with 100% of the map and about 85% of the collectibles.  Not a huge amount of story, but definitely worth talking to NPCs again.  They tend to move around and do their own thing.  It has difficulty modes and New Game+ for those who want to replay it.  I highly recommend it! Awesome graphics and sound, but the gameplay was even better than that! This game nailed the physics and the overall \"feel\" of the game. More 2D platformers need to take note of this. This game is not unfairly difficult, so I recommend it to anyone thinking about trying a side-scrolling pixel platformer.\\n\\nNot only would I recommend this game, I want to make sure people like me who may ignore games with the \"anime\" tag to give it a try! If you\\'re familiar with games like Castlevania for the NES, or Castlevania Symphony of the Night for PlayStation, you\\'re familiar with the \"Metroidvania\" genre. The \"Metroid\" in \"Metroidvania\" obviously comes from the game Metroid. \\n\\nThese games are categorized as such because they all share common traits. The player character is on a mission to do whatever. Over the course of his or her adventure he or she will find new items, skills, and secrets to unlock. Despite being side scrollers, often times Metroidvanias are not linear, so that means you may have a totally different gaming experience from a friend playing the same game. \\n\\nBut what about Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight? Besides the weird, nonsensical title, this game is the perfect embodiment of the genre. You play as a female protagonist, I do not recall if they said her name, dressed in a school girl uniform. Even though it\\'s pixel graphics, I always condone girls dressed as school girls. \\n\\nYou travel through different areas fighting various shadow monsters along the way. Not black shadows, more like pink shadows. It is very challenging, and you must reach a save point in order to save, so play wisely. \\n\\nHonestly, it\\'s hard to explain this genre, because if you already know it, explaining it doesn\\'t help,. and if you don\\'t know about it, all you have to do is Google Metroid or Castlevania to get an idea forit. \\n\\nSo I will leave you with this. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is one of the best Metroidvania games I have ever played in my life. I would put it in the same league as Hollow Knight, perhaps even better. And for the price, you\\'d have to be stupid not to get it if you like the genre. What is this fantastic little game I have stumbled upon. In love with the gameplay and of course the art style already, I wish there was more! i died on tutorial 10/10 holy crap what an amazing game i bought it looking for something to kill time and became an instant fan from the first screen, im already on my second play through beautiful game. Bad, unconfertable controls. This game looks great and plays great. I may start out a little hard sometimes but gets really manageable once you get the hang of the enemy attack patterns and get a few of the upgrades. \\n\\nIt has allot of charm. Its like Symphony of the night meets Bloodborn meets Cavestory. My only complaint is that the map could have been bigger but its by no means small. \\n\\nDon\\'t kill the spider. This is honestly one of my favorite games that I\\'ve played in the past year. I bought it for real cheap a few sales ago and didn\\'t play it until relatively recently, and I wish I had played it earlier. It\\'s a \"metroidvania,\" and it\\'s rightfully named so. If you do end up getting this game, I highly reccomend playing with a contoller because not only is there support for it, but it feels so much more fun to play. this is my favorite indie game it is good as hell. please play it and then tell the creators to make more Its castlevania, but i find it much harder (i have most likely lost my edge)...\\nAmazing soundtrack, and boobbosses. :>\\n\\nJabbaYo Approves A very decent game! The art is beautiful, music is charming and the combat is executed well.\\nBefore buying this game, I saw some negative reviews, which drove me away from purchasing this game few months ago. Now, when I\\'ve finished the game, I would like to laugh at some of the negative reviews, which said (more or less):\\n\\n1. \"It\\'s very confusing where to go next, the game doesn\\'t show you\". This game is in Metroidvania style, meaning that areas you can\\'t acces now, will be accessible later, when you defeat a boss, or get a certain item. The layout in this game is excellent, and you never need to run through the whole map in circles, wondering where you should go next.\\n\\n2. \"It\\'s like Dark Souls, only in 2D. The enemies are too hard\" 2 words: GIT GUD. But seriously though. Some enemies one shot you, and most of the bosses as well. But it\\'s not hard to see the patterns of the enemies. In my opinion, it doesn\\'t even get close to the Dark Souls.\\n\\nTo sum it up, I would reccomend this game to people who like paltformers and especially Metroidvanias. It\\'s a short game, but very well executed.\\n This game is good.\\nNice graphic, Nice game play.\\n\\nBut after 20 minutes of no save point and then got 1hit killed by enemy really make me want to quit playing this game.\\n Not even worth it on a 40% sale. Game extremely overhyped. This is a game with charming character design and an engaging, immersive world that you can watch slowly become a repetative chore to traverse as you desperately try to reach the next checkpoint before falling in yet another one of the numerous insta-kill pitfalls.\\n\\nLet enemy telegraphing become a thing of the past as you enjoy bosses that evolve to a second stage with almost no visual or auditory cue, before instantly teleporting behind you at random intervals with no warning while you gasp \"Nani?!\" and wonder where 2/3rds of your health bar went.\\n\\nYou\\'re better off just looking up fanart. I\\'ve only beaten the first boss so far and I\\'m loving this game. Combat was a bit difficult at first but after some practice it feels fluid, though find myself using charged arrows a lot. This feels like the kind of game I wished Starbound was mechanically, proper controller support aside. Great action-RPG highly reccomended. I generally don\\'t like metroidvania-style games, but I enjoyed this one a lot. Gameplay was fun and exciting, I never got stuck trying to figure out where to go next for more than a few minutes (as I often do in Metroidvanias), and the bosses were all intense.\\n\\nThe checkpoints sometimes felt a bit too far apart, and the instant-death spikes got annoying, but it\\'s fine when you learn to pace yourself. Also I had some issues getting the game window to display properly; my monitor is very small, and the game window was covered partly by my computer\\'s taskbar. It was a simple fix, though: I just had to move my taskbar to the left side of my monitor whenever I played.\\n\\nOverall it was a great game. A bit short, but definitely replayable. I loved the gameplay, art, and atmosphere of the world. The mechanics are a little simple, but very solid.\\n\\nDue to the simplicity of the movement/attacking/dodging mechanics the game is somewhat repetitive but is an overall attractive and rewarding exploration experience.\\n\\nThere\\'s some story between the lines throughout the course of the game which is really well placed and gives the world a vibrant depth.\\n\\nThe soundtrack and sound design are stellar and really bring all of the texture and muscle to the enemies, bosses, and to the game world itself.\\n\\nFrench Score 19/20\\nMeme Score 5/7 This isn\\'t the biggest metroidvania and it\\'s not filled with secret sections or optional  areas... and that\\'s actually ok. Took me about 6 hours to get a complete map, find all the health upgrades and beat the game. So Momodora IV moves at a very brisk pace and each area ends before it overstays its welcome. The first hour is pretty hard since you\\'re low on health and upgrades, but your options improve as you go along. Each area has a distinct feel, a fitting soundtrack and is topped off with great art.\\n\\nOverall I can\\'t find anything to dislike about RutM, it\\'s a perfectly paced adventure with just the right amount of challenge. The journey will be perilous. A lone voyage to a cursed kingdom will be quite the task for a priestess of Lun. Duty is duty, however; no matter the obstacle you must continue to fight, lest your homeland be lost to this plague too. It shall be no easy task, Karst’s cursed denizens know not themselves nor mercy now, but you are no dainty maiden. Weapons and their use are not lost on you, despite your profession. There’ll be no turning back once you\\'re off, so choice is vital; there must be SOME weapon that can do the job. A holy tool, fit for a divine warrior to dispense retribution upon the unholy and unyielding…\\n\\nSurely a sharpened maple leaf will do?\\n\\nREVIEW\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\\n\\nGENRE\\nMetroidvania/Soulslike\\n\\nTHE fourth game in the oft-unknown-yet-beloved Momodora franchise, Reverie Under the Moonlight is actually a prequel to the other three installments. In addition to being developer Bombservice’s second foray onto the Steam marketplace, RUtM is also the second of rdein’s quaint quadrilogy to have an asking price, so the question is: is this maiden-lead metroidvania worth its weight? Perhaps a little exploration of the metaphorical map of this game could lead to the answer — and maybe even that last friggin’ ivory bug!\\n\\nFirst and foremost, Momodora is a metroidvania. From the very beginning, one will be able to spot little nooks and crannies that lie out of the players’ reach, marking both their brain with a drive to return later and their map with an ambiguous, tantalizingly empty spot where untold reward may wait. Such secrets may hold useful items like powerful spells and passive charms, but most commonly come in the form of a vitality fragment — a miniscule-but-many upgrade to max HP — and ivory bugs — small [we’re talking literally 4 pixels in size here] collectable insects with a less obvious purpose. Some hidden items can significantly alter your playstyle, and it\\'s obvious that seeking out health upgrades is a must, so Momodora, as a proper metroidvania does, gives the player ample reason to fully explore the reasonably sized map available to them.\\n\\nIn addition to being a quite competent metroidvania, Momodora exhibits many qualities found in the burgeoning genre known as the soulslike. Influenced by the cult following the Dark Souls series gained for its cryptic storytelling and über-difficult gameplay, many developers have sought to capitalize on such characteristics to draw in much the same market. Though lower-calibur titles often go all in on difficulty, an overblown aspect of the series by and large, Momodora goes beyond and showcases exactly what a game of the genre should be. \\n\\nNot much is known of the cursed land of Karst, a plagued land where the undead and maliciously magical run rampant. Various NPCs play small roles and have their own short sub-arcs within the main story, though you’ll be hard pressed to feel even a modicum of joy for them when their curtains close. The world of RUtM is an uncaring, bleak, and cruel one — happy endings are hard to come by when the very fabric of reality is falling apart, so the best you can hope for is bittersweet. Save points are allocated to bell shrines which restore both your health and items, one of which is an ever-needed healing tool which can be upgraded throughout the course of the game. Additionally, certain save points can be warped to once the ability has been acquired late-game, allowing one to better backtrack and utilize new abilities gained along the journey. Combat’s simple but challenging, there’s a dodge-roll with invincibility frames, lore is discovered primarily through item descriptions — hopefully a pen and paper isn’t needed to draw any further parallels, yeah?\\n\\nWith combat in a metroidvania soulslike, of course, comes boss fights; Momodora delivers aptly, providing just enough to not feel overwhelming yet not too few to feel as though the game’s a cakewalk. Bosses mostly stick to strict patterns which, while easy to dodge for learned players, can prove challenging in the heat of the moment for someone going in blind. The challenge of fighting most of the bosses is often maneuvering around their various assaults and stage hazards rather than in the combat itself. If, through sheer luck or undeniable skill, you should beat a boss without taking any damage at all, the game is quick to reward you with an invaluable new item. In particular, there\\'s a witch with some rather large, er… ‘hitboxes’ that drops a ludicrously powerful spell if perfected. Momodora not only makes gameplay engaging and fun, but heavily rewards players for mastery of mechanics.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is goddamn gorgeous. From the intimidatingly striking design of bosses to the inviting, cutesy look of Kaho and the NPCs, one will never feel hard-pressed to remember a face. Additionally, the pervading gothic horror theme of the art style is visible in all of the areas within the game, save for two more verdant locales. The world of Momodora not only feels bleak, but looks the part too — bloodstained city streets and sweltering dungeons alike strike both fear and fascination upon stumbling into a new area. The game does a swell job of guiding you where you should be going without need of direct instruction, though it is of note that I broke sequence on my very first run of the game. While not game-ruining, doing that certain part early gave me access to a late-game ability which allowed me to skip certain grueling or annoying parts of the journey. Take it for what you will, but I tend to look at this as a boon; Momodora’s open-ended exploration rewards inquisitive players rather than punishing them for looking beyond the surface.\\n\\nAside from visuals, the sound design of the game is… good. It\\'s good. The music does its job, though I wouldn\\'t say there are many, if any, standout tracks in the OST. Hits feel weighty and, in turn, sound the part too, but even those hard of hearing may eventually be able to notice the monotonous repetition of certain sounds. Kaho’s got maybe two hit sounds if I\\'m remembering correctly, and due to the challenging nature of the game you\\'ll be hearing it quite a bit. Not a make-or-break factor in deciding whether or not to purchase the game, but it\\'s something to consider. Nothing\\'s perfect.\\n\\nOnto a more major gripe, sadly; however large the map of this curative quest may be, I found myself genuinely saddened by how short a time I spent in Karst. My first run of the game took a reasonable 3 and a half hours, but left me eagerly thirsting for more. With many of the aforementioned collectibles to covet and four scaling difficulties — one of which unlocks after completing hard mode — RUtM certainly makes an attempt to satiate that adventurous hunger. In my experience, however, I\\'m ever grateful that 3 more games exist, as I managed to beat the game 100% in a measly 13 hours. [Yes, the ENTIRE GAME. All. Available. Content.] This is both a blessing and a curse; the story and world building pulled me in like a black hole, but the content of the game left me feeling rather hole-ish myself. My proverbial fishing rod was bucking quite viciously in response to the game’s narrative, but by the time I was finished reeling in my catch it was naught but an oversized guppy.\\n\\nMomodora is that great dish you had at that new restaurant last weekend. Nothing about it was too complex, but the unique blend of familiar and new elements made you to savor every last bite of it. It wasn\\'t too pricey and it was exactly what you were looking for... but goddamnit if that portion size didn\\'t leave you wanting more. It was SO GOOD — all you wanted was for it to last just a little bit longer. But all good things must come to an end; that lovely dinner, this likely-unrelatable metaphor, and — yes, dear reader — even this review. I hope that, despite a few bumps in the road, you leave satisfied. No need to leave a tip, the experience alone was well worth it. Charming graphics and remarkable atmosphere. Beautiful game. I absolutely love it.  It not only looks great, but game play is wonderfully smooth and the controls are quite simple. It reminds me of gameboy advanced action playformers, in the best possible way. Ditching the lives system and using a health bar made the darksouls like gameplay not only more bearable, but probably the most enjoyable part of the game. I absolutely recommend this game\\n\\nPS. Wonderfully weeb pleasing character designs Amazing metrovania, good boss fights, good level design, good item progression. I feel proud that fellow brazilians did an indie game so good! Congratulations guys, i hope to see more of you in the future! Really good platforming game, and harder than you\\'d expect!\\nGood speedrunning material, will come back to this often. Smooth and tight little package with decent item progression, enough collectables for its size, spicy boss fights and a difficulty that rewards skill. It\\'s fun, has pretty art, a great soundtrack, and can be fairly difficult. I just wish the plot was a bit more fleshed out and the game had been longer. This is a great side scrolling adventure game. It has an easy to understand map, easy controls and simple mechanics. This thing is learning which enemies are going to be in different parts of the map so traversing becomes a good matter of saving your hide. \\n\\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure and a challenge. This game is especially fun played on a large display. The sprite work is really amazing, and the backgrounds have great atmosphere.\\n\\nAlso, thigh highs. I like thigh highs. I got this game as a gift from a friend and I am completely IN LOVE with it!\\n\\nFirst off, the artistry and care put into the animation is like something out of a dream. It\\'s as if every single pixel was polished and placed in every frame with utter love and care. The attention to detail in every little animation is astounding and inrcredibly beautiful. The story is interesting and the villians are especially memorable... though I won\\'t tell you why. You have to see for yourself. ;D\\n\\nNext, the gameplay itself is very fun: the platforming is simplistic but often challenging, the maps are incredibly exploratory, and the combat is basic but engaging. As many other reviews have said, it\\'s very reminiscent of classic platformers - especially Castlevania. If you enjoyed those games, I promise you too will fall in love with Momodora!\\n\\nIn summary, buy this game right now! It\\'s simply magical! what a good game, i got lost a fuckton, but this was a good game, i like this game. I\\'m going to play more of this game. you should play too. It\\'s really satisfying to move about the game.  Has just enough hidden to make exploring satisifying without overdoing backtracking.  Soundtrack is super, art is pretty.  Combat is simple but responsive and tuned. You know how code vein is like the anime version of Dark Souls. This is a 2d anime version of it but you get to attack boobs with a leaf. I\\'m used to something, but on \"medium\" this is pretty hard. Always sends you back to a checkpoint that might be pretty far away. Now I was just too annoyed and had to quit it.\\nThere has not been any interesting metroidvania element so far either, which is why i tried it.\\nSorry, but the first 30 minutes got me no joy at all. Literally broke my controller over this game. Fun, yet after you beat a boss or mini boss there is no save, you get careless after every mini boss/ boss defeat and it doesn\\'t auto save/ give you a save option. It\\'s annoying AF you can defeat a mini boss/boss perfectly (not get hit) then you die to shit that\\'s pointless afterward. Dumb imo, why would you feature that? so dumb.\\n Too many ways to die with one shots (red spikes) and set back to a save point with hitting all these close keys on a keyboard. Again another game that turns into reload - die - reload - die - reload - die - reload - not fun! What a great and lovely game! Cant recommend enough. Some of the finest 2D Animation I ve seen so far. This game is amazing, I saw someone running it at AGDQ 2016 and loved the look of it. Its a bit like a metroidvaina mixed with dark souls. Just buy this game, its so great. The first two games in this series are free (they\\'re a bit rought but hey they\\'re free) and the third one is super cheap and is fun for a few hours, so check \\'em out. Really hoping the guys that made this will keep this great series going. A nice little metroidvania. I was fun playing the about 5h long story. The combat had a good feeling, the music is atmospheric and the graphic reminds me of the good old time ;)\\nthe story is genre common and the boss battles might be a little to easy on a normal difficulty. \\nall in all money well spend. Never played Momodora before this game and picked it up as a random buy. Got around to playing it recently and couldn\\'t put it down.\\n\\nGood pacing, good gameplay, good visuals, good storytelling/world building and you get to play as a cat.\\n\\nEnding tripped me up first time and I had to look around for ages to find out the secret to the true end. This is the first game of the series that I played, but it was interesting enough for me to want to find out more.\\n\\nThe game is difficult, but easy at the same time. \\nThe boss fights are pretty fun\\nThe cat form is freaking ADORABLE\\nThe areas in the game are pretty and daunting at the same time.\\n\\nThe platforming isnt too difficult, so if you\\'re bad at them like me then you won\\'t have to worry about it too much.\\nThis game has a real classic feel to it, which is nice\\nThe soundtrack is good, and the animations are fluid.\\nIt\\'s short, but sweet.\\n\\nI definetly recommend this one. \\n Perfectly crafted Metroidvania; peaceful music, a just large enough map, and satisfying combat. Highly recommended! Gameplay : 4/5\\nSound and Music : 3/5\\nVisuals : 5/5\\nReplayability : 3/5\\nStory : 4/5\\n\\nOverall : 3.8\\n\\nIt’s a really fun game and only suffers from average music and some exploitable bits in the gameplay. The visuals look awesome in this one and it really shows how far they’ve come since the first game. The main story was just okay but there’s some extra parts that really stuck to me, for the sake of not spoiling anything I won’t talk about it. Replayability is fine, I mean it would be fun to play again but at this moment I don’t feel any need to, definitely want to see if I can change some outcomes in the story though. Everything in this game just works really well and I didn’t have a bad time at all playing it.\\n cons:\\n-too short for a metroidvania\\n\\npros:\\n-smooth controls and gameplay\\n-loved the sad ending\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni recommend playing it on hard 2D Dark Souls with cute art! Dark souls and Boobs = 10/10      Another great entry to cult classic series of games. This is Momodora at its very best. Its a solid metroidvania that take about 4-6 hours to complete on normal. As far as metroidvanias go, its unremarkable except for the fact that its gorgeous. Seriously, everysingle movement and attack looks amazing. This is without a doubt some of my favorite pixel art ever. \\n     Combat is challenging, fair, and satisfying just as it is in all Momodora games. You don\\'t have to play any of the previous games to enjoy this one, as none of them are directly connected. That being said, the first two games are freeware and I highly recomend playing the second one if you are at all interested. \\n     That being said, this game is Momodora at its best and I highly recomend it to anyone who\\'s interested in a shorter, tougher, prettier metrodidvania game. Jesus christ this game is a pure 10/10, go play it now! Momodora is clearly a game inspired by the Dark Souls series of games and at times it is just as fun, challenging and addictive. \\n\\nHowever, the game seems to take some of the worst aspects of the Souls series, specifically the first Dark Souls game: It has secrets hidden behind fake walls that give no clues of their existance, long walks between save points to the next boss, and warp feature that is unlocked mid-game, meaning more long walks for the player until unlocked.\\n\\nThe game also has many flaws that the Souls series didn\\'t have: With no auto-save feature, meaning you may lose a decent chunk of progress (including defeated bosses) if you accidentally headed to a boss room without finding a save point first and many bosses that are absolute sponges of damage, needing to be hit for minutes before they could be taken out, while each of their moves deal heavy damage to the player.\\n\\nEven if you have the boss\\'s pattern carved into your mind, managing to dodge the opponent\\'s moves while barely taking heavy damage from them (Some of said moves being too damaging for their fast speed, in my opinion) is a tedious feat that feels unfair and frustrating, much unlike the Souls games ever felt for me.\\n\\nOutside of gameplay, the game just feels unencoraging and sometimes outright hateful to the player. The NPCs often show their lack of belief in the player\\'s character, even after many achievments that the player managed to rip from the cruel game\\'s hands. Many of the bosses after the first boss die in an unsatisfactory way and without leaving a corpse. And the ending of the game is purposely short, unsatisfying and bad for the player character and the world UNLESS the player does a hidden, contrived and near impossible-to-guess action that, honetly, I didn\\'t bother doing by that point.\\n\\nCuriousity was about the only reason I carried on through the game to the end and that was solely due to how short it is. But there\\'s only so much bullsh*t I can take from a game until I break. Good thing I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle but I would not reccomend this game to anyone who find the above-mentioned flaws to be deal-breaking.\\n([strike]And no, there\\'s no fan-service to this game besides the giant lady. Don\\'t bother buying the game for that.[/strike]) Life sucks. That\\'s why ice cream buckets and Momodora game series exist, to make it better. [b]MARVELLOUS[/b]. Honestly, Loved it!\\n\\nOne of the best retro pixel games I have played!\\n\\n-Soundtrack was great\\n-Good Pixel art\\n-Solid game mechanics\\n-Overall a fun game to play\\n\\n\\nWas worth the $10 IMO.\\n Fantastic metroidvania game! Wanna hit some boobs with a leaf? +Story is there, could maybe be better or have more character progression\\n+Music is really great\\n+Most bosses are great and have awesome design\\n+Graphics are amazing, movements flow really well and look good\\n\\n-Some areas don\\'t even have music, which is sucks because when there was music is was really good\\n-You can pretty much cheese almost every enemy \\n-Little variation between enemies, enemies are reused\\n-There are some BS moments, like in Dark Souls\\n-Some bosses/minibosses are way too easy, especially the final boss fight\\n-Ending was underwhelming\\n-Wouldn\\'t recommend if you don\\'t have a controller to play it with\\n\\nOverall, I\\'d recommend it to anybody who enjoys metroidvania games or platformers Pretty decent Metroidvania style game. If you like that kind of game, it can be a fun way to spend a Sunday. \\n\\nThat said, a lot of the usual things you expect from a Metroidvania is average at best. \\n\\nExploration is more up to blindly checking every nook and cranny, as you would expect, but there are only very few of these, and the rewards are mostly just the games currency, which isn\\'t really useful. You also only get a very small amount of \"exploration\" powers, so the already small amount of areas you originally couldn\\'t explore, isn\\'t getting that much larger. \\n\\nThe monsters are fairly small in variety, and are either of the super easy variant, or the frustrating kind. The overall difficulty is pretty small, as soon as you get your bow a few upgrades, and you basically get the ability to one-shot practically everything in the game. \\n\\nThe bosses are great, however - There are some really good concepts, and most of them are fun and challenging, and well designed. You might feel slightly frustrated at a few certain bosses, but it is never due to broken mechanics or bugs. This is by far the strongest aspect of the game, and does this exceedingly well, even by Metroidvania standards.\\n\\nThe game lacks a proper story, and what it has, it mostly left vague and \"up to you\", except for the extremely anti-climatic ending, which not only happens extremely abrutly, but also with no real warning. It ends with a very arbitrary \"cutscene\" ending, with a small dialogue box with 3 lines that barely gives any real idea of what happened, or why. The ending was incredibly unsatisfying, and made the game feel incomplete. \\n\\nIf you care at all about a satisfying story and ending, this game is not for you. It\\'s a very nice looking, fun 2d side scroller what more can I say? i finished the game in under four hours. its an amazing game if you\\'re alright with a short great experience\\n\\n-amazing art, animation and design\\n(a very cute castlevania/bloodborne aesthetic)\\n\\n-simple but tight controls\\n\\n-bosses are nice and creative. all of the bosses had a unique spin to them\\n\\n-it lasted its stay long enough that theres never a dull moment. \\n\\n- other than its short length, a really good game. a great metrovania that takes inspiration from dark souls and castlevania. Beautiful pixel art and great controls. It\\'s a pretty short game though, which I found disappointing. \\n[h1] 3/5 [/h1] [h1] What is Momodora [/h1]\\n\\nThe fourth installment (yet my introduction to the series), Momodora is what is commonly referred to as a \"Metroidvania\". If you\\'re not familiar with the term, there are a few things the game should feature to be a metroidvania:\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*] A map, with lots of areas locked off at the start of the game. You should be peeling these barriers away as you gain strength.\\n   [*] Character upgrades that you discover through gameplay. Double jumping, wall jumping and so on. You do not start with these abilities. The start of the game is generally quite difficult.\\n   [*] A high skill focus. Combat is difficult, but you should feel like failure is due to a lack of knowledge or timing. With enough time observing foes, you should be able to combat them without difficulty. This means that performance is highly critical. If a game can\\'t provide a fluid experience, it fails on this point.\\n   [*] Not officially, but I\\'m a fan of high enemy variety in terms of visuals, especially in scale of your foes.\\n[/list]\\n\\nTechnically another requirement might be that it\\'s 2/2.5d, but there are lots of 3d games that fit the bill (Dark Souls, Metroid Prime) and I wouldn\\'t want developers to limit themselves so strictly to a formula.\\n\\nAnyway in these regards, Momodora certainly fits the bill and yet I have a feeling fans of the genre would be disappointed with that assessment. \\n\\n\\n[h1] Fans of Metroidvania games would be upset? Why? [/h1]\\n\\nMomodora is a great entry into the genre but it\\'s short. 5-6 hours and you\\'ll have beat the game. Also the attack variation from bosses and how long the \\'wind up\\' is on some of the more difficult foes means combat isn\\'t nearly as hard as in other games of the genre.\\n\\nBut that\\'s a great thing for new players. It\\'s not \"baby\\'s first action/adventure\" but it\\'s also great training if you wanted to approach some of the more famous games in the genre like Hollow Knight but found the high difficulty to be intimidating.\\n\\n\\n[h1] So how does the game play? [/h1]\\n\\nBeautiful. Animations are stylish and fluid, the various biome regions are detailed and enemies are interesting looking. Sound is great, although the music leaves something to be desired and the story is solid but barebones. The NPCs are memorable, which helps the thin story, but with only a few hours of gameplay there\\'s not that much time to fall in love with the world building. \\n\\nGraphics options for those who like playing with such things are limited. In this game I don\\'t feel it\\'s a drawback but if you\\'re the sort that MUST play in 4k @ 144hz, you\\'re probably out of luck.\\n\\n[h1] Bottom line: who should play this game and who shouldn\\'t? [/h1]\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in games like Hollow Knight, Castlevania or Metroid but you\\'re intimidated by the difficulty of those games you should play Momodora. If you\\'re looking for a short yet satisfying game, you should play Momodora.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for the \\'next\\' Metroidvania fix because you can only play Symphony of the Night so many times or if you\\'re looking for a cutting edge game that will make your hardware bleed, you probably can skip Momodora. This is my first \"Metroidvania\" game, it was super easy to start playing for the first time, everything is pretty simple to follow.\\nBut this game caught me with its tiny story, being just enough to provide context and depth to whats going on.\\nI would recommend this game to anyone interested in playing a \"Metroidvania\" game that has a good short story with it.\\nPersonally I had a ton of fun trying to beat this game. \\n[spoiler] I Mean True end, which was a little difficult to figure out blind running [/spoiler] One of the better metroidvania games i\\'ve played in while. Finished my first playthrough on Hard difficulty.\\n\\nWhat a great game. Best pixel art I\\'ve seen in a long time (if ever). The story is fantastic. The gameplay is great. I loved the music too. Apart from me wishing it was much longer I have zero issues with this game and I\\'m fairly critical of games. I will be looking forward to more games from this developer. Thanks for the great game! Dark Souls but not Dark Souls Great little metroidvania. Fantastic pixel art and smooth combat/movement.\\n\\nIt\\'s real good! Really hard,but looks nice for pixel graphics game :) Fantastic game, lots of exploration, fun combat and beautiful art style. Fine addition to your library and for this price it\\'s a must have. [b]Overall:[/b] \\nA simple story of a Priestess trying to free the land of a curse.  The various areas you enter into are beautiful, the enemies and their abilities are arranged in a way that are difficult without feeling unfair, and the abilities you unlock through-out the game add to your skill-set in a way that is enjoyable but doesn\\'t make future encounters trivially easy.  This was an 8 hour experience for my first playthrough, I loved every minute of it, and I have a feeling i\\'ll be hopping back in again soon just to experience it again.  \\n\\n[B]Minor Negative Gripes:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Boss difficulty varies in ways that are a bit strange.  The first boss you fight leads in strong with a simple but quick hard-hitting moves, making you learn to recognize his patterns in order to beat him.  On the other hand, certain later bosses have such huge wind-ups for moves that don\\'t seem to do nearly as much making them rather easy.  I definitely still enjoyed 80% of the boss fights (especially the Pardoner) but this had to be mentioned.\\n\\n[*]There are certain small ledges you need to double jump to get to in the early game that you can fail over and over again, but eventually get to, all by doing the same exact thing.  This doesn\\'t seem to be a problem in the later end of the game, but in the early game it was frustrating to do the same jump, over and over, and get different results.\\n\\n[*]One of the save points had enemies next to it making it so that everytime you revived they would start moving toward you.  This is a minor gripe, since they\\'re easy to deal with, but this is definitely a big pet peeve for me in video games.  \\n\\n[*]Rolling into enemies at the end of your roll causes you to get damaged.  This at times could be a bit frustrating since some of the bosses have moves that jump backward or directly into you; making it so you simply take damage for free.  It was something I really had to get used to and still found myself a bit displeased with at the end.\\n[/list]\\n\\nNote: A friend gifted this game to me and i\\'m absolutely glad he did.  I have no doubt, knowing how much I came to love it, that I would\\'ve bought this game and probably wouldn\\'t of even waited for a sale to do it. This game isn\\'t good.\\n\\nIt\\'s not bad either.\\n\\nIt\\'s mostly average, reasons below:\\n\\n\\n\\n-Very short. (4 hours or so)\\n\\n-The story doesn\\'t make any sense, very vague.\\n\\n-The true ending is unlocked by doing arbitrary room exploration that doesn\\'t have any connection to it.\\n\\n-It\\'s repetitive.\\n\\n-Feels unpolished, with things like some enemies leaving small black boxes into the walls after death.\\n\\n-Bosses are tanky beyond reason while not being complex, so the challenge is not getting bored while whittling down their hp \\n\\n-Characters have no, well, character, nor do they make any sense and are thrown aside just like that. For example, one of them dying later, but not like you care since you met them an hour ago barely, no connections ever made.\\n\\n-The bosses are as random as they could be with not much relation to anything, which isn\\'t maybe that bad, but a regular guy with wings doesn\\'t qualify to me as boss material for example.\\n\\nJust to name some off the top of my head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe game is not horrible, but these things killed the enjoyment for me rather fast and I just can\\'t understand why it\\'s rated so positively. There are far better [strike]platformers[/strike] METROIDVANIAS out there.\\n\\nI did want to like the game, but I just can\\'t. I received this in a Humble Bundle and it was actually the first game I launched from the bundle. \\n\\nI first played with keyboard and the controls don\\'t fit so well with keyboard so I switched to a controller and it was much more enjoyable. I worked my way through the game and found the game very enjoyable. The variety of items you can use to change up how you fight makes it interesting as you can customize your loadout based on the area or boss.\\n\\nI found some of the boss fights difficult at first but once you learn their attack patterns it\\'s just a matter of time until you land the finishing blow.\\n\\nIf you like pixelart and a relatively short action game this will be fun. Buy this game.\\n\\nThe artwork is amazing.\\n\\nThe sounds are perfect.\\n\\nThe gameplay ... has nothing that will ever frustrate you, which is good.\\n\\nBut it\\'s admittedly easy and lacking in depth in its level design.\\n\\nThe bosses are better, though some of them have the same feeling.\\n\\nIt\\'s a pretty much complete experience, and worth buying for some light fun.\\n\\nThere\\'s some miscellaneous stuff that would\\'ve been cool to see, but overall it\\'s a cute game.\\n\\n[spoiler]- Could\\'ve used some unique dialogue about how you\\'re a cat now, especially with the cat lady.\\n\\n- Would\\'ve been neat if I could recolor the thighhighs to black, or unlock a different outfit :>\\n\\n- I was expecting to eventually find an upgrade for an extra passive/active slot, but there were none. Would\\'ve been especially fun to be able to have the flame upgrade with both arrow upgrades.\\n\\n- I was also expecting to find a second upgrade for the bow\\'s charge speed, and something to make the air-dash regenerate faster.\\n\\n- Eventually you realize that you can just dash through all the obstacles, except for the bosses, which then trivializes the game to a degree.\\n\\n- The map\\'s design is a little weird, as it has a lot of indentation shapes that I thought would lead to places. For the most part, it does a good job of showing you that something continues in this direction or not, but there are some spots where the walls on the map don\\'t match up with the fact that there\\'s something in that direction. It wasn\\'t really a problem though, as it\\'s easy enough to traverse everything, and that problem is also solved by simply dipping into each room you pass by, so an uncompleted path opens in that direction.\\n\\n- For NPCs whose dialogue can change, they could\\'ve had something like a [ ! ] symbol above them to indicate the unique dialogue.\\n\\n- Momodora could\\'ve also used more miniquests with sub-stories. Would help make the game world more tangible and fleshed out.\\n\\n- I was confused about what the green thing was that popped up at the windmill leading to the Fresh Spring Leaf. It\\'s the only thing I looked up a guide for, because it\\'s something you can come across many times before you\\'re even close to actually unlocking it. Could\\'ve been explained better, with something like an NPC that explains its history and how wind magic is needed to make it work. Perhaps a spirit who appears when the nearby enemies are defeated.\\n\\n- After a while you realize that you can easily stun every enemy with first attack. This is somewhat rectified by the bosses, but I suppose having more endgame enemies that shield or even counter immediately after shielding would\\'ve been neat.[/spoiler] its a pretty good game the controls are really fluent and most of the time deaths were because of mistakes, its really challenging playing on the higher dificultys and the soundtrack goes good with the graphical design it feels really linier but its actually not its got plenty of side \"quest\" to do before actually finishing pick it up if you like these kinds of game Quite charming metroidvania style game. Perfect choice if you want to play a good game you can enjoy in 2-3 night sittings. A Sidescroller Delight\\n\\nThis game pulls you in.\\n\\nVery enjoyable to play.\\n\\nBuy this game A great metroidvania type game with a decent challenge and adorable characters. The setting has a very Dark Souls/Bloodborne type feel to it that I love. This game just really hit the right spot for me. I have had a lot of fun with this game. I have not quite been playing the entrie 22 hours, I kinda have a habit of letting games run, however I have put quite a few hours in and I am at least 75% of the way though the game. I am having a lot of fun finding the secrets even with a special item that tells me there is a secret in the room, it is not always obvious where that secret is located. It reminds me a lot of Castlevania and the game play is similar. While it did not have a leveling up feture, as you go through the game you get items that feel like you leveled up. 100% would recomend! For 10 bucks, this is pretty dang good. \\n\\nCombat feels meaty and heavy in a very satisfying way. Exploration is rewarding. Boss encounters are a blast to learn. The game sprinkles out just enough info to get me intrigued in the world and what it is I\\'m supposed to be doing in the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s one flaw with me is a pretty big one though. It doesn\\'t really have a lot of replay value. As far as I can tell, there isn\\'t much incentive to play again since there is only one melee weapon type in the game and one ranged weapon.\\n\\nStill, you get to explore a variety of locations with a lot of verrying enemies to face. Like I said, for 10 bucks, this is all pretty dang good. I don\\'t understand everyone\\'s obsession with arbitrarily difficult side-scrollers. Gaming evolved past this for a reason. Beaten - About 5 hours\\n\\nAn excellent gated platformer/\"metroid-vania\" style game with JUST the right balance of difficulty and fun.  Really well done.  Would easily recommend. Super tough\\nSuper fun\\njust entertaining Indie metroidvania game from Japanese indie developper rdein and team.\\n\\nThis game is short (not so much compared to its inspirations) but packed with content: 8 different areas each with its tileset, hazards, monsters and music. Thanks to this each area has its distinct \"mood\" and feel, which is a must for a metroidvania kind of game.\\nThe combat is good \\'though I feel it could have even more depth. Your only two weapons remain nearly the same throughout the whole game. All the same, the dodging mechanics and the platforming work well enough but lack a little bit of renewal - which is compensated by the many boss fights.\\nSome design decisions (mainly spikes that instantly kill you) imho have a negative impact on the difficulty curve and are borderline questionnable. Hopefully, the game provides just enough checkpoints that it should rarely feel unfair, if at all.\\n\\nWhat I think really sets this game apart the most is the extreme care to detail, especially in graphics and sound department. The pixel art backgrounds, characters and animations are gorgeous, lighting and particle effects are used sporadically and well-integrated.\\nThe sound effects are mostly minimalistic (8bit-like). The music and background music is CD quality, the production standards being surprisingly good for \"small\" scale indie title.\\n\\nThere is a story to the game, but only a few talking characters and they don\\'t have very much to tell you - which is not a bad thing ! In a sense, the places the main character visits and the boss she fights are more telling, \\'though some is left to interpretation. Although there exist solid steel weapons and Kaho can use a bow, magic is everywhere in the game. Kaho fights using a maple leaf, saves progress at prayer spots. Most ennemies use magic or *are* made of magic. If you like Japanese stories about mythology or folklore (think Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away) even a little bit, the background should appeal to you - but that shouldn\\'t be a must to enjoy the game.\\n\\nA must have for metroidvania fans and even others -like myself-.\\n\\nPS. this is but a detail, but the update history shows the game has had good support over the months, with devs careful to fix bugs or balance gameplay when needed. \\'Though not everyone will agree about the difficulty curve, it is a pretty polished game Ahhhh man, this game is so hard, yet so fun at the same time!!! The game is really punishing when you make mistakes even on \"normal\" difficulty, but the satisfaction when you overcome the challenges feels so good. Enemy placements on the map are like puzzles and you solve them by hitting at the right timewindow and right position. You can really tell that the dev put much effort into designing these \"puzzles\". This game is just so fun to play. It reminds me of the Metroid games on GBA. And the aesthetic and music is really enjoyable, too. It give me the feeling of cuteness and sadness at the same time. Weird. Conclusion: Challenging gameplay, good art and music, this is a must-play gem if you like the old Metroid series on GBA. The artwork is amazing, the music made me feel a range of emotions, and the controls weren\\'t overly complicated. I\\'d say this game is a 10/10 for me! This game is really beautiful. The soundtrack is well done, too.\\nIt feels like a sidescroll version of Darksouls.\\nOne suggestion: the non-boss enemies are a bit easy to defeat, or at least their attack patterns are really limited. There are also not very much different kinds, a bit more creativity in this sector would really be nice.\\nOn the other hand the terrine is nice built and fun to explore. A 2D Dark Souls / Metroidvania that is short, sweet, and perfectly executed. There is no more concise description. This is absolutely great + it\\'s hard! The last game from the Momodora Series. Bosses make you rage quit! Dark Souls style that deserves appreciation! One of the best....BEST...Metroidvania games ever made.  It really brings a tear to my eye to see a game produced under such a great pair of IPs(Metroid and Castlevania) and introduce new ideas and feels to the genre.  If you like amazing games and don\\'t already own this game, please do yourself a favor and buy this game! good game thats similar to dark souls \\n This game is a great addition to any metroidvania fan\\'s library. here are my thoughts on the game:\\n+ nonlinear map with a lot of secrets.\\n+ simple but interesting combat.\\n+ great bosses.\\n+ interesting and varied map with great atmosphere (reminds me of freeware rpgmaker horror games - but in a good way)\\n+ great music\\n~ short (about 5 hours)\\n- enemies are not as varied as I would have hoped. So this is a good, competent game. But I bought it for the Metroidvania tag, and this is not in any meaningful sense a Metroidvania. \\n\\nA Metroidvania is built around exploration and rewarding the player with exciting new means of exploration. The world opens up in organic, interesting, unintuitive ways when a boss drops a Samus ball or a double jump macguffen or a cloak that lets you walk through walls. Even if you\\'re not breaking sequence, it *feels* like you\\'re getting away with something. \\n\\nThis game only pays lip-service to that core mechanic. The player unlocks 1 1/2 ways to move around the world, but they don\\'t go anywhere interesting or off the beaten path. The level design actively penalizes exploration with permadeath traps and hidden enemies, so that too often any sense of freedom or wonder is ripped away as you die to a hazard you couldn\\'t have foreseen and run through the same set of rooms again, except this time you know where the spikes are. \\n\\nWhich is fine! \\n\\nFor the kind of game it is, this is fine. The controls are tight enough to be fair. Save points are frequent enough not to be too frustrating, Enemies all have satisfying counters. The cramped, tense feel of the levels works for this game. \\n\\nBut it\\'s not Axiom Verge or Hollow Knight or, I dunno, Unepic. So go in with your eyes open, is all I\\'m saying. Charming pixel graphic style; great ost and general sound effects, very fun gameplay with interesting lore and story. After long season of Hollow Knight, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight feels too short but gameplay is fun so you can always try on hard mode and hunt some achievement!\\n\\nSummary is: Short but extremely fun game if you are into metroidvania kind of games! Fun game so far, but it would be nice if you could edit the controls and buttons to your comfort. Unless I haven\\'t looked too much into the settings... I slapped witch tittes with a maple leaf 10/10\\n Noice This is a beautifully crafted indie title with incredible pixel art that is as detailed as it needs to be to suit the chosen art style. \\n\\nThis is something I would have normally looked over, but what repeatedly kept drawing me back to this game to look at was that I interested by the main art piece on the store page that just looked great. Liked the art style. Not the same art style in game, but it still kept drawing me back. Which is what cover/key art is supposed to do really.\\n\\nAnyway. I could go in to deep details but I\\'ll try to keep this short and sweet. Based on three point factors, Pros (+), Nuetral (+/-) and Cons (-). (IMPORTANT NOTE: Neutral means it can be taken as a pro or a con, depending on your opinion)\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n(+) Controls are fluid, and tight.\\n(+) I doubt there will be any optimization issues for anyone.\\n(+) Combat is fun and challenging, even on easy it\\'s possible to make a mistake.\\n(+) Great amount of Explorability. Plus hidden Collectibles which give objective benefits if collected to justify extra rooms.\\n(+) Great active and passive item system to combat the different varieties of enemies and bosses.\\n(+) Appropriately priced. With 6 hours on my first playthrough and the game costing 6.99. If I hadn\\'t of been given a key for this by a friend, I would have been happy to pay for this full price. \\n\\nNuetral:\\n\\n(+/-) Game only runs in a 4:3 aspect ratio (Personally this fine for me)\\n(+/-) I couldn\\'t get Shadowplay or Rivatuner to work with this game so I couldn\\'t tell you if there\\'s an FPS limit of any kind, but I assume it\\'ll be 60FPS locked, based on the type of game.\\n\\nCons: \\n\\n(-) I did have some crashes, especially when I accidentally pulled out my controller cable, which crashes the game completely and causes extremely long system hangs every time it happens (By that I mean it\\'s difficult to get the game to close once it\\'s crashed)\\n\\nOther than the odd crash. No other issues.\\n\\nFor those wondering, I played with a PS4 controller using DS4Windows (Available online here: http://ds4windows.com/) I did not try playing with keyboard, so I cannot comment on that :p\\n Great A-  - Graphics \\nB    - Sound / music\\nF    - Controls\\n\\nJust buy Dead Cells Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is pure and simply the best \"Metroidvania\" I\\'ve played in years. The music is beautiful, or haunting depending on the location, gameplay is solid, and reasonable easy to master, and the world is interesting. The only flaw I\\'ve found with this game is it\\'s length, and if your only complaint for a game is; \"Why isn\\'t there more\" then it\\'s a good game. A HEARTY reccomendation. Really well made game just beat it and will be playing through it again.  Only problem I have with it is it\\'s so good I wish it was longer.  Leaning more castlevania then metriod in the metrovania scale. Overall 8.5 out of 10 An absolute gem of a game with possibly the most satisfying combat I\\'ve played of this genre. It leaves you wanting more but it\\'s a fantastic experince all the way through. It\\'s a MUST-PLAY in my book. [h1] Liked [/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*] Unique and challenging boss battles.\\n[*] Passive and active upgrades with fair pro/cons.\\n[*] A well done atmospheric sound track.\\n[*] Controls feel just right; combat and platforming is smooth.\\n[*] Simple in game map that updates as you uncover areas.  Fairly clear where you may need to go next.\\n[*] It did not take long to beat.\\n\\n [/list]\\n[h1] Disliked [/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*] Got a bit repetitive getting enough money for the last upgrade.\\n[*] Map is uncovered on game+\\n[/list]\\n[h1] Overall: ★★★☆☆ [/h1]\\nStarted out slow, but once finishing the first boss and then having a few upgrades. The game had me hooked. I had a surprising amount of fun as someone who doesnt play side scroller games often. Boss fights were fun, it had great music, however at times the game did get repetitive when fighting the same monsters over and over again. Overall great time sink Great game, but the ending was disappoining. I don\\'t like going for 100% by checking every corner of a game, so I had to deal with a bad ending and it got me so frustrated that I didn\\'t want to continue and unlock a good one. Momodora is a short, fun platformer. \\n\\nIn enjoyed the setting the aesthetics and the calm music a lot. The platforming and combat are tight, and the game never feels unfair. I played on the middle of three difficulty settings, which was perfect for me as an average player that isn\\'t that much into platformers.\\n\\nThe calm exploration and setting are definitively the best part of this game. \\n\\nHowever, the game was a bit short (~maybe 4-5 hours for one playthrough, steam is definitively not telling the truth with 2.7 hours). I personally didn\\'t mind because is got it rather cheap in a humble bundle, but i think 10€ might be a bit much to ask for that amount of playtime. That is your personal choice, of course.\\n\\nThere may be some replayability in this title on the highest level of difficulty, or trying to find all of the secrets in the game. thanks to humble bundle i\\'ve got this game.\\nBut this is not a game it\\'s a pile of shit covered with rose petals.\\nNo change in the gameplay... Lame Pixel art... No story... No clues about what does this item do... And the worst part : all this fucking game is a mindfucking maze with nothing else to do than escape the enemys...\\nYou want some hardcore/pixel art/ platformer? GO \"THEY BLEED PIXEL\" Having just beaten the game, albeit not 100%ed it, I definitely feel the game is worth playing.  The controls are exceptionally tight and very rarely did I feel I died because of the game\\'s mechanics not functioning correctly, mostly just due to me pressing the wrong button or screwing something up on my end.  The story is a bit on the light side, really only told through snippits of npc dialogue and short cutscenes, but I am genuinely curious about the world, having not played the first three Momodora games, and would like to see more of this franchise.  It\\'s not an exceptionally long game, but what the game has to it is very well polished and engaging.  I think my biggest complaint, aside from not getting quite as much story as I\\'d like, is how obscure some of the objectives can be.  A recommendation I can make for those that pick the game up, is to explore EVERYWHERE, because otherwise you\\'ll miss some very key things.  All in all though, I\\'ve enjoyed my time with this game and will probably attempt to clear NG+ in the next week or so.\\nTL;DR\\nPros:\\n- Pleasing pixel art aesthetic\\n- Very Tight Controls\\n- Fun but simple\\n- Intriguing world\\n- Tough but fair encounters\\n- Lots of polish\\n- Wonderful music\\n\\nCons:\\n- Rather short\\n- Very few hints for important items\\n- A lot of back tracking\\n- Lacking amount of story(not quality)\\n\\nDespite my gripes, I still highly recommend picking this game up. owo b Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight explores a cursed land in decline. Evil spreads, the dead rise, and corruption reigns. Hope is but a faded memory for all but one, a priestess named Kaho from the village of Lun. An audience with her majesty, the queen, would surely save the land--but time is short and each night darker than the last.\\n\\nReverie Under the Moonlight is the fourth entry in the Momodora series, a side-scrolling platformer focused on action gameplay, with melee combos, dodge mechanics and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually for the rich setting and mysterious story or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet. This game is a good game. Great for those who like metroidvanias. It also has managed to peak my interest in other metroidvanias so I\\'d say that its a success\\n Beautiful pixel art, great responsive gameplay, and interesting and engaging story 10/10 this game is good i recoermned playing this with an contoler if you are useing a keybord i found that it is diffiult but you can chnage them it just a porsinal thing but here is some random lets play that some kid did just if you wont to see the gameplay first \\n\\n https://youtu.be/ywGHVqSJz0k One of my favorite platformers. Very simple combat and not too punishing.\\nLooking forward to going back and playing the other Momodora\\'s 7.5/10 So, i have beaten this game many many times, and it never gets tiring to doing so.\\nThis game made me purchase Momodra III and go after Momodora I and II.\\nThe soundtrack is incredible, what also made me buy the OST afterwards.\\nThe history get\\'s you involved and pretty hyped.\\nAll i can say is 10/10, if you like platform games, you will definitely like it.\\nThere is no more to say, just play and you won\\'t regret. One of the best games ever!! As with the series, Momodora I, II, III, this game is tough. \\n\\nAnimation is amazing, characters are fitting and the backgrounds are gorgeous. Sound is not as intense as previous games. In many ways I feel as though I\\'m playing an SNES game back in the day- and that\\'s a good thing. If you\\'ve never played this before or got it from Humble, do it! DO IT NOW!! \\n\\nAlso, maybe look into Chronicles of Teddy if you really enjoy it. Because that rocks too.\\n\\nMy only complaint with this game would have to be the jumping. It just doesn\\'t feel right at all. Like you\\'re not jumping to full potential. Also an option to turn off those damn stars would be great. Very fun and short metroidvania.  Good art and interesting mechanics. Nice pixels, good controls. Frustrating, and rewarding at the same time. Its a frenzy to play KBM, so get a controller.\\n Definitely more interesting than looks, totally worth it. 好的故事都是伤感的！\\n通关后久久不能自已!\\n每次看到这种小巧玲珑又精致的游戏总是不能控制自己！\\n我们需要更多这样的游戏，希望有后续，，，，，\\n加油！ Cool little retro-looking platformer. Cave Story meets Dark Souls. I\\'m really enjoying this. This was easily my favorite game of 2016, and Uncharted 4 came out in 2016.  I don\\'t think there\\'s any other game in my library where I\\'ve completed all of the achievements, and I think I did so during just a single weekend.  I played this game during every moment I had available.  If you enjoy Metroidvania games with an emphasis on strategic combat, I promise you\\'ll enjoy this one.  \\n\\nEvery time I finishd the game, I was excited to try the next level of difficulty, or to hunt the next achievement.  I don\\'t think I\\'ve enjoyed a game like that in a long time. Pretty animations but sluggish controls. Metroid: Bloodborne Edition feat. Touhou characters Positives\\n+Great character animation\\n+Establishes atmosphere through world design and ambience quite well\\n+Tight, responsive combat\\n+Easy to pick up and play yet still challenging\\n+Fun and challenging enemies, especially the bosses\\n+Good soundtrack\\n\\nSide Points\\n/Game length. I beat the game in about 4-5 hours, not a big issue because of the price. It has some replay value for achivements/higher difficulty though. \\n\\nNegatives\\n-No real character developlment for the side characters. They show up from time to time but don\\'t do or say anything of real substance.\\n-There isn\\'t much of a story to the game, what you know about the story from the first half hour is pretty much as deep as it gets with no real twists or character development.\\n-Underwhelming final boss. Both in their reveal and the fight itself. \\n\\nOverall\\nIf you really enjoy metroidvania style games this is an easy recommendation from a gameplay perspective, which you could argue, is the most important one. Just don\\'t expect an amazing story here.\\n This game is worth getting for so many reasons. A FANTASTIC soundtrack, tight controlls, well written story, nice retro style graphics, and it is VERY fun to play. I\\'ve heard people call Momodora \\'2D Darksouls\\' and I can agree that it almost is. It\\'s dificult game; but it is fair. The gameplay is very well done; everything feels as it should. Dodging is very smooth, attacks are satisfying to connect and movement is extremely fluid. The boss fights are enjoyable and chalenging; not to mention well worth fighting again. If you\\'re a fan of orchestral style music; Momodora\\'s OST is very nice to listen to. Everything about this game is well done, like the finest steak from a 5 star chef. tl;dr: Buy. If you\\'re a metroidvania fan then you\\'ll in all likelihood love Momodora: RutM. \\n\\nAs someone who has gone from Dust and Ori, I found this installment (this was my first) of Momodora really easy to pick up. Has really nice fluid combat that you have to master as the game goes on. Pick up collectables to enhance your abilities, and switch and swap passive and active skills to give you just the right advantage to face the enemy that lays before you. \\n\\nYou\\'ll probably die a lot, but like Ori the soundtrack doesn\\'t instill a sense of urgency. Saving is manually triggered at save bells throughout, and unless it\\'s been quite some time since you last saved your progress you won\\'t feel too much concern about dying. A number of events occur throughout to give you pause for thought and by the time you\\'ve completed the game you\\'ll be begging for more. \\n\\nCons? Perhaps a little short. I went for completion and on my first run I 100%\\'d the map, defeated the optional boss, and obtained all the collectables, resulting in the game being complete in its entirety as far as I\\'m aware. This being said, with over 100 rooms, each individually and meticulously designed with aesthetic and challenge, areas with accompanying soundtrack, and a vast array of mobs and monsters to keep you on your toes a lot of love and work has gone in to this. \\n\\nI wish I could erase my own completion of this from my head, so I could do it all over again. It was a joy to play, and I\\'ll be looking forward to their next project. Meanwhile I\\'ll be checking out the older Momodora games...\\n\\n*hours on record is wrong - I played this whilst I had no internet connection.\\nEdit for idiom correction. Well, I\\'m having fun. I think that it was a mistake to offer difficult choices, the normal difficult should be standard and the hard one avaiable after finishing the game, it would keep things more interesting. The game is beautiful, and it is aesthetically that it shows it\\'s highest potencial. The combat is fun, and the game is not hard, but keeps things interesting. The game is short, it is a drawback, although it makes up for it\\'s price. I hope they keep developing the franchise, they created some really charismatic characters and it has a lot of potential. A great metroidvania with inspiration from the Souls games.  Fantastic visuals, music and gameplay.  Although a bit on the short side, it\\'s still worth the asking price.  If you\\'re a fan of the genre, do yourself a favor, grab this hidden gem add it to your repertoire. I was surprised at how smooth and fluid the pixel art was. What a great game. If you like games in the metroidvania style, then Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is for you; the game is really fluid, intuitive and the battle system is well made, the music is just wonderful, and Pardoner\\'s Dance is what made me fall in love with the game; the graphics are gorgeous, and even though the game is quite short, backtracking in order to find all the items is still enjoyable. While it can\\'t match up to [I]Hollow Knight[/I]\\'s gold standard, this is another great \\'Metroidvania\\', living up to the recommendations that I\\'ve read from various quarters. Brutally hard at times, but never unfair - while insane difficulty (in which one hit is fatal) isn\\'t for me, I can understand how it\\'s feasible - the game is great fun throughout, with satisfying movement and combat being the core of the gameplay. There\\'s less here in the way of ability upgrades to collect than I typically enjoy, but the game\\'s fairly short which is probably a limiting factor there. Having enjoyed my time here, I\\'m definitely going to have to seek out the earlier games in the series before too long. Yes please play this game there\\'s not enough people that have played this game and it\\'s really really good though noticeably short but that\\'s okay!  Very fun to play and very very beautiful animation and music. This Game is Amazing i would recommend it to everyone for full price. It has a great art style and great game mechanics. It has 2 endings a bad and true ending which makes you kinda wanna see what happens in both and nothing felt unfair when i died. 10/10 Would speed run again. This review is long overdue but I wanted to share my short review of this game.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a fun and challenging game that feels like Castlevania and Dark Souls put together. When I first played the game, I died a few times until I got used to the controls and learned the game knowledge of this game. I\\'ve played the hardest mode and I had fun as well. Dodging one-two hit attacks is thrilling. This is one of my favorite indie / metroidvania games of all time. The story is straightforward and the soundtrack is memorable. I like the NES/piano style music. \\n\\nThe game is not long but those hours I spent were the most memorable. I highly recommend this game. I had pretty mixed feeling about this one until the last hour or so, then it became pretty satisfying. The game, at least in the hard mode, is freakishly brutal, and many of the enemies, especially the bosses will one-hit you, or close to it. The map is pretty small, so the game doesn\\'t take long to beat, as you can see by my only 7 hour playtime. Then there is a new game + on a higher difficulty, which is a nice little addition for if you really enjoyed the game. My biggest issue is that there isn\\'t a very good sense of progression here, which is a really big misstep for a metroidvania. The control are excelent and so when you die you only really have yourself to blame aside from a few little spot that I thought were sort of unacceptable. Overall a solid little game that you can beat in a day, but still get a nice exploration based feel from; I do wish there was a little bit more story, though. Nice art and ambiance, good controls and pacing. But no save point before insta-killing boss fight made me rage quit and play something more rewarding. A short metroidvania with strong influences from Dark Souls. Great art, animation and music as well as atmosphere do a pretty good job at immersing the player. The character sprites are a bit cartoonish and don\\'t mesh well with the otherwise dark and moody style but other than that it\\'s pretty cohesive in it\\'s direction.\\n\\nGameplay is quite average for a melee metroidvania. There is no variety in weaponry though. You get a short range melee attack that has a combo animation for it, and you get a bow and arrow which can be charged up for a spread attack and later a stronger attack. Despite the lack of variety, these weapons get the job done and perform well.\\n\\nCombat comes down to stun-locking enemies to death and avoiding their projectiles for the most part, or for the few melee attacks just hit them first and they won\\'t be any trouble. The enemies themselves don\\'t pose any threat to the player, aside from some magic projectiles that do large amounts of HP. The only real threat in the areas of the game are the overuse of instant death spikes and pitfalls. Get hit by one projectile and you will fly into a pitfall and die instantly. \\n\\nThe area layouts are fairly linear, with only a few connections being made between areas. The platforming aspects are very easy, so long as you avoid the spikes which isn\\'t too big an issue. To any experienced metroidvania players, don\\'t expect much difficulty from the areas and enemies. Only deaths you will experience are from the pitfalls occasionally.\\n\\nThe bosses however are a bit challenging. They dish out attacks that deal huge amounts of health, some attacks can easily cut 50% of your health if you haven\\'t been picking up the max health increasing items. Most of the bosses will only take 2-3 attempts to defeat. Learn their patterns and it gets pretty easy. There was only one boss I had a huge problem with, the Pardoner. This boss is the hardest of the game and is likely the first you will encounter once you get to the main areas of the game. \\n\\nAt that point in the game, you can fight one of 3 bosses in any order. I recommend fighting the Pardoner last. By than you will have more abilities and health. Even still the boss is quite a challenge. My biggest issue with this boss is the incredible speed of it\\'s attacks and the huge damage it deals. Just a few minor mistakes and you will be killed. You get very little oppertunity to use a healing item. The best strategy I found was to keep distance, prioritize dodging and take your time attacking with arrows. \\n\\nAfter you defeat the Pardoner and the other bosses, the final area is linear and pretty easy. A few bosses along the way to the final boss are very easy as well. There is some cheapness with the warp points in this game and you have to unlock the ability to warp between save points as well, so if you plan on 100% this, expect a lot of backtracking. The game is quite small though so it\\'s not a huge task to 100%. I got about 98% and only missed 2 items (that I wasn\\'t willing to grind for) in a quick 3 hour playthrough. \\n\\nThe final boss was very easy and formulaic. Really no surprises there. It\\'s really odd to have such one difficult boss placed into this game and the rest be so easy. So the game could use some balance tweaks here and there to fix this. \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a solid metroidvania albiet a very tiny one that can be beaten in a single sitting. It\\'s not a game changer or a game of incredible quality but it can be enjoyable to fans of the metroidvania genre. To everyone else, I would say this game isn\\'t really worth the short time or admission fee. As good as Castlevania!\\n\\n\\nCharacters are lovable at first sight but they need more development as do the story.\\n\\nWould love to see more of the Momodora series. Amazing game. Incredible art, eerie yet cute atmosphere. Soulsborne meets metroidvania. Crashed 3 times in the first 40 minutes of play. Sound effects attempt to be \\'old fashion\\' bit noises, but miss the mark and are just clunky and hard on the ears. Gameplay isn\\'t as tight as you\\'d expect and the game suffers from \\'well I\\'ll just sit here and range it to death.\\' First 3 bosses are all unimaginitve and unintersting, and are more frustrating as they just force you into corners with invisible walls or one shot you with the game\\'s clunky i-frames.\\n\\nThe art is absolutely amazing, but the rest of the game does not stand up. I finished this game on normal and it was brilliant. I 100%ed the map and got every item on hard and it was genius. Then I did a pacifist run on easy just because it was so good. And if that wasn\\'t enough I played and finished it again on insane difficulty (one hit kill mode). \\n\\nNow I\\'m considering to do another playthrough without dying. This is the first metroidvania I ever played btw. I\\'m not particularly good at these kinds of games as I easily quit in frustration once something takes more than a couple attempts. Yet this here was different.\\n\\n I died and died and died again and again, but through all of that I can\\'t remember a second of gameplay that wasn\\'t fun and engaging. This game is a masterpiece. Video game! I love em! Now this here video game is momodora: reverie under the moonlight and honestly it\\'s a real dandy ol\\' game in my opinion. \\n\\nPros:\\n+Graphics\\n+Character designs\\n+Nice mechanics\\n+Beautiful\\n\\nCons:\\n-Can be a tad frustrating at times \\n\\nMy one con is mainly due to how centralized some save points are and the distances between others. Otherwise, I love this game. I love this game to death the music and level design and difficulty are all perfect and it\\'s an amazing experience that had me glued to the screen. It\\'s a short game but well worth the money for the experience that it imparts. pretty I was looking for something to play when I came across this game. I grew up with Metroid and Castlevania games, so it absolutely caught my attention as I also completed all the dark souls games. I was just looking for something simple to play to kill time. This was actually really good and was even worth the $10 I think. the visuals are really well done and smooth, the feeling and background ..the artwork altogether is visually pleasing and overall stunning. The Sountrack has a way of immersing you into the levels as it is well done. movement is really good and feels solid and fluent for what it is. I have no complaints other than that I wish it was longer ...or they made another. this actually had me wanting more. Great, atmospheric visuals mixed with tight, challenging but rewarding gameplay. This game is amazing and I feel physically ill that hardly anybody talks about it. Its honestly fun to play and the soundtrack ......i love it, its worth your time and money to play and experience momodora Great game /// Only the true champions go for the True ending FTW. I love this game. It\\'s atmosphere is so amazingly serene and I want everyone to play it. The gameplay is really tight with very fair difficulty, the soundtrack is super immersive and the pixel art is beautiful. Momodora is a fun metroidvania that will take about 4-5 hours to complete.  It took me 5 hours, and that\\'s without getting everything.  The animation and art are both great to look at.  The combat is fun, and the items you find in the game really let you change the way you want to play.  It\\'s absolutely worth the $10 Great animation and spritework, good combat, and interesting boss designs. The map is all connected and there\\'s no set order in which to go before reaching the end. It\\'s not super long though and not a ton of replayability if you\\'re not a completionist. There are two endings, the bad one and the true one, but neither are very great. If you\\'re looking for something story and dialogue heavy, look elsewhere, but for a fun little explorer, I\\'d recommend. A true indie metroidvania gem, recommended for all fans of the subgenre. The experience is short and yet satisfying. I couldn\\'t stop playinf or hours straight sometime!  think this game is so much fun! It\\'s like Dark Souls but with leaves. this game is fun i beat the game in 10 hours and didnt do most of the secrets good game for only 7 dollers Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight was an interesting experience, albeit I found it to be too short for $9.99. The gameplay is essentially that of a metroidvania: you have equips you can buy, upgrades you can find (be it secret areas with health or collectible bugs), and a map that fills out as you explore the world. The difficulty at times feels more castlevania than metroid though, with enemies placed in unnerving locations or just very heralding jump challenges.\\n\\nThe graphic style is cute, a little more realisitcally proportioned than it\\'s predecessors, but still cute. The music was pleasant but I felt it was forgetable. The characters have nice designs, but their actual characters are really basic given how short the game is.\\n\\nWhat really lets the game down is its length. At one point I had finally gotten some mobility and certain spoilery power-ups that made me think the game was finally going to make things interesting...only for it to reach the final area and end with no surprises. I was hoping the game would be at least another 2~4 hours long. Still, if you\\'re looking for a metroidvania with a different art style, I highly recommend this game. If you\\'re not as sold, I\\'d recommend it even more when it\\'s on sale. Cute, seems like it has potential but hoped it would be a bit more story based considering the buzz i heard around it I was a bit sceptic about buying this game because I hat no experience with this genre but boy....was I wrong.\\nThe protagonist doesn\\'t talk directly but kinda communicate with other NPC\\'s. It gives a very mysterious feeling about her.\\nThe story is simple but gives quite some room for imagination and I love this graphic art. It calms me and lets me forget about time.\\nI wished for a longer story, more areas and interactions with characters but with how cheap this game is and how much love the developers put in it I tip my fancy fedora.\\n\\n10/10 would tip my fedora again. A great metroidvania game set in a gloomy but interesting world. Definitely worth its asking price, 100% recommended. Great game. it was good This is a game that draws you in with the art and keeps you playing with the elaborate bosses and interesting story. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good metroidvania game to play. \\n\\nExcellent job to the team behind this game and I look forward to any future games they put out. i love this game the art the music the levle the ... evry thing ... but this game crashes alot for me and i mean a lot i cant get pased the 4th boss becus of the crashing but i wold still recomend it there arent realy any major problems exept the crashing 6 hours and a bad ending. but the game is great, I enjoyed it,  worthy I had really wanted to get this game, but instead ended up buying Momodora III and (while I liked the game) I felt mildly disappointed in it. It wasn\\'t bad, just not as great as I was hoping that it would be. Once I saw that this game was on sale, I immediately bought it and finished it in two days. My hopes for this game were extremely high and...\\n...THEY WERE ACHIEVED!\\nI absolutely love this game and admire how perfectly the platforming, story, characters, art, and little details all mesh into one wonderful game!\\n\\nSo, what makes this game great?\\n\\n[h1] Platforming/Combat: [/h1]\\nThe platforming for this game is wonderful and you really have to plan out your movements and attacks on enemies the second you enter a room. In Momodora III, you could just race forwards, murdering enemies without a second glance. In this game, your attacks can\\'t kill enemies in one hit and the monsters are so well-placed that you have to consider what would the best strategy of attack- Should you race forwards and hit them with your leaf? Should you stay back and shoot a long ranged attack? Should you roll past them, shot some arrows, then attack? A combination of all of these? The possibilities are endless. Some spots feel slightly unfair, but not very many. Most of the time, everything is well thought out.\\n[h1]Characters/Story:[/h1]\\nThis game follows Kaho, a priestess whose home village was struck with a curse. She races off to the kingdom, trying to confront the queen, who supposedly cast the curse. Kaho is cute and likeable and the same applies to the other characters. There are certain scenes with NPCs that are very touching and, while they may seem insignificant, you don\\'t really realize how they add into the story until you see them again later in the game.\\n[h1]Boss Fights:[/h1]\\nThe boss fights in this game are actually really engaging and very fun! While some of them can be pretty difficult, you\\'ll still have a lot of fun seeing which attacks and maneuvers work best on which bosses.\\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\\nThe controls are pretty simple and you can use them differently to make special combos. You move with the arrow keys, jump with A, attack with your leaf with S, attack with your bow with D, and roll with Q. Part of what makes this game great is the great controls and movements the player can perform. When you avoid dying by rolling away from an enemy, you feel pretty cool with yourself.\\n[h1]Artwork/Graphics:[/h1]\\nThe artwork is beautiful! I absolutely love the graphics and think all the characters, enemies, backgrounds, and atmospheres are fantastic! The developer(s) obviously put a lot of time into making all of this and you honestly have to really respect that kind of dedication.\\n\\nOverall, I really loved this game and would definitely play it again!\\nThe game is very touching, strategic, well-made, and just an overall great time.\\nIt took me about 5 hours to beat it, but that\\'s only because I got lost a lot and died a lot...\\n\\n9/10, (insert joke about smacking Lubella\\'s breasts here) This game takes no prisoners.\\n\\nHalp. This game quenched a little of my thrist for another Castlevania. \\n\\nIt combined Metroidvania gameplay with some Dark Souls mechanic. To be honest, it\\'s done pretty good. I\\'d recommand for  anyone like Metroidvania. My only complain is Momodora RUTM is kind of short, but overall definitely worth 10$ A difficult but rewarding game, those who master it will find a very pleasant experience waiting for them. This holds particularly true for the boss fights. Learning is hard, but execution becomes easier as you learn, and you are rewarded with unique items for beating a boss without losing or sacrificing any HP (Some items do have an HP cost). This sort of formula is almost like Megaman Zero\\'s reward system mixed with Dark Souls\\' learning curve for boss attack patterns.\\n\\nIf you\\'re up for a true challenge, there\\'s also a mode you can unlock that makes you a one hit point wonder. Best of luck for those who try it, and best of skill as well. All in all, this is a lovingly crafted game that any Metroidvania fan should play, especially at its generous pricing. This one warrants multiple playthroughs. I have got to admit, this game is absolutly beautiful. I have played the story so many times; [strike] I\\'m pretty sure I don\\'t have a life [/strike]\\n\\nPros:\\n[list]\\n[*]Amazing animations\\n[*]Music is beautiful \\n[*]Gameplay and fighting mechanics are smooth\\n[/list]\\nThe list continues, there are so many positives about this game.\\n\\nCons:\\n[list]\\n[*]Bit short (isn\\'t really a con, I could play this game 100 times and not get bored)\\n[*]The game is a ridiculously hard nearer the start but isn\\'t a problem as the game goes on\\n[/list]\\nThere aren\\'t many cons because the game is just so good!  \\nI would highly recommend this game, especially if you like the challange! Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is one of those games you know you\\'ll like, but will have to spend some time to get used to. It is ALSO one of those games where you can\\'t really get a good bearing on if you should buy it or not because the reviews on the steam page either praise the game into heaven or raze it to the ground.\\n\\nCurtly said: Should  you play this game? Yes, but add an asterix to that yes. That\\'s the short answer. If you were only looking for that you\\'ve probably already decided to buy it anyway. Go click that add to cart button and have a  good time. For those still on the fence: allow me to explain that asterix.\\n\\n-LENGHT AND GAMEPLAY\\nFirst off: This game is a short game: At a leisure pace (not rushing towards the final boss) I was able to complete the game in just under 5 hours, but playing the New Game mode now I have been able to play halfway through the game in what amounts to 1 hour. So If you\\'re looking for a gigantic game like the Castlevania titles to sink hours upon hours into, this won\\'t be your cup of tea. \\n\\nWhen starting this game, it will be HARD. I\\'m not talking \"pick hard and die a few times\", I\\'m talking give any enemy two hits and you\\'re dead hard. This might scare off most (I saw plenty reviews on here with one hour talking about how they quit because of how \"bad\" and \"unfairly hard it was), but let me say right now that if you stick with the game to learn your mechanics (i.e your dodgeroll should be worshipped like a religion and every enemy has a pattern you\\'ll just have to observe carefully), you\\'ll get the hang of it in no time at all (again, the game is short). I guess you can call this game souls- like, but the difficulty, where brutal, will always remain fair. In fact, the beginning hours are really the toughest, because just when you\\'ve been immersed into the game and it\\'s mechanics, you\\'ll gain the power to dodge in mid-air, easing you into the experience and paving way for the game to truly kick off into high gear.\\nThe combat in Momodora: RUTM is snappy and well executed. The various moves perfectly blend into eachother. I can quickly do a four- hit combo and dodge-roll out and not receive any damage. You press the button, Kuho does the move, it\\'s that easy. This makes it very fun and satisfying to partake in the battles because you know that you\\'re constantly held accountable for your own actions. \\nThe platforming is the same: the gravity of you and the world is consistent, your jumps and doublejumps are instantenous and you really feel in control. The drawback to this is that some of the platfroming is ridiculously easy once you get the hang of it, but on the flipside it\\'s extremely satisfying to zoom through a section you would previously be struggling with.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about the bosses: mechanically, they\\'re simply amazing. Without spoiling too much you will be fighting both demons and humans this game, and both feel satisfying to play against. Each boss has its own moveset, and you\\'ll both have to keep track of their attack patterns but also try to develop a routine of attacking them on your own. They all hit like a truck, which makes them scary to approach. There\\'s always this feeling of dread while fighting them.\\n\\nConclusion: The game is a nice blend between souls-like and metroidvania games, leaning more on the latter than the former in terms of design. The devs even state this themselves on the store page. Quote: \"Momodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It\\'s a game of its own.\"\\nThis is from the last paragraph from the \"Message from the Publisher\" section of the page. The developers are quite proud of their game it seems, as they go on to proudly boast about how the game is a masterpiece in gameplay and storytelling.\\n\\n\\n-STORY AND NARRATIVE, SOUND AND DESIGN\\nWell okay there, Playism, let\\'s not get ahead of ourselves. The game is good, great even, but to call the story a masterpiece is just plainly lying to your customers. The Momodora series has never had a big focus on story telling. Yes, there were always hidden undertones and lore hidden in the game, but I feel like the devs are putting a bit too much confidence into their narrative. Supposedly, the player should constantly be re-adjusting their views towards the citizens and city they\\'re trying to save, but it is repeatedly stated you\\'re only here because the curse has reached your hometown as well. There may be two memorable characters in the game, the most memorable being Cath. I feel like the devs have put a lot of effort into Cath, I genuinely felt connected to her for the most part, especially when fighting side by side. It made the world feel expansive and forged a bond with her, but there are other characters in other games I feel much more connected to, immediately Curly from Cavestory comes to mind here. You meet her multiple times and fight with her, and she also tells you more things about herself inbetween your discovery of new areas, like Cath, but the fact that you just get more time with Curly means that ultimately she\\'s the stronger character.\\n\\nThe city of Karth feels gloomy and depressive. The barren, empty feel of the hallways and corridors, small amount of NPC\\'s as well as the later message that most have died anyway all conveyed the feeling for me that this place was already lost. The few survivors left have locked themselves into their house or fled to the monastry, but most have either died or been corrupted. This all only added to the idea that Kuho was here for her village. A shrine maiden with determination. Scared, frail, but nevertheless moving on and suprisingly brave when it really mattered. I feel that the gameplay really works hand in hand with the narrative here. A silent protagonist instantly creates player identification, and the frailty of your character in the beginning (she dies in two to three hits!) as well as the realization that to survive, you\\'ll have to be aggressive, HAVE to use that dodgeroll to engage and not run away. It all really works well.\\nMost people say that the story is barebones. And I agree. I favor playing grand RPG\\'s with amazing stories, even small games like Bastion or Transistor tell a great story with in a great world full of lore. But that\\'s not the way to look at this story. The devs state that they all grew up playing NES games. That\\'s how you should look at it: Shrine maiden adventures through city to fight the evil queen and save her hometown, plumber ventures through kingdom to fight koopa and save princess, vampire hunter invades castle to fight dracula and save world. That\\'s the narrative the dev created, and the execution in gameplay, sound design and graphics is what they poured their heart and soul into. I also want to point out that this story is a prequel to all other Momodora games (1 up to 3, the first two can be found for free in a simple google search). Yes, even with these three combined there still isn\\'t much to tell, but this isn\\'t that kind of game. It\\'s one you boot up at ten in the evening with your best pair of headphones on, the only light illuminating the room your desklamp and the monitor, while the outside is pitch black. One where you will look back on fondly even years later, saying \"man I want to venture through that monastry again\". Never have I fought a boss and thought to myself: \"Damn, should I reset and refight it?\"\\n\\nTo top the review off: The sound and graphics in this game are simply marvelous (a HUGE step-up from earlier titles), and work perfectly hand in hand with the gameplay to create a lasting impression with the player they won\\'t forget.\\n\\nThis game is fantastic, yet not perfect. But I did leave a lasting impression with me, making me want to return to it again and again. Suddenly I was that little boy with a DS and copy of Aria of Sorrow again, and that, for me, is fully worth the 10 bucks price. Amazing game.  The gameplay is precisely tuned, controls feel great, and the difficulty falls under \"tough but fair\".  This reminds me of Castlevania Symphony of the Night in a lot of ways - it\\'s basically like if you took that game, made it more challenging, and filled the game with cute pixel girls.\\n\\nProgress generally revolves around figuring out the correct sequence of moves and attacks to best get through each segment, then perfecting it as you travel around getting the things you need to progress and getting various powerups.  It\\'s difficult to just brute force the game, and instead it requires a bit of thought, in addition to some reflexes and precision.\\n\\nIf you like metroidvania style platformers, then this game will satisfy your needs. I like the protagonist. She\\'s cute.\\nHowever, I have to say that the control is terrible. A for jump and Q for roll. What kind of idiot designed that? Whenever I found specific movements were necessary, I just stood still right where I was or just conducted the unwanted move because I pressed the wrong button, thanking to which I was stupidly killed for many times and IT\\'S NOT MY FAULT!\\nAnother annoying thing is that I would lose my HP when I accidentally touched the monster and it was not even attacking me!!! Like... I just walked to a friendly monster or landed on a sleeping witch, why the hell do I get hurt?!  How vulnerable my girl is? This rule is very inhumane!!!\\nPlease do develop on this game.\\n\\n\\n This game is a hidden gem on Steam. One of the first things that struck me about it is just how [i]good[/i] this game looks. The pixel graphics really work well with the artistic style of the game. The controls are tight and work well, making combat fun and exciting. There are various mechanics and items at your disposal, and they can be used with each other for some truly amazing combinations (Check out a speedrun for some examples). \\n\\nThere is a considerable amount of replayability as well; the acheivments lend themselves to different playstyles and difficulties. Speaking of which, there are various difficulties that can be adjusted to fit any kind of player. The story is good as well, and manages to pull of some geniunly emotional character moments. I purchased the soundtrack to this game not only because I wanted to support the developer, but because the music is high quality. Overall, I definitley recommend this game. It will make a great addition to your library, and the price is a great deal for what you\\'re getting. 10/10 for sure Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a fun and challenging castlevania-like game. It offers a good challenge and very expressive pixel art graphics. Only downside for some might be the game\\'s very low resolution (320x). Funtastically challenging metroidvania\\n\\n9/10 I might have gotten a little carried away with this game since my playtime is the actual amount of time I spent in game...with some minor fudging for a break...\\n\\nAnyway, the game is really good.  It\\'s your classic metriodvenia game, but a tad small for the real feel.  Back tracking is small, which is good, but the the entire world feels a little small.\\n\\nThe combat is very strong in my feeling, fast, but allowing you to play slow when needed.  Some of the boss battles look really imtindating at first, but after I got through most of them and upgraded my health a little, things softened up a bit.  The boss will still hit hard, but it\\'s less likely to one shot you with attacks that are adsurdly hard to dodging.  As I found, some attacks you use the dodge and others are just standing still in the right place.\\n\\nArt design is very, very nice.  For as simple as it appears, it\\'s very nice, I really loved it.  It isn\\'t extremely detailed, but it\\'s detailed enough to give very clear expressions to our silent protagnous, side charaters, and a fair number of ememies.  The best has to be the final battle against the Queen (not a spoiler since the game tells you it\\'s \"her fault\" for the curse) fairly early on...outside of saying you need to find her.\\n\\nStory is simple, but it surprisingly good.  There isn\\'t much dialog, even for the final boss which I was almost exspecting.  The few npcs you find in the world (and can talk with), don\\'t really offer much help in the world, outside of one.  However, they do tell a fine story and it\\'s not a grim dark or end of the world story, but more of hope.  Poeple are trying to survive in a cursed kingdom, some turning to faith, others turning to their own ideas, and some flat out trying to deny what is happened and falling back on their blind trust in the Queen.  A few bosses straight out say, \"Your aggainst the Queen, so die.\" You of course kill them, but half the time I feel bad for them; exspecially the secrete boss who litterly throws a tantrum when you beat her (Even though it can be inferred that she killed her sister as well.)  Story is mainly given by npcs and few bosses, but it\\'s fairly simple and very easy to understand.  And for once I was honestly a little sad about what was happening to the people I had to kill (meaning the boss fights, and the true ending)\\n\\nThe things that aren\\'t good and sadly, could be better.  As I stated above, the map feels small.  It got a lots of places to go, but there isn\\'t much depth after you\\'ve been through it once.  The map is also tightened up as you unlock more shortcuts and later, the fast travel system.  I am glad the game does include the fast travel system, but I\\'m almost wishing the fast travel was removed and only the short cuts.  Unless your trying to get \"dont kill anything, but bosses\" achievement and the 100% map and or bugs achievements, then it\\'s not really worth the trouble.  The map is small enough not to need both the fast travel and the short cuts.  But that\\'s only me...maybe if the map was larger, I be less annoyed with that.\\n\\nThis is going to sound odd, but it\\'s there.  The fast travel system is limited to a selct few shrines and yet you can travel from anyone your siting by.  If you removed the short cuts, I would gladly take the fast travel to any shrine option.  But as before, I much rather have a either or instead of both options.\\n\\nDamage, this is a little silly in my book.  Every hit does a fair amount of damage, but if it\\'s a spike say good night.  I\\'m fine with bottomless pits, combat that puts you on edge all the time from creatures that can easily kill you, but when you tap what appears to be  a jaggied fense you die at max, exstended health?  Some of versions of spikes don\\'t look like they should kill you, but they do.  I get the desire to feel like a DarkSouls game, but why do I find myself dying to spikes all over the place?  More importently, whose idea was to put a achievemnt for not dying in the game and have a required pit of spikes before the boss battle that you NEED TO JUMP OVER?!  I dont know how many times I\\'ve died to it, but I\\'m sure most of my deaths were from that single pit.  For those who might play the game, you need to pause as the edge (get right up to the edge) and then jump, double jump, and finally dash across and do it close enough to the edge, with the screen scroll so you can actually make it to the other side.  --- Nitpicking of course, but I dont even want to try and guess how many deaths that silly pit gave me...might have been seconded to one of the early bosses as well.\\n\\nBoss battles, I\\'m sorry to say this, but they are good and bad at times.  Some boss battles put you near the edge of death so quickly, but the moment you calm down and realize they have a very simple pattern or trick, you can beat them down easily.  I\\'m only putting this here because I a ton of deaths to one of the earliest bosses because I couldn\\'t get down her pattern, but when I am at the final boss, things aren\\'t so bad.  Sure I am buffing my power, but she really wasn\\'t doing anything that wasn\\'t readable.  If anything, the second encouter with the witch did a better job at that.  Bosses look fast, but they are fairly easy to deal with once you realize what they do.  And sadly, once you get more into the grove of that idea, the later bosses kind of feel weak.  They hit like a truck of course, but sadly they get close to falling flat at times.\\n\\n\\nNow if you\\'ve read all that or skipped to the end, my final rating is a clean 9/10.  Ignoring my feelings about how combat is extreme damage against you and learn patterns of this boss, and of course getting one shot...the game is very good, great combat, interesting story, the sound track is incredible.  I rarely find myself enjoying the stage music almost as much as the boss battle.  One of my favorite songs happens to the one which I died the most to (besides how the music suddenly comes in the moment she looks to you and draws her blade...so good).  And most importently, the price tag for what offered, I got the game durring a sale, but paying the full price isn\\'t bad either.  The game has a fair amount of content even if it\\'s got a few flaws.  I might be interested in grabbing the sound track as well once I get a chance.  The does a great job for what it is and definitly is small enough for that second playthrough which is ok since it\\'s got those replay acheivements on it. yes YES!!! I loved this game! Its been a little while since I\\'ve been so sucked into a game! Finished up in like two days. Everything is done with so much passion. The backgrounds, character design, the music, the tight controls, and the story. I love the ambiance, the bloodbourne/ dark souls world feel wrapped around a  metroidvania  burrito, tasty!!!! I really hope they start working on another Momodora game, cause i need it bad! A very good game that challenge you,and gives you a lovely story.                                                                                         \\nYou will need like 4 - 6 h to finish the game,but that depends on you. It\\'s so pretty and fun, just get it! :ᴅ pretty fun but the death sound is the most annoying thing I have ever heard One of the best games I have played in a long time, kinda short but i went for the 100% run and didnt get it sadly. Anyways great game and great controls with controller at least. Excellent platformer. Shares many similarities with dark souls; dark themed, difficult and satisfying when you beat a boss. At the same time it gets easier as you play and get used to the controls and enemy mechanics like that of the souls series.\\n\\nAwesome music, I find myself listening to it when I\\'m not playing.\\n\\nOverall I recommend it, but it is short so don\\'t go into it thinking you\\'ll get souls hours out of it. (approx 5 hours on first playthrough) good I don\\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like I should for something that\\'s getting so much praise that I hated almost instantly. Everything hurts you. Everything. Got to get close to hit an enemy? Too bad, it randomly decided to do its dodge move towards you and does full damage. If I\\'m going to successfully dodge every attack an enemy does, but die anyway because it shoulder bumped me 3 times while I was trying to get in range, the game is getting flushed.\\n\\nEdit: Get Dead Cells instead. It\\'s better than Momodora in literally every category. This was the first game I bought on just a gut feeling, and I am quite glad that I did.\\nThe world is pretty, boss fights were difficult but didn\\'t feel impossible, and I had a lot of fun playing it. This Games art style is so amazing, the music is incredible, but sadly, I can\\'t get far because of the lack of a controller. I\\'m sure this game would be much easier to play and control with a controller As my hunger for metroidvania games burns white-hot after playing Hollow Knight, I recently remembered I had this in my Library.  So I fired it up and dug deep.\\n\\n18 hours later and I\\'ve completely cleaned house; I grabbed every cheevo and finished the game four times, once each on every difficulty.  I think I\\'ve gotten my money\\'s worth and then some, and I do recommend this as a great value for its price if you\\'re into metroidvania style platformers.\\n\\nPros:\\nGreat Pixel Art\\nUnique character design\\nSuper satisfying character animations\\nEnjoyable soundtrack\\nGreat value\\nTight controls and good platforming overall\\n\\nCons:\\nGame itself is fairly short (barely qualifies as a con, considering its price)\\nStory is... difficult to parse (even after 4 times through!  Could be that I\\'ve overestimating what was intended, or else I\\'m just dense)\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t really call this a con, but I always wish there was more than one playable character in these games.  There are at least two other NPCs that really seemed like interesting candidates, but didn\\'t have much to really contribute to the game.  Could have been a neat option for DLC!\\n\\nAside from my minor gripes, Momodora: RUtM is seriously a solid addition to your library. A short but sweet Metroidvania/Soulslike with wonderful art and animation. I feel abused... can I call child support... i liked it Amazing game. This is one of the best modern games I\\'ve played in a while. It\\'s a Metroidvania, with beautiful pixelated graphics, an interesting story, and fun(and sometimes confusing) level design. The game almost always has you on edge(especially around spikes) and grinding isn\\'t really required. The boss fights are never beaten in one try(or I just suck) and there\\'s a backstory for almost EVERY character. What\\'s not to love?! Easy to play hard to master. If you\\'re into metroidvanias this is basically a no brainer. Had a ton of fun going for the achievements too, which isn\\'t something I really do often. This game was a surprise favorite and for the price you\\'ll absolutley get your money\\'s worth. If you also tend to listen to a lot of OSTs I would recommend picking up the soundtrack as well. So I have beaten two bosses and I can say. HOLY SHIT MOTHER OF GOD IS THIS HARD. Now I have never played Dark souls so I dont know what hard is. This game is hard but fun. Every fight I am soo close to death. This game is great. Just  wish this game could be beatable with one hand. FUCK IS THE ART SO GOOD. I give it. 7 pairs of Mai Valentine\\'s breasts out of 8. \\n\\nArt 9/10\\nMusic 8/10\\nDeath of Main Character Sound Effect-3/10\\nDifficulty 9/10\\nDepth 2 out of 3 dimensions\\nController Throwing Frustation 9/10\\n\\nWhat is it better than?\\nSonic 06\\nSonic Adventure 3\\nSonic and the Black Knight\\nSonic Boom\\nSonic and the Rise of Lyric\\nThe Emoji Movie (use the money saved from not seeing it, on this game)\\n\\n\\n\\n This game gets an overwhelming 10/10, but instead of explaining why just yet, let me start by giving you the similarities between this game and the FIRST Dark Souls game (since II & III were junk), which Momodora RUTM heavily reminded me of, in good ways.\\n\\n-Both games feature no dialogue from the main character, yet have a rich and fluent story told by the splendid world design and small gists of dialogue from the occasional characters you meet.\\n\\n-Both games have a dodge roll mechanic in which you have invincibility (iFrames) for a portion of the dodge roll\\n\\n-Both games have resting points to replenish your hp and healing item, both games have upgrades to the amount of healing items you can carry by finding more, and both games allow you to warp from ANY rest point to a handful of \"hub\" locations listed by name, and both only allow warping after completing the mid-point portion of the game.\\n\\n-Both games feature excellent, ingenious, and fluid world design, with once place always leading to another in an enormous and connected map, with shortcuts that matter and feel like a blessing, but Momodora RUtM does not break at all in its map design like the gargoyle warp point at the top of Sen\\'s Fortress or entering the DLC areas in Dark Souls.\\n\\n-Both games focus on strategic enemy placement that allows you to choose how you strategize tackling multiple enemies at once using the environment and resources available, with an even bigger focus on incredible boss design\\n\\n-Both games: \"Door does not open from this side.\" :c\\n\\n-Both games are relatively short for a skilled player and can be speedrunned, but the first journey through will always be the most dear, and you will be in both wonder and awe.\\n\\nNow here\\'s my two cents on this game:\\nI feel like I\\'m cheating by having this game in my library for under $10, since it\\'s more than fairly priced and goes on sale (which is when I got it), and I wish I could donate money to the developers with a thank-you letter in a way that few developers (Hideo Kojima, Tetsuya Nomura, Yoko Taro, etc.) has ever inspired me to do so. This isn\\'t so much as a game as it is a deceptively cute exterior hiding a challenging journey through a masterpiece of art  and difficulty that will stick with you for years and years. Getting 100% for the achievements is both easy and difficult, as you must be up to the challenge of clearing the game on Insane mode, where you essentially die in one hit from everything, and on that playthrough you will come to learn (through much frustration) just how well put-together this game is in both map design and enemy placement. But I\\'m almost there. And I won\\'t stop until I have that 100%. It\\'s just that worth it to me.\\n-edit: 11/19/2019 I\\'m proobably not getting 100% since I cannot beat airman- I mean, Fennel ;( \\n\\nDefinitely buy this game if you\\'re a fan of atmospheric games that don\\'t ever pause the action. There\\'s rarely any text (for those worried this might be a visual-novel sort of deal, which I\\'m personally fine with) and the music and design only complement an astounding visual masterpiece featuring fluent, solid gameplay with tiny portions of puzzle and large elements of frustratingly difficult but rewarding exploration and combat, at a pace that will leave you satisfied, even if you\\'re a picky gamer. $10 is a steal on this one, I promise. Pretty good if you like this kinda genre.  But it was a bit short and becomes pretty shallow after you get good at it.  The only way you can die is from offscreen attacks and fighting the bosses for the first time to learn patterns.  Don\\'t do your first play through on hard mode.  The bosses all kill in one hit and its boring as hell learning their patterns by dying literally 20 times and having to run back.\\n\\nSo its a sweet but short experience with very nice graphics and sounds.\\nOh, and I dislike the jumping mechanics.  Everything is placed so that your crappy double jump just barely lands on it, or barely misses it.  A little higher jumping would\\'ve made the game much more fluid. i (really) tried to [i]talk[/i] to the queen.\\n\\n🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 The game looked amazing, the soundtrack was amazing, and the animations looked amazing. It was overall an amazing and fun game. :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: :momoyawn: CAN I HAVE THE OPTION TO REMAP THE KEYS ON MY GOD DAMN CONTROLLER PLEASE\\n\\ngreat game this game, although short, is a goddaym masterpiece. its riddled with thoughtful and personal game design. unlike the annoying roguelites out there. Very cool game. Beautiful and delphik. I like this Solid experience for anyone who enjoys metriodvania gameplay and a little challenge. Great game. 2D metroidvania with a darksouls feel. Cute anime style artwork and animation. Only downside is it is a bit short. If you\\'re good at games and like difficult games this game is kinda short for you, but still gives the options for a harder playthrough (Difficulty Insane). If you\\'re a medium pleb then this game will be a hidden gem for you !\\n\\nSoundtrack really lovely and many different items and some upgrades allow some different playstyles.\\n\\nOverall 9/11, but for the price it is definetely a 10/10\\n\\n When a game is so good, that you regret to had it for free or at low price and not supporting the team who made this lovely game...\\n\\nPS: gonna buy the OST to catch my mistakes ! One of the best games ive ever played ! The Momodora series is improved a lot from the beginning, and after the first two freeware games the third was much more polised. \\nReverie under the Moonlight is the 4th one, and plays far before the old trilogy. \\nIt\\'s a big step forward in both gameplay, story, and graphics too.\\nThe combat system is good, the pixel art is beautiful, bosses are fun and the world is full of places to explore. what a game, this one is probably my favorite pickup from the summer sale. the story, gameplay and art style blew me away. other than BS deaths and jumps i would highy recommend this game to anyone.( i found it much easier with a controller than keyboard) Momodora is great. I loved exploring the world and the fluidity of combat and platforming. I have a few small gripes, but don\\'t let that dissuade you at all. I absolutely recommend the game.\\n\\nFirst, warping could have been more exciting. If you didn\\'t see the greyed out \\'Warp\\' option when interacting with a checkpoint, it would have been more exciting to get the ability. It\\'s also a bit of a downer when you realize you can only warp to one specific checkpoint in each area. It would be better if that specific checkpoint was indicated as the warp point so it\\'d be clear when you found one or which you\\'d be warping to. I also feel backtracking for the 100% would have been more enjoyable if you could just warp to any checkpoint.\\n\\nSecond, I think the difficulty options could have struck a better balance. On normal I felt the combat was too easy, but on Hard I was one-shot often, dampening my enjoyment of the exploration aspect, which I most wanted to enjoy (That said, I appreciate the extra effort in different enemy placements on hard!). This also ties in with my third criticism being the bosses. A few of the bosses were underwhelming,  one of which being the final boss which I felt had an unintimidating visual design, and could\\'ve benefited with another attack pattern or two.\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for my gripes. Like I said, I really enjoyed the game and absolutely recommend it, but wanted to get some constructive criticism out there. One of my favorite games.  In a couple ways it\\'s almost Dark Souls\\'s cute little sister.  It\\'s tough, atmospheric, and plays like a dream. The gameplay hours reflected on my profile isn\\'t reliable as it doesn\\'t record gameplay done while on offline mode. I\\'ve made 1 playthrough on Hard and 2 playthroughs on [spoiler]Insane.[/spoiler] That being said...\\n\\nI\\'ve played Momdora 1, 2, and 3. The former two are offered for free at Itchy.io (though I\\'d say it\\'s worth donating to them a small amount for those games), and the third is also here on Steam. Given that, I was able to see exactly how the mechanics evolved from one game to the next. It thus resulted in the AMAZING product available now.\\n\\nAs one would imagine from a metroidvania, there\\'s an interconnected world to explore here and it looks gorgeous. The sprite quality of the backgrounds, the flooring, your character, the monsters that populate it, and the NPCs you\\'ll find all contribute to this whimsical mix of areas from the beautifully serene, the mischievous, and the dark and intimidating. Of course, backtracking is a thing with these kinds of games. However, in this game they made it less tedious by [spoiler] placing an upgrade in game that gives you the ability to warp between save points. [/spoiler]\\n\\nBecause of how wonderfully they handle save points. I feel it puts Dark Souls\\' bonfires to shame. Instead of having to press the confirm button and arrow keys to watch a long and drawn out animation before saving, Momodora:RUtM allows you to just strike the save point [spoiler](it\\'s a bell)[/spoiler] and presto, you can move on with your run the frame after. It\\'s brilliant in that it lowers the amount of time it takes to save while making it just as effective. They also distributed the save points enough so that you\\'re often never too far from the area that you need to retry. This means that the \"challenge\" that you\\'ll deal with have less to do with things you\\'ve already done, and more to do with the things you have yet to succeed at. This not only makes the difficulty and challenge less tedious and more delicious, but also lends the game to speedruns very well. Props to the developer for being very welcoming and involved with speedrunners and providing them with any hidden information needed to make learning how to speedrun a great experience.\\n\\nThe primary combat mechanics are well polished. You get a three strike combo akin to Zero\\'s moves from X4 (using a sacred leaf instead of a sword) that\\'s animated well so you almost always know where you\\'ll hit. [spoiler](There are a few instances that might irk you ESPECIALLY when it comes to the flying flowers and red bees that appear in groups @ the garden)[/spoiler] You get a bow attack that you can charge up for a split shot that deals more damage. You also get a dodge roll forwards and backwards with I-frames that allow you to avoid attacks and collision with enemies (rather like the one in Dark Souls or Salt and Sanctuary only more consistent), along with a double jump from the get go. All these, while in today\\'s age of hamfisted variety *coughdarksoulsweaponscoughcallofdutygunscough*, might not seem like much. However, the game uses these mechanics so well that each combat encounter feels nicely orchestrated. This will be made very apparent in the higher difficulties, when a small mistake can immediately get you killed. For instance, [spoiler] trying to maneuver around imps throwing knives and smoke bombs without getting hit [/spoiler] can prove to be a wonderful challenge. Which target do you shoot at first? Would it be better to melee this character first before shooting at the next? Is it better to just jump over or roll through this character instead? Each set of enemies in every area is cleverly placed to get you to plan your moves through. Also, the bosses are ultimately beatable (with reasonable skill required) just with these mechanics alone. \\n\\nSpeaking of bosses, the fights you have with them are intense and downright fun. The game does a good job of appropriately telegraphing attacks, giving you enough information to learn their attacks and devise a strategy to beat them. They don\\'t get behaviour stuck, they don\\'t rely on cheap insta-screen fill tactics or swarm behaviours to beat you. At the same time, they don\\'t make it obvious exactly how they are efficiently beat.They\\'re formidable and fun to fight with or without the special items that you find in the game. They are also varied in type, and I especially like how they handled fights involving bosses who are roughly the same size as you, such as [spoiler] Pardoner Fennel [/spoiler].\\n\\nIf that is not enough, the game\\'s special items influence the way you play in so many ways. They don\\'t necessarily change the mechanics of what you do drastically (which is good because it keeps the game consistent to its rules), but it does mean that each combination of items require you to change your playstyle enough to add variety. [spoiler]For instance, your first item in the game adds poison properties to your arrows. With this equipped, you have to make sure you actually avoid the clouds of poison your arrows produce where they hit as they will poison you too. In insane mode where you die in one hit, this is a death sentence. [/spoiler] These items come in two categories; the consumables that get replenished on the save points (like Estus Flasks and Bonfires in Dark Souls), and the equippables that change you or your attacks\\' properties in some fashion. There is a good amount of experimentation to be had with mixing and matching stuff, complimenting its combat scenarios. \\n\\nThe game also has selectable difficulty settings, something I wish in this age wasn\\'t subjected to the \"1337 boner\" by fans of games marketed as difficult. This game respects the needs of players at various skill levels to ensure they have an engaging experience, making this game a solid investment for even those who don\\'t primarily play platformers and metroidvanias. Aside from that, you can opt out of equipping or using special items if you want to amplify the challenge as you see fit. It\\'s perfectly possible to beat the game with or without them, though they do facilitate speedrunning so nicely. \\n\\nThe game isn\\'t without its flaws, though they are minor and easily outweighed by the game\\'s great qualities. The NPC interactions and the overall story is almost token, most of the lore is hinted item descriptions. How invested you will be in the world of Momodora will vary, as I know there are some of you who prefer it this way. Personally, I feel that I\\'d need to be involved more in these NPC\\'s and vice versa to feel some emotional effect. [spoiler] For instance, we meet Askorn who says he\\'s looking for his wife. Next thing we know, he\\'s imprisoned. Next thing we know, we find him mourning his wife at her grave. If this was a story summed up, this would seem like a tearjerker. Unfortunately, the things I just said are basically ALL OF IT. Nothing in between.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe game is also on the short side. My first playthrough lasted 6 hours on Hard [spoiler] and 5.5 hours on Insane [/spoiler]. There\\'s some time to be sunk on 100% completing the map or the rest of the secrets in the game, but that\\'s about it. Subsequent playthroughs will get shorter as you go along, though there IS a New Game + that will prove to be even more challenging than the previous run. Should you endeavor to do speedruns or no-death runs, then you\\'ll likely sink more time as well. \\n\\nThere might be some irritation to be had with threats that are off-screen, especially at high difficulty. but you can kill offscreen too.\\n\\nAll in all, this is a game worth picking up at $10. You can\\'t go wrong with this game, and you\\'d have to be really adverse to platformers or metroidvanias to think that this game isn\\'t worth the buy and even then that\\'s questionable because of how good an entry to the genre this game is. This is, by far, the best metroidvania on my library (beating out Ghost 1.0 in my books). Void of overcomplications and tedium, the game is an experience worth repeating over and over again. A game that mixes elements of difficulty, art, platforming and a beautiful story all the while filled with thrilling boss fights that leave you both questioning how and why you never knew about this game till now? WOW – this game is truly a master piece and had me wanting for more.\\n\\nReal talk - this game cant be described in words - its just really good, so good in fact that its one of the best games ive played! nigga dis good Very nice, enjoyed it thoroughly. Horrible mapping\\nthats it im not touching this lol Beautiful game. The atmosphere of Demons Souls combined with metroidvania exploration makes this one excellent game. Loved it. A nice platformer, good controls, unique atmosphere, no tedious backtracking, decent story, good music and sfx.\\nTook 9 hours to complete, I never had \"boring\" parts. Definitely worth 10 bucks for the entertainent you get :) The kind of game you want to play when you have time to sit and relax whilst you\\'re gaming. No rush, so you can notice the details that have deserved credit of the developers and creators. Beautiful concept and storyline. Well worth the efforts when played through. Certainly worth notice! Simple, beautiful and good.\\nMomodora reminded me of old pixelated and difficult games, very well done art and great soundtrack <3 The \\'Hard difficulty\\' doesn\\'t stand for \\'difficult\\' difficulty. The \\'hard\\' is indicative of how the game is going to fuck you. Hard.\\n\\n\\n\\n One of the better Metroidvanias with good OST and a decent Story to follow through. Not much backtracking and a few \"WTF do i have to do now\" Moments. Recommend to play it in a few days and not make long brakes between. You really have to watch the environment \\n///////////Semi-Spoiler\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWTF THAT WAS A WINDMILL?? Bought this game on steam summer sale last year. I had never heard of it or played any of the ones before this one. That being said I highly reccommend this game. It is one of the best 2d art games I have ever played before. There is so much personality to this game. The artstyle, the soundtrack, the bosses and characters. I\\'m not even a huge metroidvania fan and I absoluty loved it. Definatly give it a try!!! Momodora is a very good game with a solid level of challenge and some good replayability options (pacifist, insane). The controls and combat were fairly tight and overall the game just knew how to not overstay its welcome. One criticism is that the little white bubble that momentarily appears when you are charging your bow is the same thing that is supposed to give you warning of certain attacks, and when they are attacks that spawn below you, it can lead to some frustration. Only affects a couple of fights, but still something I hope they consider addressing in future games. \\n\\nThe music is pleasant and adds solid atmosphere to the game, but I would say that it maybe tended a bit too much towards the side of minimalistic at times and left the soundtrack firmly in the \"Good, not great\" category.\\n\\nThe story is sparse, and you are left to piece together some information to get something more akin to a impression of the story rather than something fully fleshed out. It works well for the game, but again, I think it may have tended just a bit too much towards the minimalistic to really elevate the game.\\n\\nAll in all, well worth the price of admission and a good game. A very polished Metroidvania title, I\\'m surprised that this one doesn\\'t get talked about much. Just what I\\'ve expected a fun metrovania genre experience. Alittle pricey though but its worth getting during a sale, keep this game on your wishlist. The game took me 6 hours to beat but of course thats playing it on hard and trying to explore every area of the map, I also got stuck at times. \\n\\npro\\n-New game plus(with all non-progressive key items obtain)\\n-Refillable usable items at the savepoint like in darksouls\\n-interesting boss fight\\n-secrets\\n\\nCons\\n-story not interesting neither are the characters(personal opinion)\\n- one frustrating boss fight that is based on randomness(easy but takes forever or it can be quick depending how lucky you get)\\n-Most boss fight were easy especially when you understand the pattern(personal opinion)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Amazing art, beautiful scenery, stellar level design, and simple and easy to play for anyone Oh boy, this game.\\nFor some reason I see people compare it to Dark Souls. I\\'ve never played Dark Souls.\\nI don\\'t really see it, but the game is a combat action platformer, as well as a \"Metroidvania-lite\". \\nAnd it\\'s pretty dang hard (there is an easy difficulty though).\\n\\nThe boss fights are very hard at first, but very fair once you start to learn them. I\\'ll get to this more *.. \\nBosses have a secret: [spoiler]Flawlessing a boss gives you a very powerful item[/spoiler].\\n\\nAfter the opening area, every area is interconnected (hence Metroidvania-like), but there\\'s not enough backtracking for new items for me to call this a Metroidvania outright, though it does feel like one.\\n\\nThe music in this game is awesome and fits the world perfectly. The world is much.. darker.. than it first appears. \\nThe story is delivered in an interesting way, as each character is pretty much disconnected from almost anyone else, they live here.\\nMost of the sound is good. No complaints here.\\n\\nGraphically the game triggers some sort of nostalgia in me that I just can\\'t quite place. \\nThis game looks like a SNES game, think \"Demon\\'s Crest\", Actraiser or \"Castlevania\", but more \"animé\". \\nStill unique enough to tell apart on sight.\\n\\nThe game has a good ending, and a bad ending.\\nI got the good one first so I didn\\'t know this until I hit the Steam community discussions.\\n\\nHere\\'s the part that gets me though.\\n*\\nThe controls.\\nThe controls are seriously among the best I have ever touched, and I played it on a keyboard. \\nAs you get better at this game, you start to realize that you are the reason you take any damage at all. \\nThe controls are extremely well-tuned. \\n\\nIf I used an \"X out of 10\" rating system, the controls alone would raise the game a point or two.\\nCombat, platforming, exploring, all of it are better because of these controls. Chibi souls Kinda hits the same part of my brain Bloodborne did, especially its weirdly unnerving atmosphere. BB didn\\'t have massive badonkers though. Fans of games such as Castlevania: Rondo of Blood , Symphony of the Night, Circle of the Moon or The From Software games series and who enjoy the difficulty of games from decades past will enjoy roaming through forests, Victorian gothic structures, and underwater caverns in order to rid the land of corruption and evil. \\n\\nWith tight controls heavy emphasis on exploration and intense boss fights, This is a game that tends to take it\\'s influences and creates a compelling game that once you get going, is very hard to put down. Once I completed the game I had found myself wanting to continue to 100% map completion and item collection, something that I don\\'t often do in games, as of late. \\n\\nIf you enjoy most or all of the games mentioned, then you\\'ll love this game.  Momodora: RUTM is definitely the game for fans of 2D pixel platforming  as well as fans of easy to learn yet difficult to master type games. Really short, but incredibly sweet. This is a fantastic Metroidvania style game with plenty of little secrets and satisfying difficulty. The art is really cute and most characters are cute girls, so that\\'s cool. This game is really really good! Although for me personally the ending wasn\\'t satisfactory, the gameplay does make more than up for it.\\n\\nReally awesome graphics and if you like metroidvania style gameplay it\\'s here!\\n\\nThe controls do take some getting used to, it\\'s one of those games that requires you to sometimes fully let go of your previous button before the charcter decides to /actually/ turn around or dodge and believe me... this will happen in a bossfight and get you killed if you don\\'t adjust your input style.\\n\\nIt seems like a replayable game, but I hope you like RNG. Pretty much all bosses have random attack orders and this could end up in your \"favor\", allowing you to just spam your ranged attack to kill them... or it can end up just requiring you to run around for 80% of the fight since the enemy is offscreen throwing stuff at you. Beautiful game, high replay value, and very entertaining. \\nI highly recommend this game if you enjoy being rewarded for exploring open worlds with decently difficult bosses. \\n:) it runs like shit, the levels are just straight hallways sometimes with a staircase or pit always with a shitty post-processing effect. the enemies are either a fat guy who contact damages you with his gut, fat guy with homing attacks, or fat guy with bombs. boss include qualaag ripoff but centipede, big titty witch, boredom,etc. if you want good metroidvania get hollow knight or salt & sanctuary. if you want to masturbate to anime titties like %100 of positive reviewers get a life. Sad! Fantastic little gem of a game; lovely visuals, challenging (but satisfying) gameplay, and quite a few fun secrets.\\n\\nI recommend you do yourself a favor and buy it. Most awesome game i have played, im a very busy guy and work keeps me very very busy so i was hessitant. Yet I am very happy I bought this! This game is able to be beat in one sitting, although it is semi short, it feels like there is a whole world to explore. It reminds me a little of castlevania to be honest. Awesome game, and quite a few secrets. Although it does seem like some of the secrets of the game were left unfinished or just havnt been figured out yet. Thats about the only downfall. But at that point youve already beat it and are just trying to clean up all the secrets and acheivments. \\n\\nALL IN ALL A MUST BUY! and its cheap!!! <3 this game made me a fan of the series!!!! Look it is a good game buy it. And don\\'t fear the enemies they just look creepy.\\nAt least you can smack a witch\\'s boobs with a maple leaf to beat her. :D\\nBy the way that fucking witch gives you no warnings when he is attacking from your bottom. this pissed me of several times.\\n\\nNOW LETS COME TO PROS AND CONS.\\n\\nPROS: Nice mechanics. \\n           Good art design.\\n           Good musics.\\n           Cute Priest.\\nCONS: If you rush you can kill enemies to easily. (Normal mode)\\n            That fucking witch doesn\\'t warns you when attacking from bottom.\\n           You can die if you dive into waters in some places and you can find ways if you dive some of them. which one i will \\n           di(v)e?\\n\\nWorth buying 8/10 A relatively high production value, pixelated anime platformer version of Dark Souls.\\n\\nAlong with superb art, animation, atmospheric music and environmental design, the game has very tight controls and decent combat. Incorporating many of the generic aspects of Dark Souls to the letter, including weaving shortcuts, checkpoint reimbursed healing items, arbitrary interaction with arbitrary and obscure character plots and so on.\\n \\nHowever of course the game also falls to the same problems as Dark Souls. There are various moments where the game throws too much of a fight out at once, at which point it is better to just damage race the threat. The obscure world building is not properly told nor telegraphed to the player, possibly in homage to the inane post-written lore of Dark Souls. And of course, random dips in the fairness of certain obstacles, enemies, and in the often human bosses. The game also has various general poor design aspects where the platforming required overly tedious precision and significant enemies being hidden off screen by the camera not panning quickly enough. This also being yet another two dimensional game which allows enemy projectiles to phase through walls, and have enemies damage the player simply by touching them, which also heightens the artificial difficulty.\\n\\nWhile only being a couple hours long the game diverges paths constantly, which can become very time consuming, confusing and tedious to constantly keep track of all the different paths and then back track to the diverging point to then explore the next path. This also being an exceptionally annoying trope of some games. It made both more annoying and more eventful by all the enemies and traps respawning anytime the player changes screens.\\n\\n\\nAs annoying and exhausting as the game could get at times it is still well designed, interesting and satisfying to play as a whole. Well worth the price when being compared to other linear gameplay experiences. Well made metroidvania game. The controls are great -- one of the best I\\'ve played recently. Even though the game is pretty short, it is very challenging. And being a non-linear game, you will learn a lot of things to improve on the following the first play through. I got about 4 hours the first run. One of the greatest hidden gems i have come across. This particular metroidvania while simple is dripping with atmosphere. The music as well is incredibly fitting. The gameplay is comprised of bow/melee combat that feels fluid and fun. Best of all, it captures the feel of my favorite game(Dark Souls). Definitely a must-play for any fan of the metroidvania genre. 10/10 My 2nd favorite metroidvania of all time. Defeated a giant monster girl by constantly slapping her breast with a maple leaf\\n\\n11/10 A light and breezy metroidvania game, first and foremost. Momo the priestess\\'s homeland is threatened by a dark curse. It is her mission and duty to dispel this curse at all costs. And so begins the game.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t played any Momodora games, you\\'re in for a treat. This is one slick game in terms of design. Everything feels put together really well, along with some dashes of another popular action RPG game series that this game shares some of its thematic style with. This game is pretty dreadful, but in a good way. The music is atmospheric, broody, and borderline unsettling most of the time. It really puts things into perspective. This is a world dominated by evil ghosts, and its your job to clean up the place; like a spiritual janitor of sorts. The characters you meet are similarly lifeless and coarse. Thematically consistent and solid is how I\\'d describe it.\\n\\nThe gameplay follows in a similar way. Controls are easy to learn and menus are simple to use. In most situations, using Momo\\'s speed and combos, as well as mastering how to dodge and weave between enemies is not only useful; its more or less required, especially towards the end of the game. However, the difficulty curve on this game is smooth as butter, so I doubt anyone would have difficulty mastering these controls by the end of the game. The bosses that you encounter are fairly easy to understand, with patterns in their attacks being common. And regular enemies that are peppered about pose no real threat to a player that\\'s savvy and observant. Gameplay wise, its easygoing.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s what it really comes down to. Momodora: RUtM isn\\'t one of those games you gnaw on over a measure of days and weeks. It\\'s the kind of game you consume in an afternoon or two. It\\'s more bite sized for a player who wants a neat little package of something that\\'s not too challenging, not too harsh; but thematically lush. This game makes use of what it has very well. Rock solid and stylistically interesting; but not something I\\'d play more than once. Still, this game wears its influences on its sleeve, and if you\\'re in the market for a metroidvainia game that\\'s just spicy and broody enough, you could certainly do a lot worse. It\\'s fun. Music is pretty bad tho.\\nI recommend it. It plays like a Castlevania game post-SOTN. In fact the theme is kind of similar, the enemies are of the gothic horror variety, etc. The combat is just slow enough to be engaging but not slow or difficult enough to be compared to Dark Souls (which is a good thing). One thing they did a really good job on is the atmosphere: the dark, grim locales do a good job of painting an abandoned world that local baddies have since taken up as residence. It\\'s a little disappointing that your main ways of attacking stay the same over the course of the game. Overall I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s as good as a Castlevania game but it\\'s not bad for an indie. Momodora:Reverie Under the Moonlight claims to be a metroidvania that takes a priestess named Momo through a dying world to defeat the dark powers that rot the land she lives in.\\n\\nWhat it does is manages to feel and be less linear than other games but I feel is more or less  the same but with more backtracking. The combat and level design is what really drives me away though. The enemies are very slow and telegraphed and instead of simply making tougher, more bosslike enemies, there are multiple haphazardly crammed in rooms, jumping around and firing projectiles, to which one might say \"use your ranged attack.\" To that I ask why? Why balance the difficulty of your game around boring ranged combat? Ori and the Blind Forest did this and it makes combat feel boring and uninvolved. Sometimes you\\'re just supposed to outright ignore enemies. So in the end, this game is for people that like Momodora and its previous iterations, so if you liked 1&2 you\\'ll like this game, if you didn\\'t, you won\\'t like this one. It\\'s that simple. A beautiful journey told in a perfect \"Show, don\\'t tell\" formula. Fun combat system, exciting map exploration, excellent soundtrack, awesome bosses, and a great replay value. One of the best sidescroller i played so far! This is a goo game! \\n\\n10/10 would play again One of the best metroidvania games I\\'ve played. This calibur is few and far between, and seldom am I almost fooled that I am playing the Super Nintendo again like this one. Albeit a little short, Reverie Under the Moonlight is well-polished and plays well. It includes an interesting story and great soundtrack. Most of the upgrades are satisfying and can be missed. The difficulty is very moderate, so you won\\'t think this is easy nor frustrating. \\n\\nJust right. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BAAAAAAAAAD EEEEEENNNNNDDDIIIINNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Short, sweet, stylish. Plays like a dream and doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. Great game : great music, good action, fun mechanics, challenging, great boss fights, smooth animations, great design, good story, not too long.\\nThe side characters felt a little useless tho, it\\'s obvious that their only role is to tell the story, they don\\'t really play a role in the story, same for boss fights, sometimes, they\\'re somewhat unexpected, like you don\\'t really know who you\\'re fighting or why. Although that\\'s a really minor complaint since the game is quick and its major strength isn\\'t the story but the gameplay Too easy to die.\\nAnd the game is a little short for this kind of gene. can\\'t wait for the next one Great game mates A Metroidvanina indie game. Art syle is pretty cute though. It\\'s much closer to Metroid than anything. Regardless of what other reviews say the only mechanic it borrowed from Dark Souls is save points restore health and healing item. Platforming is tight, boss fights are pretty easy, overall it\\'s fun for the simple reason that dying takes like 2 seconds. You die spawn and get back into the action pretty quickly, keeps the momentum going. Not much of a challenge though (so far I hope), good game to unwind to. A beautiful game with an amazing soundtrack. Really the only way to describe this game is beautiful. The combat and graphics all feel so smooth and natural. The story was worthwhile and the replay value is very high. This is a game that makes me *want* to complete all of the achievements. A very charming yet dark game. Would reccommend to anybody looking for a game that challenges yet captivates the player. Beautiful game, the only con: is too short.\\nEverything else is a masterpiece Very fun game, the difficulty it is just right and the pixel art is amazing. Good game but the death scream is really weird and jarring. [h1] Very Fun [/h1]\\nI recommend this for anyone who enjoyed Castlevaina or Metroid Just the right amount of difficulty to make this fun. Interesting story and art style. Really great Oh boy is this game a gem. If you want a solid platformer game with a gorgeous sound track and animations then this is a game that would fit. Great 2D metroidvania with a Dark Souls aesthetic.  Controls well, good visuals, challenging gameplay, and an awesome OST. What more do you need? One of the best of the Momodora series. Mysterious story but not opaque enough to have to digging through loads of background info. Fun world to explore and craft platforming. Pixel graphics done right.\\n\\nFantasic combat where attack combinations matter; no offensive or defensive choice will be looked over when you\\'re playing this game. No gimmicks or cheats in the combat, no superflashy screen effects to distract or cover up the action. If you like 2D action games like castlevania or metroid, don\\'t pass this game up. [quote][h1]★★★★★[/h1]\\nOne of my Favorites[/quote]\\n\\nMomodora: RUtM first drew me in with its pixel art which is, in a word, beautiful. What I found inside was much more than I had imagined, though, and it remains one of my favorite \"came outta nowhere, to me at least\" games. It\\'s a game I can\\'t \"talk up\" enough, especially for fans of other difficult, exploratory, dark fantasy games.\\n\\nM:RUtM is a non-linear action platformer - a Metroidvania - that takes more than a few cues from the Dark Souls series, of all things. Admittedly it\\'s a much SMALLER experience than those games with a first playthrough of less than ten hours, but it has a no less fascinating world where you spend your time exploring both its environment and story as they unravel around you. Overall, the easiest way to describe it would perhaps be as \"a SNES Souls-game\".\\n\\nMechanically, it\\'s functional and responsive. The controls for platforming and combat are simple and straight forward, meaning mistakes are your own and not the result of a too-complicated control scheme. The core experience of jumping, attacking, and dodging is incredibly satisfying: care was taken so that you can really appropriately feel each hit, and the jumps have a good sense of weight that really contribute to a good, precise, and fair challenge in the platforming.\\n\\nDesign-wise, the game focuses on exploring each area to find enemies to kill, bosses to challenge, and shortcuts to get around faster. Enemy placement is thoughtful, making almost every encounter memorable because of the interesting way monsters are laid out with the terrain. Boss Fights are numerous, difficult, and extremely satisfying to win. Exploration is guided by having objectives - usually mutiple at once, lending to the non-linearity - but being left to find them on your own.\\n\\nA small difference, with large positive effect in my opinion, is the lack of a traditional level-up system. Instead you have Metroid-style pickups that give you new abilities, and also expand your health bar. There is only one upgrade that increases the amount of damge you do, and various items that can do the same with either a limited time effect, or a trade-off. I really like this design as it truly means you can explore wherever you want without worry that the enemies are too-high a level, and beating a boss is always something you truly *can* do if you play better.\\n\\nI guess, in conclusion, I could gush about this hidden gem of a game for ages. If you like Dark Souls, Super Metroid, or other challenging games focusing on exploration, I can\\'t recommend this enough. It\\'s technically the fourth game in a series (the first two are free), but *entirely* satisfying as a standalone experience. I cannot recommend it enough, and I would give it at least two thumbs up here if I could. Fun game with great visuals and satisfying combat.\\n\\nA sold 8/10. - Beautiful pixel grapch\\n- Good feel combat / difficulty\\n- Great soundtrack\\n\\nIt would be more awesome if the story is deeper, but for now, I\\'m really satisfied. Looking for more Good game but WAY too expensive for a 2 hour game. I like the tight platforming and how the death scene goes inside the game whenever you die, along with how the combat is simple combos so far, the constant death doesn\\'t bother me because at the end I feel rewarded and none of the enemies instant kill me so it feels fair like Dark Souls, unlike Dark Souls 2, I love how this game understood how to be challenging but make you feel rewarded for overcoming the challenges.\\n\\nAlong with the pixel art looking amazing, I want to be able to make pixel art like this, the gothic dark souls bloodborne feeling I get when looking at the pixel art feels like it\\'s own thing to the point where it feels like an insult to say that, but that\\'s the best way I can describe the look of the game honestly, it looks amazing compared to a lot of other pixel art games.\\n\\nHell honestly I\\'m hoping to work for a company that makes these sort of games, well once I learn more about programming of course.\\n\\nAs well I feel as if I under paid for this game considering I bought it while it was on sale of course, even if I did pay the full price I feel like I would be under paying for this.\\n\\nThe game feels, no, is better than a lot of triple A games, which is starting to make me question the quallity in content from these companies in the triple A industry when I play games like this, I don\\'t know the budget but it feels, better than a lot of triple A games, it\\'s visuals are breathe taking and aftering killing a surprise enemy from behind, I look to see my progress, just looking out into the void of nothing at the end.\\n\\nThe lost and empty feeling I have and want to push on, along with the feeling of fear and dread is a nice mix I never felt I would feel inside a game, not even Dark Souls introduced this feeling to me, of wondering the halls, trying to find something, anything for an answer to get out, to beat the boss.\\n\\nAlong with that, I love the boss fights, the boss fights make me face challenges I faced before and adds some of it\\'s own challenges as well, taking on the mantle of a good boss fight, introducing concepts and having the player face against those concepts but with a twist to them, such as for an example a homing attack. As well each boss feels different from one another, each having a different theme and style, wether it be for the combat in how you handle the threat.\\n\\nTo be honest, this is the first one of the series I\\'ve played and I LOVE this.\\n\\nAnyways, onto the sound design and music. The death sound, makes me feel so bad like I\\'m killing a puppy, making me want to be more careful than the last time I went through, I hate but love games that make me feel bad for killing the character, as well though giving them personality so I have a reason why to care for the character in the first place.\\n\\nOh, the music, it fits perfectly, it doesn\\'t harp too much on the gothic idea but rather goes for more of emptyiness, I LOVE IT. This is my review of the game, it may be long but sure as hell I love this game. its a great platformer with some tight controllers its not long but leaves you with a satifying feeling in the end Haven\\'t finished the game yet, but so far I\\'m really enjoying it! The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, and the gameplay is pretty fun.\\nThis game is pretty merciless, and you can see that as a plus or a minus depending on your preference.\\n\\nUpdate after having finished the game:\\nThat was amazing! Most definitely worth the money, I\\'d even pay twice the full price for it. I found nothing about the game repetitive or boring, and the only thing I didn\\'t like was that it wasn\\'t longer!\\n\\nI found the game really difficult, but just in the right amount. It wasn\\'t completely impossible, but I don\\'t think I ever beat a boss on my first try. \\n\\nAgain, definitely worth it if you like metroidvania and/or beautiful pixel graphics.\\n\\nEdit: Grammar and spelling. Also, looking back, I\\'m still impressed with the gorgeous pixel art. Overall, the game is okay. Not great. I\\'d recommend only if you have an itch for metroidvania stuff.\\n\\nVisuals are REALLY beautiful. Excellent pixel art and animations. Sometimes you just want to kill all the enemies on a stage and stick around to inspect the art; it\\'s that good.\\n\\nCombat feels only decent. Some animations run too long, and some attacks (melee!) make you move forward involuntarily. Some actions cancel charging your ranged attack. When rolling to dodge works, it feels good. When you run into an enemy and suffer contact damage, it gets annoying. Finally, the way you use items is a bit clunky: you have to tab through a list of items and find the one you want. If you value good combat, all of this might irritate you.\\n\\nDifficulty curve is weird - I\\'d say the game gets easier as you progress. You gain additional abilities that makes moving more intuitive and responsive. At the beginning, it feels sluggish.\\n\\nSoundtrack is alright. Nothing too memorable, but each helps set the mood for the environment.\\n\\nStory is a hit or miss. There is little dialogue, and most of the story is told through visuals and gameplay. Some people like minimalistic storytelling, leaving you to guess/fill in the gaps. Some people really don\\'t like it.\\n\\nThe game is short.\\n\\nTLDR; Has flaws, but probably worth. Buy on a sale for sure. This is my first Momodora title that I have experienced, and I\\'ve gotta say; Wow, what a great game. I won\\'t go into any spoilers with this, but if you\\'re looking for a fun and yet challenging adventure: look no further. This game draws you in with it\\'s pretty aesthetic and keeps you playing for its neat puzzles, fights, and secrets. And mentioning secrets, good luck finding them all! I had to pull up a guide just to find the last few certain little bugs (Collectables, not like the glitch kind of bug.). Heck, I\\'ve beaten the game and still haven\\'t found all the different items scattered throughout the map! If I had to mention anything negative, It would have to be that the story kinda lost me. (But to be fair, I wasn\\'t putting my complete attention into it. Plus, I have no knoledge of any of the other Momodora games\\' lore.) I noticed that during some of the boss battles that contained important dialogue, I was missing the meaning behind most of the bosses\\' words. But thats my only complaint about this game (Which is probably just my fault anyway, lol.). By the way, this didn\\'t hinder my gaming experience in any way, and was more of just a pet-peeve.\\nAnyway, I\\'m definetly going back to do another playthrough of this after I\\'m done writing this review. Gotta get all those items and achievements that I missed! (FYI, I\\'m going to be attempting the Pacifist and No-Death achievements at the same time) Good Luck and happy playing to those who found this review helpful! (P.S, Try beating those bosses without taking damage, its worth it!) [h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\n\\nMomodora: RUtM is a soulslike metroidvania, with all that implies: pattern-based combat, free exploration, and collecting secret items and upgrades.\\n\\nThe combat is tight and clever. Your character has four main combat actions, being a melee weapon (a magic leaf), a ranged attack (bow \\'n\\' arrow), a dodge roll, and access to items (the main one replenishes health). These are pretty standard and behave as you\\'d expect, with a quirk that provides some depth. Everything but the dodge roll leaves you vulnerable by forcing you stationary (or in the case of the melee attack, mostly stationary) and unable to do anything else for a split second or two. Because there is no way to dodge attacks, this means the meat of the combat is centered around dodging telegraphed attacks and stunning enemies. Bosses typically follow this pattern as well, although some can\\'t be stunned, and have large attacks and high amounts of health. For the scope of this game, the bosses are epic.\\n\\nAs for the metroidvania part of the game, after the first couple of areas the world opens up and you can complete the rest of the map up to the final area in any order you choose (this totals a little more than half of the game). The areas themselves are filled with branching paths and multiple ways to get to the end. There are plenty of secrets and upgrades scattered around the world. These can be practically useful, such as health increases or new items, or easter egg type collectibles. There\\'s also a decent amount of backtracking and re-exploring areas for new paths and secrets, but never to the point of annoyance or tedium.\\n\\nOverall the mechanics works very well with a few minor complaints. I played on hard mode, so I can\\'t say whether this holds true for other difficulty levels, but the difficulty curve is more of a line than an actual curve. The challenge stays mostly constant throughout the game, which means the beginning is harder than the end. On the upside, this gives you a good sense of getting more skilled at the game, so it\\'s not all bad. It\\'s also pretty easy to simply bypass all the enemies by spamming dodge or arrows once you know where they are in a room. However, this is also has an upside, as it means the first time exploring an area is challenging, but backtracking is easy and quick.\\n\\nDespite these minor issues, overall the game is challenging and fun. It aims to scratch the difficult medtroidvania itch, and succeeds at the endeavor with clever soulslike combat.\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\n\\nHonestly? It\\'s pretty lame. There\\'s not a whole lot of exposition or lore, just enough to give vague direction and feel to the world. You\\'re on a quest to save the world from being corrupted by the curse of a queen. Nothing special, but you\\'re not playing this game for the story.\\n\\n[h1]Aesthetics:[/h1]\\n\\nThe pixel art is fantastic and well-detailed, although the animations are sometimes lackluster. The music is decent, setting an appropriate somber mood for the corruption infecting the world, but it\\'s nothing you\\'ll seek out when not playing the game. Solid aesthetics overall.\\n\\n[h1]Content / Replayability:[/h1]\\n\\nI finished a single playthrough on hard mode with 100% map completion and the true ending achievement in about eight hours, which is decent for the price. Beating the game on hard unlocks the insane difficulty option for new files and new game+ for the file with the complete playthrough. From what I can tell there isn\\'t a lot of incentive to replay the game outside of getting every collectible and beating the game on insane. Short, but fair for the price.\\n\\n[h1]Performance:[/h1]\\n\\nThe game crashed a few times. I was lucky enough to never lose much (the save points are fairly common). I\\'ve also never heard of anyone else having this issue, so it\\'s likely just my computer. Other than that, there are no technical issues to speak of.\\n\\nKeyboard controls are fully rebindable, but I\\'d highly recommend playing with a controller.\\n\\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\\n\\nPros:\\n[list]\\n   [*]Challenging and clever soulslike combat\\n   [*]Relatively free exploration\\n   [*]Collectible secrets and upgrades\\n   [*]Great pixel art\\n   [*]Fitting music\\n[/list]\\n\\nNeutrals:\\n[list]\\n   [*]Flat difficulty curve\\n   [*]Easy to bypass enemies once you know where they are\\n[/list]\\n\\nCons:\\n[list]\\n   [*]Lame story\\n   [*]Short (but fair for the price)\\n[/list]\\n\\nScore: 7/10 (Great) This game is absolutely fantastic, has a memorable soundtrack and a good story. Definitely worth a purchase if you like Castlevania-like games. In fact it\\'s just definitely worth a purchase, end of. This game FEELS good to play. the controls don\\'t feel clunky yet its still got that retro vibe to it. In my opinion, the strongest part of this game is that it doesn\\'t baby you like lots of games do- instead, progression feels natural! The sound track adds a phenomenal atmosphere and the world breathes with color. Highly 100% recommend this game to any fan of side-scrolling thats looking for that challenge that most modern games just don\\'t satisfy quite like they used to. Best one in the series. Amazing game, impossible to put it down once you started. The achievements and hidden secrets make it replayable. Waiting for the next one! Dead ends aren\\'t level design A solid and surprisingly challenging metroidvania. Would highly recommend. This game is beautiful. Smooth animation, punishing but fair combat, depressing gothic atmosphere. Well done MetroidVania 2-d dark souls-esque action platformer. Momodora: RutM is a metroidvania-style indie game, and the fourth game in its series. It\\'s currently one of my favorite games that I have ever played.\\nWhile the first three games in its series seemed much more akin to classic titles like Cave Story, Momodora RutM feels extremely different, more like Dark Souls being played in a 2D platforming environment, with mechanics such as a dodge with invincibility frames. I never knew I wanted this, but it feels very entertaining.\\n\\nThere\\'s not that much platforming, as it\\'s more of a battle-oriented game, mixed with exploration.\\nGraphics look stunning for a retro-pixel 2D game, which blew me away as soon as I entered the game. The battle system is very well made, and deaths don\\'t feel as frustrating as other games such as Dark Souls. The boss fights are also very entertaining.\\n\\nIf there\\'s one gripe with the game, it\\'s that the story feels a bit lackluster, with forgettable side characters. However, everything else definitely makes up for it. Also, some items feel much weaker compared to some other items. i want dark souls community to leave. While it may not be for everybody, Momodora is one of those hidden gems everyone should play at least once.\\n\\nThe art style is beautiful, the animations are fluid and the characters (even with the small amount of dialogue) have enough personality to get you picking favourites.\\nWhile the game is short, it makes up for it with a large map filled with secrets and side quests.\\nThe controls are comfortable and combined with the combat make it a challenging experience that will leave you satisfied.\\n\\nMomodora; Reverie Under the Moonlight is definitely worth the $10.99. I am a casual gamer, I dont like to have a hard time playing a game. Even though I found this game challenging, I couldnt stop playing it until I realized I had completed it. I recommend this game becuase I had a good time with it. Really solid metroidvania.  Started playing it and couldn\\'t put it down.  You get to play as both a Waifu and a Cat; What more could you ask for? If you like metroidvania games, but don\\'t have hours and hours to set aside, this game will do you well i think. Fairly good skill requirements, not too hard to beat most of the bosses, but tricky to do every one without taking damage. It\\'s a modestly short game, but I feel like it was great value for the price. Highly recommend if you like 2d sidescrollers\\n\\nOverall, great game, few minor complaints here and there, namely with nothing being explained, but besides that, it was a lot of fun. It felt a lot like a dark souls game once i learned that you don\\'t get boss rewards unless you take no damage, so that meant i was playing at 1 hp and trying to learn everything perfect. Few of the bosses are kind of annoying, but solid game, solid controls and that one other thing..\\n\\nFEAR THE COMBAT KITTEN!!! Amazing game. Very beautiful. Pretty tough, but not impossible. Atmospheric. Awesome boss fights, and many collectables and secrets. The fourth game of the Momodora series and a prequel set [i]way[/i] before the events of the first Momodora game, Reverie Under the Moonlight is worth your time and money if you like metroid-vania esque games.\\n\\n+Good Soundtrack\\n+Interesting World\\n+You kill people with a Maple leaf\\n+Fun bosses\\n\\n-Backtracking can get a little annoying (even with teleport)\\n-Certian enemies and their positions can get annoying\\n-You only get to slap Lubella\\'s tits twice\\n-Need to no-damage certain bosses to get key items to 100% the game*\\n\\nSo basically, if you wanna kill people and monsters with a maple leaf and slap a giantess witch\\'s tits, then this is the game for you. \\n\\n*It shouldn\\'t need to be said, but these bosses are also the hardest bosses in the game for some. GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: [u][b]90% YES[/b][/u] / 10% NO\\n\\n[h1]GOOD[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Beautiful art and animation. I\\'m a big fan of the creatures and main character design.\\n[*]Combat feels great. Dodges and air dashes give you options to time your attacks and the devs graciously put visual indicator effects on enemies right before they attack.\\n[*]Exploration is super rewarding, as you uncover the map to find bits of health upgrades and grind for passive item buffs.\\n[*]The intermingle of close quarters combat and range feels dynamic as you run around the battlefield. Often I\\'ll try heavy dps items to see if I could melee burn through a boss and other times I\\'ll stack a bunch of damage buffs on range to try ranged tactics.\\n[*]Music is greatly peaceful and relaxing.\\n[*]Boss fights are rather interesting. The designs were typically real cool looking and most of them varied up their combat so you felt like you had to really feel out the fight as you approach a new boss. \\n[*]I love that re-usable items replenish at save points.\\n[*]Simple story: you\\'re sent to cleanse the land and help the castle. Never gets too complicated and never needs to.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]You do have to redo all progress if you die and you get sent back to your last save, which CAN be frustrating. This means re-equipping items, re-acquiring health upgrades, and re-exploring the map. Luckily this is never too terribly frequent and the run to the boss was never extraordinarily bad. I\\'m not a gigantic fan of how games approach this, especially re-equipping items and re-arranging inventory, but it never felt like the boss runs were too heavily infested and no corridor ever felt too cheap with insta-death spikes.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]\\nAn absolute delight that should be on everyone\\'s radar. You can explore almost everything to your heart\\'s desire and beat the game in under 4 hours, but there are plenty of challenge modes for the more daring. Dude, where\\'s my sequel?\\n\\nSeriously though, this game was a great ride! Controls were great, the aesthetic is great and the boss fights were decently challenging (or I\\'m a pleb).\\n\\nAll in all, buy it! Especially on sale. This game is pretty god damned tight, and I mean that in the best way possible. Controls feel good, the combat is hard without being cheap or feeling shallow, the chunky pixel art is by far the best I\\'ve seen in years and the player progression is natural and rewarding. Never once was I so stuck that I needed to look up a guide, but I also had to use my brain every step of the way. As far as Metroidvanias, and video games in general go, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a PERFECT game. Nothing needs to be removed or added. Mad respect to the dev.\\n\\nIf you want something to fill the void of Dark Souls or Hyper Light Drifter, this is an easy reccomendation. This is very short game, you can beat it in 5 hours and that will include secret boss and true ending.\\nBut quality is through the roof, so I recommend it, absolutely beautiful and fun game. As someone who has played every Momodora game, I have to agree with the developer on saying that this is the best one without any doubt. To give a quick summary without saying too much, this game is a 2D Metroidvania style game with some Souls elements. I would say it\\'s Metroidvania in exploration, but in combat, it\\'s got some things like Souls. i.e. a heal item thats useful but needs to be well timed. If you\\'re worried about needing to play the previous games, don\\'t worry too much as their stories don\\'t need to be known to get this game\\'s story. \\n\\nTL;DR Play the damn game if you like Metroidvanias Have you ever wanted to play Dark Souls, but have no money for it? Then look no further ; Momodora RUtM is on par, if not equal in difficulty to Dark Souls. With a 2D charm, a simple story, and difficulty to make you rip your hair out at times, I definitely recommend this game. This game is amazing, very well polished, lots of lovely details, a true Metroidvania experience. \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong though, this game will kick your A$$ if you\\'re not paying attention. You will die CONSTANTLY.\\n\\nHas secret rooms, backtracking with new abilities, stores, currency, upgrades, etc.. \\n\\nBuy this game! Definitely worth it! This game is probably one of the best metroidvanias I\\'ve ever played.   The game is gorgeous and really fun, I only wish it were longer. Very fun game, I am 1/3rd of a way through now. Mechanics are super smooth and the game is decently challenging, though not a lot of tries are needed to beat bosses (so far). I would recommend picking it up if you enjoy Metroidvania-type games and if you enjoy a smooth, stylistic playstyle. A very good game, the pixel art is beautiful and the gameplay takes all the best mechanics from other great games like the souls series and manages to make it work wonderfully into a 2D plain. \\nThe game is challenging yet the difficulty still feels just right, although the insta-kill spikes can get mildly annoying.\\nIt has lots of hidden charms and interesting things to keep you interested, be it the map design or the gorgeous soundtrack and i know that by the end of it will be wanting more.\\nBuy it, its an amazing game with a very cheap price. I just wish it wouldve been longer, i would love to spend another 10 euros on it if it meant another 4 hours of gameplay. One of the best games I\\'ve ever played... ever. p gud. don\\'t watch AGDQ video of guy beating the game with 1 hand or you will be cri Loved it Momodora: RUtM is a metroidvania platformer that I\\'ve come to enjoy. At the time of writing this, I\\'ve only put an hour and a half into the game thusfar, but I would have to say that it has been a pleasant experience thusfar!\\n\\nGraphics: 8/10 -- It goes for the retro style, harkening back to the old 8-bit style of NES platformers, and I feel that it achieves this very well. It isn\\'t a lazy sort of retro 8-bit that we\\'ve seen in many other games; the spritework and the environment art show attention to detail while maintaining that 8-bit retro feel. Even things such as detailed idle animations if you let your character stand still for a second are here.\\n\\nSound: 8/10 -- This game is called \"Reverie Under the Moonlight\" and the background music very much fits the theme of the game. It\\'s a dark and depressing world, and the themes I\\'ve encountered thusfar are good, while the boss battles are good for getting you psyched and pumped up for a fight. The sound effects are also pleasant -- not too overbearing but yet exactly what they need to be. My only nitpick here is the character\\'s death scream; not really a complaint but a personal preference is that it is a bit... unsettling. Fitting, but unsettling. Personal opinion.\\n\\nControls: 7/10 -- The game\\'s movement is nice and snappy. Your character does exactly what you tell her to do, and the game\\'s physics are very solid and fluid, and consistent. The double-jump mechanic takes a little to get used to, but once you do everything feels nice. I subtracted one point for lack of legacy controller support, though. I don\\'t like using xpadder to use non-360 controllers. Platformers REALLY need to support non-360 controllers, because I am not going to want to play a 2d sidescroller with an analog stick, so I use a Playstation2 controller hooked up via a USB adapter so I can get a nice solid D-pad. So, please consider adding this in either a patch, or any future Momodora games. People like me would thank you kindly for it.\\n\\nGameplay: 9/10 -- The game is very basic (in a good way!). You have your short-range melee, a ranged, a dodge, a double-jump and an active item. That\\'s it. That\\'s all you should ever need in a metroidvania IMO. This game does it quite well.\\n\\nChallenge: 9/10 -- Selectable challenge difficulties FTW! The fastest way to make me happy. I started the game on Normal (there\\'s an Easy) and the challenge feels about right. At first the game felt a little cheap becuase it is so easy to die, but restarting from last save is fast and easy, no loading screens or anything and save points are dispersed around and it isn\\'t too hard to get back to where you died for another try. Boss fights seem a little long, though but I bet later on, after a few health pool upgrades and healing items, it won\\'t be so bad. The first boss or two, though? You might need a few retries but they have predictable patterns and don\\'t feel TOO cheap. I think they did rather well here.\\n\\nOverall: 8/10. Very solid game, and well worth the price point. The only cons I can think of, is the lack of legacy controller support and I put 75 minutes into the game and already have 40% of the map explored so the game seems a little short. But I don\\'t mind that so much, for such a pleasant experience. 1. Stunlock and arrow your enemies before they have time to contemplate their existence\\n2. Feel satisfied that you did gud\\n3. Get killed in the next room by the same enemy\\n4. It\\'s ok becuz the art and animations are stylistically perfect This game is a hidden gem.  If you like metroidvania or souls like games, then for $10 you won\\'t be disappointed! This is a very beautiful game with excellent controls and a good story. It looks as cute as a Momodora game should, but tonewise is much darker than the previous installments with a bit of a Lovecraftian vibe. I definitely recomend this to anyone who loves a good 2D Metroidvania game. SO FUN AND CUTE HOW DID YOU GUYS KNOW I LOVE CATS :D\\n8.8/10 Dark Souls meets Mega Man Zero\\n\\nMomodora is a game that is not only challenging, but also fun. The bosses are well made and will kick your rear if you don\\'t pay attention to their patterns. While the game is quite difficult, it doesn\\'t seem unfair. Sure, an enemy does a ton of damage, but you have time to dodge it. All in all, solid game. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a fun and challenging experience. Momodora IV is an adorably dark metroidvania game.\\nIf you\\'re going to play any Momodora game, make it this one.  The controls are tight, the level design is challenging but fair, and it has plenty of secrets and unlockables for the player to find.\\nThe controls in this game are really fun. The combat is a simple 3-hit melee combo and light ranged attack, but the enemy patterns and movement system (dodge roll!) really make the system shine.  The platforming is tight enough that you can do really precision stuff without sliding off of small platforms, and certain unlockables only add more stuff to your combat and movement repetoire.\\nThe world itself is fun to explore.  It\\'s organized much like your typical metroidvania game; you explore various areas of a large city. There are plenty of hidden areas and items that encourage backtracking.  The game itself is nonlinear; there are only a few segments that require you to complete something else first for obvious reasons.  \\nThe aesthetic itself is beautiful. This is the most aesthetically pleasing entry in the Momodora series, and the style really pulls the sparse story together; adorable characters and enemies blend seamlessly with the bleak and dark Karst City, with plenty of environmental storytelling to go around.\\nI highly recommend this game, although I\\'m not sure if I\\'d pay full price for it if you aren\\'t into unlocking hidden things. I easily dumped 11 hours or so into this game finding all the collectibles and beating every boss without getting hit (for special items!), but a straight run of this game probably lasts about 3 hours, even if you\\'re bad at video games like I am.  If you aren\\'t too keen on unlocking everything, I\\'d recommend you wait for a sale.\\nSome of the collectibles and interactions also feel kinda useless. For me, it was fine, since they usually made up for it in some form of sentimental value, but I know not everyone is a sucker for that stuff like I am.  \\nOther than those minor gripes, though, I\\'d recommend picking up this game! Play this. Just do it.\\nThis is an amazing metroidvania with awesome characters, a pretty art style and solid exploration. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a 2D platformer so solid and lovely to control i wanna kiss it.\\nlike, imagine Dark Souls and Metroid had a little 16-bit baby, and then that baby made a game called Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight for his preschool project. thats this game.\\n\\nMomo borrows its core mechanics from games like Metroid and Dark Souls, which i heard are pretty good. main gameplay really only includes jumping on platforms and slashing/shooting bad dudes, but Momodora likes to get a little deeper than that. your main weapon is a leaf, which attacks slowly and leaves you vulnerable between slashes, but you have a roll that gives you invincibility frames if things are dicey. your other weapon is a bow that\\'s pretty quick but forces you to stand still, again leaving you vulnerable. this means you cant be strolling along willy nilly and you gotta take each group of enemies on with care and strategy. as a result you get combat that\\'s pretty gosh darn fun and challenging (hey this kinda reminds me of Dark Souls).\\n\\nthe map that you explore is linear for about 2 seconds while the game teaches you how to play it, and then immedietely opens up, branhing into paths leading to the game\\'s several areas (which all look damn beautiful btw) that you can explore. along the way you can buy/find abilities and upgrades that help you kill baddies faster or move around faster or use the power of wind or whatever, and its real neato (huh kinda like that Metroid game hmm). the map is also sprinkled with a lot of hidden goodies, hints toward lore, easter eggs, and a secret boss if any of that scratches your itch. overall its a treat to explore and discover.\\n\\nspeaking of bosses, the few that pop in during the game are pretty good. the average boss battle is a lot like Dark Souls, bosses hit hard, but their attacks are predictable and telepathed, and leave them vulnerable to a few swings from your leaf if you execute correctly. each boss looks, plays and acts different from the others, adding to the world experience as you come across them. their rarity, combined witht the bangin\\' soundtrack, makes each boss intense to fight.\\n\\nthe death system in this game is also a lot like Dank Souls, in that you have several bells (bonfires) sprinkled about the map that serve as save points. hitting the bell (resting at the bonfire) heals the player, refills active item charges, and sets that location to be the respawn point, yadda yadda classic game stuff with a sprinkle of fun new bits. what im getting at is the game is neat\\n\\npresentation-wise, this thing is so damn delicious to experience. animations feel like they have some weight, and scenery looks pretty dang pretty on this one. im no artist, though, so i cant say much else. also the soundtrack gets soooooo good at times. my favorite track is \"Pardoner\\'s Dance\", which plays when you fight Fennel (that hot gal in the white dress and the red sword).\\n\\nuh, story, right. you get a vague idea of what\\'s going on via talking to npc\\'s or pre-boss banter, but i had a lot of trouble putting together the whole pie, and there\\'s a lot of reading between the lines on this one. i ended up filling some info with my imagination, which was okay, but left something to be desired. maybe it\\'s cause i haven\\'t played the other 3 Momo games, but i dont know. you should ask someone else about this to be honest.\\n\\noverall, yeah this one\\'s pretty dang good. and definitely worth two $5 footlongs. oop. [h1]Momodora is a treat to play[/h1]\\n\\nHaving played other Metroidvania games in the past, I can certainly say this game fits as one of my favorites in the genre. It offers beautiful visuals complimented with engaging and action packed combat. The difficulty will keep you on edge and possibly frusterated at times but it\\'s depth and player growth will make it all the more rewarding. The world is beautiful and riddled with secrets at each turn and the atmosphere is suprisingly dark considering the cute anime art style. Even though it is a bit short the pricing is well worth $10. If you think you\\'ll like this gem, definetly give it a try. This game is beautiful, with tragic lore and sad stories. The characters are cute and so is the animation. I love those games with pixel style so I recommend Momodora. \\n\\nBut there is something else you should know:\\n\\nThis game is difficult. The contact damage and consequent knock back is quite annoying. This game also has an insane mode, where any creeps can kill you in one shot. If you do not enjoy dying try normal or easy mode. Fun game all the way through. I was never a huge fan of metroidvania type games, but I loved this one. It\\'s also great how they allow the option to get the good ending after finishing the game already without having to replay the entire game again. Good game, nice branching paths, I like the branching +checkpoints system (a la Dark Souls) It creates a sense of danger and fear. \\n\\nI would have liked a little more play time and a difficulty that scales a little more, because with this game (on hard) the beginning is harder than the ending. It\\'s a me zing. [h1]Get this game if your a fan of unforgiving games ;-;[/h1]\\n\\nby unforgiving i mean, no checkpoints. just save points. if you die at a far place and you still havent gotten to a save? nope. sorry, gotta start back from last save buddy. i could be wrong, but cmon man ;---; I spoiled myself a bit on this game\\'s lore, and it all seems great. But I am not here to revel in the story, I am here to mention some gameplay issues I experienced.\\nThe game is beautiful, and so are the animations. But sadly it is the animations why I am not recommending this game.\\n\\nThe movement is nice, but whenever you attack there is always a split second of vulnerability AFTER the attack has been thrown out. My first play of this game was on hard, in hard mode most enemies can kill you in one or two shots, which is fine. But due to hard mode\\'s multiplied damage factor that split second is all the more necessary.\\n\\nBut multiplying the fault which is the lack of responsiveness due to those animations projectiles move extremely quickly and are able to come from far off screen, most notably in Karst with the Witches. A witch will shoot at me without me knowing she was there, that is usually fine for I have fairly quick reactions to that type of thing. But most of the time I can\\'t dodge that projectile, for i just completed slaying a wolf and thus am stuck in place for my face to get smashed in by heathenly magic.\\n\\nAnother problem with the witches (this one is mainly a pet peeve) their projectiles lock in on you right when they are launched thus dissapating any hope of juking out the caster and thus having the only way to not get hit is to dodge the incoming projectile.\\n\\nLastly, coupling with the attack animation annoyance. If you push the limits on an attack and wait for the enemy to get extremely close you both take the damage. This has killed me so many darn times. Can turn into cat ---> who needs more? After I\\'ve finished this game I try to understand it and I start to going through it again and again and it makes me I wanna kill myself every single time. \\nMomodora is a bit souls type platform game placed in kind of fantasy medival or something.\\nGame have really nice graphic combined with good animations. All that ofcourse is filled with beautiful soundtrack and great story ( so sad that it\\'s so short).\\nI rocommend this game to everyone who likes this type of games and sad stories. Great and rewarding experience throughout each level. Lots of detail to go through and it truly feels like a lot of effort was put into every part of this game. Cute and sometimes creepy graphics. It also breaks the mold of sidescrollers and feels like its own genre I personally think its more than a metroidvania/soulslike. gg overall Probably the most enjoyable impulse buy I\\'ve ever made. Obviously inspired by Symphony of the Night. \\n\\nSnappy controls, reasonably challenging, looks good, sounds good, plays good.\\n\\nCould have been a teensy bit longer but whats there is all fine. Do you want to play bloodborne on PC?\\nDo you like cute but badass anime girls?\\nDo you like metroidvania games in general?\\nDo you not mind dying?\\n[spoiler]Do you like hidden Vlambeer references?[/spoiler]\\nIf you answered yes to one or more of these questions, please proceed to the checkout above. I love pixel graphics so this game was a piece of art to me. The gameplay was fun although frsutrating at times. The pacing and length of the game are great, and any more would have probably been too long. I adored this game. It\\'s a 2D Metroidvania style action game that also borrows heavily from the Dark Souls series, particularly Bloodborne. Combat is fluid and challenging, utilising physical attacks, dodge-rolls, a bow, and a range of collectible active and passive items collected throughout the game. You can\\'t block, meaning you have to rely on rolling to dodge, i-frames, stunlocks, etc. in much the same way that you might in the Souls games. It\\'s challenging but deeply satisfying. The story is presented in a minimalistic way: the basic thrust of the narrative is easy to understand, but it\\'s the mysterious yet endearing roaming cast of characters and fellow adventurers that helps make this game memorable. Ultimately, you can\\'t save everyone, and you have to live with that fact. The whole game is steeped in gothic darkness, and you can really feel the sense of corruption and decay everywhere. I loved the sense of exploration and freedom, the really engaging and rewarding combat system, the diverse cast of characters, the boss designs and battles, and the tasteful, minimalist gothic plot. Highly recommended. I would highly recommend this game. The controls are tight and fluid, the art is beautiful and it is just a very enjoyable game to play overall. I really really loved that boob punching system\\n\\nyou should try it once If you enjoy 2d metroid vania titles this one is for you I liked how hard this game can be at times when I feel like the game is easy. There is alot to explore in the massive open world. I wished there was more bosses to fight. Phoenotopia, cave story, and a hit of bloodborne. This game has a cutesy metroidvania feel that you\\'ll just love. This game is amazing. Played this game without any expectations but the game blew my mind. The animations are amazing, the music fits perfectly.  The combat is so smooth, fluid and feels great. The game can be a challenge but there are multiple difficulties so players can play at their own skill level or play through every difficulty like me. I haven\\'t played many 2-D side-scroller metroidvania style games before but this game reinvigorated the way I feel at these games and got me to play many other ones, but I still haven\\'t found one where I love as much as this game. This game is definitely one of my favorite games that I\\'ve ever played. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a Metroidvania action platformer. What makes this game great is not only its fluid gameplay but its story and setting.\\n\\nYou play as a priestess named Kaho who wishes to talk to the Queen of Karst because a plague of demons has invaded originating from Karst has invaded her home. Upon arrival in Karst you find that the population has become insane from all the demons. After the forest level the game has a dark and foreboding atmosphere which really captivates you in the story.\\n\\nGameplay is simple. You move with the arrow keys and can do the following, jump, roll, perform a melee attack, cast magic, and shoot arrows. You refill your magic items and health at checkpoints. You have two types of magic items: active and passive. Active items work upon activation and you get a certain number of each item before you have to refill it. Some active items include healing items, attack up items, and attack items. Passive items affect your stats or ability. One can increase your resistance to status ailments, another can increase the speed of your arrows, and another can give your attacks flame damage. It is not overwhelming unlike other games where you get so many abilities so that the game has a steep learning curve.\\n\\nAs I said before this is a Metroidvania style game so you can go back to previous areas and unlock new passages. Karst city acts like a central hub for this game and later in the game you get the ability to teleport between certain checkpoints. There is also a side quest where you can find 20 bugs in the game and you get items for each five bugs you find (maybe it\\'s five).\\n\\nThe simple and fluid controls, customizable playstyles, and an exportable world make this game a must buy. I\\'m so glad I found this game, it reallt is a \\'hidden gem\\'\\nI love these kind of games \\nThe art style is amazing, and along with the soundtrack it creates a unique atmosphere.\\nThe gameplay is excellent, and I enjoyed every moment of it, I just wish there were a different ending.\\nI look forward to what the creators produce next. Animations are amazing. Momodora: RUtM is a wonderfully simplistic yet fun and challenging platformer. I strongly recommend this game to anybody who likes Cave Story. If you haven\\'t played Cave Story, do it now. damn this game was awesome! i love it! \\n:IF_VII: A definite improvement over the previous titles, though it leaves something to be desired. (Some spoilers included)\\n\\nMomomomomo 4 is very nice. The graphics are beautiful, the platforming is tight and the combat mechanics work pretty well. However there were defnitely parts where it seemed like there would be more to something but that was not the case. The cat sphere is a very good example of this! First of all, the witch lady being a reoccuring boss fight made it seem like she was going to be a big thing. However you only fight her twice, and her death in the second fight was so anticlimatic that I was expecting her to come back all the way up until I beat the game. \\n\\nAnyways, once you beat her you are cursed into a cat form! Which you think would now be an interesting mechanic like the morph ball in Metroid that is used often to navigate and do puzzles. However once you get out of cat jail the cat sphere is hardly ever used. If you aren\\'t looking for collectibles I think it\\'s only used once or twice after you get it, which feels quite dissapointing. \\n\\nAlso, I know that getting everything beforehand doesn\\'t help, but the last boss felt like the easiest in the game, even with the extra form you get to fight if you have the tea leaf. In fact, that form is even easier than the first two! Granted I played on normal difficulty but, I feel like they should\\'ve balanced that boss to make them at least a little tricky even if you have max health and healing items. I didn\\'t even use all 10 of the healing items I had in that fight, and I had 4 full heals in reserve just in case that got never used....\\n\\nI\\'d say up to the 3/4 mark though the game is quite enjoyable, due to not knowing what is or isn\\'t coming and the difficulty being challenging but fun. There were a lot of cool moments in the game that hyped me up for more like that to come but it never really did.\\n\\nI\\'d say this game is somewhere between decent and good, though I can\\'t think of a word for that. \\n\\n7/10 had fun but also felt dissapointed a lot Overrated, boring and not fun.\\nI really tried to like it, but the awful story, total lack of direction and overall asthetics really bothered me. \\nPeople praise it so much, but I really don\\'t see why.\\n One of the most fun metroidvania games I\\'ve played. The combat is fluid and the level design and monster design is good. The only problem I had in the game was the tedious quest to unlock the true ending. Combat and controls are nice and smooth, Amazing soundtrack, and seamless exporation. As a metroidvania, it\\'s perfect. Also, for those looking for a challenge, there are special rewards for beating the bosses without getting hit. One warning, this game is NOT easy. every enemy hits like a truck. It\\'s completely fair though. you just need some skill to beat this one. I highly recommend it if you\\'re looking for a fun and rewarding challenge. 25% cute anime girls, 75% monsters. really fun so far. This might be one of the best games I\\'ve played... I hate to sound so hyperbolic but it\\'s just that good! The game has a metroid-esque form of exploration, with an identical map, and the ability to explore pretty much everything outside of an order with many shortcuts in between areas. Speaking of that the game is also fairly inspired by Dark Souls. Enemies hit hard and your healing is limited, which you replenish at the check points you find around(you even get the ability to warp around between them at around half way depending when you actually adquire the requirements). One of the bosses has a weapon buff animation identical to Dark Souls. However don\\'t think all of it\\'s merits are by association, this is a game that needs to be played. It\\'s fantastic for people who enjoy tight combat, exploration and subtle story telling. Fun and cute. ~7h for a playthrough Short but intense and promising. Took me around 3-4 hrs to reach the true ending. It impressed me with its art style and beautiful soundtracks. It provides both casual and hardcore gameplay, both being smooth and challenging. Wish there were more metroidvania works as good as Momodora RUtM. Awesome little game, reminds me a whole lot of dark souls, and i only beat hard mode. I see a lot of people comparing games that are difficult to Dark Souls, calling it Soul-Like without actually understanding the core concept of why a Dark Souls game is difficult. I\\'ve seen a lot of people compare this game to Dark Souls as well, calling it a Souls-Like because it shares common elements. This game I can say with 100% certainty that it is in fact a Soul-Like game. \\n\\nThe game is difficult for sure, you\\'re expected to die a lot, but you\\'ll respawn/reload at your last save point, but that\\'s not what makes this a Souls-Like game. What makes this a Souls-Like is the fact that you grow as a person. You will learn how to combat enemies easier and easier as time goes on, and it\\'s not because your character is growing stronger (honestly besides a few items and the occasional health boost your character won\\'t get much stronger), the enemies are getting easier because you as a person are learning to cobat them. You\\'ll learn to read their movements, you\\'ll learn when to properly dodge or jump or cast a spell to combat the big bad that you are fighting. This goes for both boss enemies and basic enemies, since at the start, similar to Dark Souls, when you\\'re first playing, every enemy will hit as hard as a boss in a regular game, and a boss is likely to one hit you if you miss step. Because of this, the learning curve and the reward you get from clearing a room or defeating a boss is amazing, and when you go back later and you yourself are so over powered, not because you\\'re over leveled, not because you have end game equipment, but simply because you know what you\\'re doing and you know the ins and outs of the combat system is an incredible and impowering feeling.\\n\\nOne thing that also really reminded me of Dark Souls 1 specifically from this game was the way the world worked. For those who haven\\'t played Dark Souls 1 the lore is very interesting and well thought out, but you really have to look for the lore, either by talking to characters in a specific way, exploring, or reading item descriptions. In this game I really got that feeling back because of the short but detailed descriptions that each item has that tells you a bit about the world you are living in. In addition, talking to NPCs, reading boss names, and hearing NPCs talking about other bosses really fills you in on how startlingly detailed this world is despite being such a small game.\\n\\nI remember when I first played this game, having not played 2d platformer adventures in ten years, I was incredibly annoyed at the fact that when an enemy touched me, or when I touched an enemy I would take damage, but as the game goes on you start to learn how to dodge, and how to make it so you never accidentally touch an enemy. I also remember how badass I felt playing this game simply because of how nice, simple, and responsive the controls are. Beating one enemy down with a leaf before immidately turning around and killing another enemy with your bow from off screen is an amazing feeling.\\n\\nNow there\\'s only one problem I had with the game and I wouldn\\'t say this is a problem as much as just something that might need to be looked at. I used a controller for most of this game because it\\'s easier, but the menu has the controlls of the controller a bit off.\\nThe menu says:\\nLB: switch item\\nRB: ranged attack\\nA: jump\\nB: roll\\nX: melee attack\\nY: use item\\nand then the control stick to move about.\\n\\nWhat the control scheme actually is (at least for my game for some reason, and i wasn\\'t using a program like Antimicro or anything, just the base game\\'s controller)\\nRight Trigger: switch item\\nRB: use item\\nA: jump\\nB: Roll\\nX: Melee attack\\nY: ranged attack\\nAnd then the control stick to move about.\\n\\nIt\\'s just a minor thing, but if someone decided to switch to controller and didn\\'t decide to try out every button before hand in a safe zone they might be in for a bit of a surprise. In addition, and this is just a small thing and i\\'m not 100% sure how simple it is to program, but I noticed that you couldn\\'t change the control scheme for the controller. You can for the Keyboard, but not for the controller. For that you would have to use a program like Antimicro. \\n\\nSo finally, if it wasn\\'t obvious, I love this game. I really enjoyed it. I picked it up thinking \"hey I kinda want to play a side scrolling platformer.\" and fell in love. This game is amazing, fun, interesting, and absolutely wonderful. I don\\'t think there\\'s a single character I hate, because even the ones you\\'re supposed to hate I loved. So if you like hard but rewarding games with empowering combat and platforming then this game is definitely for you, if it\\'s not, I\\'d advise at least picking it up when its on sale cause this game is a real treat. Great pixel art, soundtrack and difficulty. Highly recommended A short but sweet intense action platformer. Great atmosphere and gameplay. Satisfying exploration and challenge. Definitely worth checking out. Woooooooooo.\\nI like to describe myself as a really picky bastard because I find it really difficult to enjoy a lot of games. Seeing the flaws in games is one of my favourite things to do which goes hand-in-hand with my really picky tastes. Now enter Momo4a which has little-to-no flaws for me to complain about being accompanied with some of the most beautiful pixel art and polished gameplay imaginable. Naturally, I love the ever-loving crap out of this game. But why am I giving it a negative review? Because it has arguably one of the worst plots I\\'ve ever played through, and this was the straw that broke the camel\\'s back for me.\\n\\nMomo4a is the fourth installment in the Momodora franchise but has little connection to its previous games since it\\'s a prequel of sorts. Playing as a priestess named \\'Kaho\\', who is of course neither Momo or Dora. Story-wise there\\'s a lot to be desired. A basic plotline of \\'Save your village from the curse by getting the Queen\\'s help!\\' sets you into a good adventure that\\'ll last you about 5-6 hours in your first playthrough. There is almost nothing when it comes to a story in this game, items yield brief descriptions of what they come from and/or what they do, boss-specific items tell you literally nothing about the boss itself and how it originated, large amounts of locations seem relatively unaffected by the apparent \\'curse\\' in this game. \"OH BUT YOU DON\\'T KNOW WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE BEFORE THEY WERE CORRUPTED!\". Please, it\\'s ridiculous when you go to the garden area for it to still look like a normal garden with any form of corruption to it at all. Same with other locations in the game, for example, the dungeon emerged in water would probably still look how it was in the game without the so-called curse that\\'s ruining everything.\\n\\nOn another note, the bosses. The bosses make up the main real \\'plot\\' of this game when enemy-types that don\\'t really fit are shoved all over the place (seriously, a floating catgirl with a scythe in a submerged dungeon?). Some characters seem somewhat fitting in place of the story, Pardoner Fennel & Archpriest Choir made some relative sense when you put two-and-two together. But other bosses were just wildly out of place. An unnamed angel boss which served no purpose except to show off a mimic/ghost mechanic that literally only it could use the entire time, Lubella the giant blue demon lady who showed up a total of two times (more than anybody else the entire game) and then seemingly disappeared which makes you wonder \\'Why didn\\'t she die during the first fight?\\'. Lastly the Derelict ghost duck that shows up once serving no plotpoint at all except \\'So this location can have a boss fight.\\' These three bosses among a few others were so useless and honestly could of easily been tied in with the rest of the story. And I mean a whole lot more than just \\'oh thank god they died!\\'. Where did they come from? Who & What are they? What do they have to do with the curse?\\n\\nThis all adds up and emersion or any form of engrossing yourself into the game takes a massive hit because of it. While yes, the locations are pretty, they don\\'t look remotely destroyed or cursed in the slightest, half the bosses barely fit into the narrative and even some of the enemy types just don\\'t match their environment. \\nGood gameplay is lovely, fantastic even, with an amazing soundtrack and beautiful world, it\\'s easy for anybody to love this game. But it\\'s so difficult to enjoy it when you have these red flags stopping you from being engaged with the game. Lots of fun, even if it\\'s on a bit of the short side. Fluid gameplay, good exploration, excellent and adorable characters! This is an extremely good metroidvania.  Beautiful design through and through.  Highly recommended. Momodora: RUtM is basically a 2D, 16-bit Bloodborne clone. If that sounds appealing, buy it. If that sounds confusing, continue reading and I\\'ll elaborate.\\n[list]\\n[*]The game is dark, gothic, and brimming with psychological horror and depressing themes. The godly mellow soundtrack just improves on this even further.\\n[*]Combat is centered around dodging and stunlocking enemies, there\\'s no way to block attacks. You have an incredibly fast ranged attack in your longbow, but using it makes you stationary, so you need to time using it well. Same thing with healing: it\\'s very fast, but it will lock you in place long enough for enemies to hit you unless you time it properly.\\n[*]There\\'s a lot of hidden secrets, including shortcuts, HP upgrades, equipment that can change your playstyle considerably, and hidden Ivory Bugs that are 1 pixel big and traded in with a collector for various rewards.\\n[*]The game is incredibly free, once you reach a certain point you can take on all areas in any order.\\n[*]There\\'s a lot of missable optional content, and that coupled with the freeform structure adds a lot of replay value.\\n[*]The game has gotten a lot of updates with things most other devs wouldn\\'t even consider, like tweaks to reduce photosensitivity epilepsy trigger rate in some effects and a [i]danish[/i] localization.\\n[/list]\\nIt\\'s a bit short, but considering the amount of hidden stuff to find it can give you way more playtime than it initially seems. And I\\'ve seriously spent more time with some of these bosses than it took to get past some bosses in Dark Souls 2 and 3.\\n\\nOverall this game is definitely worth getting if you\\'re into soulslikes, metroidvanias or bullet hell games: it has reasonable chunks of each and is a huge step up from its (already amazing) predecessors Modora I - III. A leaf does not make a good weapon i should know. Great game. New to the series so wasn\\'t sure what to expect but it has certainly surpassed any expectations I may have had. I see a lot of praise/scorn written about how hard it is, but I\\'ve played a fair bit and gotten through 4 bosses without much hassle. It feels more like an old school Megaman game to me but with definite Metroid over tones. \\n\\nIf I had to find some negatives about the game I\\'d say that the small aspect ratio is a bit of a downer and the story hasn\\'t really grabbed me so far, but these aren\\'t major things for me. This game is another \"Hidden Jem\" in my opinion, I have not played any of the other games in the series, however, this is a fantastic game.  Beautiful visuals and music, challenging combat, multiple cats, and just very fun to play.  I completed this game on normal, and it\\'s a damn good time.  While people compare this game to be a \"souls like\" I just think it\\'s pretty fun.  Probably one of my favorite games of 2016 and ever. Great metroidvania game, with a lot of depth. Good map, good gameplay, really a nice surprise. It took me about 7 hours to reveal 100% of the map on normal difficulty (which I think is actually a nice thing, I prefer a short but intesne experience over a long but boring game). Good job devs, I had a great time! At my first playthrough, i felt like anything could be around the next corner/zone was challenging, charming and great exploration experiance. \\n\\nAs a Dark Souls fan i felt right in place with the setting and the game itself and I would recommend it to anyone that likes similar games. Despite it\\'s short playthough (played it on easy due to backlog, although it should still be short on more harder difficulties), it\\'s extremely polished with it\\'s gameplay, level and art design. The OST is in all levels excellent and if catchy too. Also, the most interesting aspect of this game is it\\'s deception of cutesy art with subtle but effective tones of dark and morbid presentation with characters, although not showing much of the story around, show their desperation and actions amidst the events of the curse that has taken their city. The battles are hard and won\\'t let you fight them by simply mashing the button, but rely more on the wits and patience of the player to strike hits and to evade attacks. The bosses are very well made and diverse too. \\n\\nIn sum, an excellent game for your collection regardless if you know the rest of the series and even more so if you\\'re a fan of the Metroidvania genre. I\\'d love to see more of the series and even more, get to meet the authors of this wonderful game which is a worthy note in the history of Brazilian Game Development. Honestly a really good game, i loved it. I personally can\\'t say much without spoiling it but i\\'d say its worth the buy, i know i have little time in it but i plan to play much more into to fully explore it. If you get it, play it on hard. Much more fulfilling and it won\\'t feel like a waste of time when you complete it. Great pixelart, music, and gameplay Fun little metroid-vania style game. 10/10 dirty shrooms Pros:\\nHas a cat.\\nBig monsters have boobs.\\nPunishing enough to make you blush.\\n\\nCons:\\nNo sequel yet.\\n\\n10/10 Would play a sequel. Awesome, definitely worth your time. Perfect little cute game. Great game. Fun, short, gorgeous, metrovania with some weaboo. Matches made in heaven Very nice game Kind of like Castlevania, but with characters that belong in a Touhou game. It\\'s pretty short, but a lot of fun. I had no idea this is a souls-like! How awesome is that? It also nails the Souls-like aspects. It also has good platforming mechanics, beautiful pixel art and nice music. Damn good game. Don\\'t be like me and think it\\'s just a cute little thing. It\\'s worth playing! Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a 2D metroidvania developed by a small team which draws inspiration from the genre definers as well as Dark Souls. The game is short, a first play-through on normal difficulty will run you about 4 to 5 hours. I just finished the game and then spent a good amount of time reading some other reviews and comments from reddit threads. I was surprised to see so many comments praising the game as \\'one of the greatest metroidvanias of all time\\' and other such hyperbole, the professional reviews that I found were more lukewarm, and I think metacritic has the right of it - somewhere in the 70\\'s out of 100. The game is successful in many aspects but stands out in almost none. It checks all of the boxes and is mechanically sound but suffers from a dearth of ideas. It\\'s a good metroidvania game, but is definitely not a great one. Let me break it down.\\nCombat\\nThis is the best part of the game. combat is simple but engaging and tight. You have a simple melee attack, a ranged attack (which can be charged), and some usable items which are largely useless except in some boss battles because they are mostly very slow AoEs. You have a dodgeroll with invincibility frames which the game forces you to use during the intense boss battles, defeating them is, like Dark Souls or Monster Hunter, about learning their tells and avoiding their attacks. The combat during the regular map traversal becomes stale and repetitive towards the end of the playthrough, which as I stated earlier, is quite short. Combat becomes either rush and attack the enemy before they begin their attack animation, or just run/dodge past them if you don\\'t need any money. All in all, the combat is well-done and gratifying.\\nNavigation\\nNavigation is a big part of any metroidvania, and Momodora\\'s is pretty skin-deep. You\\'ll never find yourself lost and branching paths either quickly re-join or lead to some dead end. You mostly move forward, checking little side-rooms and then going on your way. After the first little area, much of the rest of the game can be explored in any order, so its not really \"linear\", but each individual area is quite linear. The map also auto-fills as you enter new rooms and shows where you can exit/continue. There is not much back-tracking in the game except after you get one item which grants you the ability to enter areas which you previously passed but couldnt enter, and then again to get 1 more item needed for the \"true ending\". Speaking of endings:\\nthe plot\\nagain, skin-deep. there are quite a few NPCs but none of them say more than a few sentences, and most of them add nothing to the plot or story. perhaps I missed something important or failed to meet some requirement for some of the NPCs to meaningfully communicate to me but NPCs were forgettable and some referenced other NPCs who I had forgotten entirely. None of the characters are actually fleshed out and there are no emotional moments in the game. There is a death of an NPC in the game, you come across them a few times and then come across them later, fatally stricken during some off-camera event. Was I supposed to feel something? Was I supposed to care about this character? I didn\\'t. The story goes nowhere, no twist. You are dropped off on the bank of a river and basically told you need to go kill this evil queen. Then, you go and kill the evil queen. Game over.\\ngraphics and sound\\nthe game is beautiful. I didn\\'t play any of the previous Momodora games but looking at the trailer for the previous one, III, on steam, RutM is a huge step up. It\\'s charming and colorful, and fun to behold. The animations are fluid and the screen shake/particle effects and such are well done. The music is pretty meh, and the sound design overall is pretty meh. Its not terrible, in fact its impressive what such a small team have created, but its nothing really special either.\\nloose thoughts\\nthe game uses a Souls-game style checkpoint system where when you die you re-spawn at bells (not bonfires) and visiting a bell also restores all of your consumables. The restorable consumables is a good idea that works great, you can never have way too many health items, offensive spells, buffs. That was a game mechanic triumph for sure. However, the checkpoint system can also make parts of the game feel quite tedious. There are lots of insta-kill spike pit traps and falling into one and being sent all the way back to a bell can make parts of the game feel like a chore, the platforming isn\\'t particularly gratifying or fleshed out mechanically. in my opinion making a platforming death send you back to the beginning of a room and lose some health rather than going back to a bell would have made the game better.\\nconclusion\\nthis game feels like a developer finally getting into his groove, making something aesthetically beautiful and mechanically impressive. Unfortunately, the end result is more of a glorified demo than a fully fleshed out game. The plot is little more than a premise which isn\\'t adequately explored, the combat is fun but unvaried, for a game in a genre about exploration the map is disappointingly straightforward. I hoped that perhaps for his next project the developer would perhaps work with a game designer and writer to make a truly great 2D metroidvania, but unfortunately I just found that he is working on a 3D action/adventure.  looks pretty rough.  \\nmy final verdict: I guess it\\'s worth $10, and certainly worth anything less than that, but don\\'t go in expecting something amazing. It\\'s a testament to what could have been. cest la vie. Momodora: RutM is honestly one of the best metroidvania titles I\\'ve ever played. Excellent controls, top notch visuals, great music and a game that\\'s perfectly paced, balanced and presented. It\\'s Castlevania: SoTN meets Dark Souls and it\\'s a game that will easily stand the test of time. If you enjoy metroidvania games, this is a must-buy. it\\'s like a platformer but finally good Another Dark Souls inspired platformer, with fantastically executed music, art, and gameplay. \\n\\n10/10 would buy again. Really enjoyable metroidvania with tight controls, combat feels almost darksoulsy, and the checkpoint/healing item system is definatly in that style. The atmosphere is great, the gameplay is fun and the story while not incredibly deep, was interesting. Only real problem could be considered that it is fairly short, though still a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. This game is harder than my exam on geography but needless to say this game is the best i\\'ve seen for awhile 2D Dark Souls, but like true dark souls not that broken ds2/ds3 games.\\n\\n9.5/10 for me.\\n\\n- Strong solid atmosphere.\\n- Some really working Dark Souls mechanics mixed with Momodora\\'s ones.\\n- Challenging and enjoyable gameplay.\\n- Fun and memorable characters.\\n- Juicy graphics.\\n- A lot of secrets and exploration for such game.\\n\\nThis game inspired me to resurrect my own project from the dead. I have regained faith in Indie Gamedev once again. And that is my personal motives of thanking the developers, well done guys. Would [h1]LOVE[/h1] to see Momodora 5.\\n\\n:momocat: This game has great combat and bosses. It seems incredibly difficutl at first, but as you start to understand the enemies\\' attack patterns as well as your own tools battles becomes fun. Neither combat nor exploration ever feel like a chore.\\n\\nThe map is built in such a way that going back and forth to areas you\\'ve already visited never feels like a pain, and as you unlock more skills traveling becomes faster. Not to mention how beautiful the environments, music and character animations are. A nicely made and really good game.\\nA bit Souls like, a bit metroïvania style. Really nice combat mechanic make some boss fight epic with the Soundtrack wich is mesmerizing. plus a nice story and some well made character. 9/10 This game is so much fun yet challenging. I personally i love this game and i would recommend it if your into metroidvanias. The art is Fantastic and so is the story the soundtrack is great. The thing i most enjoy about this game is the story and the well designed boss battles Really fun and challenging game! Has a dark souls esk atmosphere to it, making it even better.  Really wish there were more areas to travel go to. Absolutely loved this game. What a wonderful hidden gem. good Although it is hard and you probably won\\'t succeed in the first try, defeating the oponnents is very satisfying.\\nDeath is punishing, but not frustrating. Not many games can get this right.\\nPlus: Great graphics and soundtrack Even with the good reviews and the gameplay footage I wasn\\'t too sure what to expect. What I found was a crisp and simple game that hit all the right notes. Here\\'s the breakdown:\\n\\nThe Good - The controls are nice and tight, which is essential for games with platforming like this one. I found myself able to jump onto tiny platforms and spaces without much difficulty even early on in the game. The combat controls are also exactly right. I also appreciated the simplicity of the game overall, with just the right number of items to collect, just the right amount of ambiance without getting heavy handed in the styling, and just enough of a story to make the game feel like it has some sort of purpose without it being a slog through piles of pointless dialouge.\\n\\nThe Bad - I wish the game had widescreen support, but that is more of a wish than a complaint. Otherwise there is not much else to mention here. As long as you are comfortable with the fact that this is a relatively simple title, and you are a fan of Metroidvania style adventuring and platforming, you will not find anything here to rub you the wrong way.\\n\\nThe Verdict - Fair warning, the learning curve is just a little bit steep in the beginning, but by the end of your first playthrough you will just float through the game. Not many titles manage to hit that sweet spot, and this game surprised me in that way. The whole thing is well designed, even if it doesn\\'t necessarily add anything to the genre. So, if everything I have mentioned so far really connects with you then I think you will like this title too. Amazing. Amazing little gem with so many secrets packed in that it seems to almost explode from it.\\n\\nThe whole world is connected with it in pretty clever ways, making exploring pretty fun. You will often find yourself in old places again after finishing a boss or unlocking one of many shortcuts.\\n\\nThe way the secret ending is hidden \"could\" have been done better. But atleast it wasn\\'t too hidden, making it unlocking the true ending pretty simple for many folk. Highly recommend this game (mostly). It has very balanced difficulty to keep it interesting. The art and environments are fantastic. The level designs are great. It\\'s quite fun and I couldn\\'t stop playing it. Despite the boss battles being quite hard, I did enjoy the challenge. The gameplay/mechanics are fantastic - feel a bit like a ninja - and cool that you can become a cat to get into new areas.\\nMy only complaint was I personally didn\\'t enjoy the story as much as I would have hoped - but I notice a lot of other people did. Usually when I work hard to beat a game I hope for a really good ending and felt a bit let down in that regard... but I enjoy the game enough that I\\'d play through it again - no doubt about it. I\\'d get a sequel to this for sure. I bought this game because it looked pretty and it didn\\'t fail in that respect. The different areas are all distinct, but still feel cohesive and are all a pleasure to explore. The music is also great and really lends itself to create a game with a lot of atmostphere. Everything feels desolate and a little bit oppressive, and I love it.\\n\\nSomething that I didn\\'t expect though is the difficulty of the game. It looks like it willl be a cakewalk, but no. This game is unforgiving and really requires players to be vigilant, and purposeful with their actions. You will die. You will have to try over and over to get through some parts. You may even need to walk away for a while to cool your head. But the game is fair in its difficulty. When you mess up you\\'ll be able to tell why, and you\\'ll know what you\\'ll need to do differently next time. That\\'s what makes this game so satisfying; it really makes you feel like you earn all the progress you make.\\n\\ntl;dr Game was more than I expected. 10/10 would recommend Fun game. Couldn\\'t figure out how to play with my PS4 controller so I just bought it on the PS4. I really wish I didn’t die all the time because of the wonky dodging mechanics. This game has so much potential, I love the art style, the music and the sound effects. Just the Dark Souls punish mechanic really is warranted for a game like this. I’ll still recommend it to people, if you’re looking for a challenging Platformer. wew lad I would recommend this purely for the atmosphere.\\n\\nIf you like pixel art, action platformers, or atmospheric games it is worth your time. It plays like a metroidvania-like (2D platformer with simple melee and ranged attacks where you need to unlock abilities hidden across an expansive 2D labyrinth to progress, etc ...) mixed with elements from dark souls (limited healing items that replenish on checkpoints, boss structures and themes, cryptic NPC encounters and non-linear NPC storylines, etc ...) but definitely leaning more on the metroidvania core gameplay.\\n\\nPros:\\nGame is well made with very few bugs, tight combat mechanics (a tad shallow but for the scope of the game it feels better), a mysterious but charming tradgedy story and NPCs and has some fairly difficult challenges (insane-mode). There may be an over-saturation of \"retro\" pixel graphic games but the art style and direction is very cohesive and well done.\\n\\nCons:\\nOnce you\\'ve finished a playthrough on the harder difficulty settings and found all the hidden secrets it doesn\\'t have much replayability aside from replaying it years from now for a refresher on the story (not a con per se as this is a inexpensive single player story-driven experience). Stories could be fleshed out a little more while retaining their mysterious charm and allure. Graphics could be a little more detailed even while keeping the pixel style (but this game\\'s graphics have improved since the previous rendition so it\\'s not like the devs weren\\'t trying).  \\n\\nIf you\\'re into the genre this is an easy recommendation, but even if you\\'re not the size of the content and at lower difficulty settings should still be a worthwhile purchase (especially on sale). Bonus: it supports devs who can competently scope out and finish a game, let\\'s hope to see more from them in the future. It\\'s short but worth it, took me 4-5 hours, I\\'ll probably playthrough again :) I\\'m really surprised by all the positive reviews. I bought this on release and it\\'s the only game I have ever asked for my money back on. While it looks fantastic, and the platform feels fairly tight, there are some infuriating design choices. You\\'re constantly being shot at by things off screen, and most of the projectiles pass through scenery so there are just projectiles coming from all over the place seemingly at random.\\n\\nThe difficulty curve doesn\\'t seem to be a curve at all. It starts off incredibly hard. There were other issues that I can\\'t remember. I bought this around release day and onlyplayed for about an hour.\\n\\nI generally love these kinds of games, especially when they look this good. I\\'ve played all of the popular PC Metroidvanias and loves pretty much all of them:\\n\\nOwlboy, Cave Story, Guacamelee, Spelunky, Dust: An Elysian Tale, Hollow Knight.\\n\\nGranted, expecting games to be as good as the best examples I\\'ve played is pretty unfair. Like expecting other AAA RPGs to be able to match The Witcher 2 or 3 in terms of quality, but I felt like some of the design choices in this were game breakingly frustrating. It\\'s all explorey like Metroid stuff, except alternate paths are ACTUALLY alternate paths, rather than \"wowie you don\\'t have the super missile 20xx++?? Better come back when you do!!\" and there\\'s an air dash (which gives it infinite points for me), and you can turn into a cat (which gives it infinite points for the internet, I\\'m sure), and it just feels good and looks nice so yeah I dunno it\\'s pretty cool I guess?? YEAH BOOOOOI The art is very, very cute, the music is great, the animations are all really pretty. The music is better than the game itself.\\n\\nYou can turn into a cat! Really that feature belongs in every game.\\n\\nI found the gameplay itself extremely frustrating. There are lots and lots of secrets in this game that are hidden in ways that are just obscure rather than clever, such as invisible platforms. A lot of enemies\\' attacks are telegraphed very poorly. Most of the items that are most useful for getting through boss fights are only available if you beat one of the previous bosses without taking any damage, which seems like pretty much precisely the opposite of the sensible way to design a difficulty curve.\\n\\nThere\\'s one boss fight that, as far as I can tell, exists purely as a vehicle for the player to stare down a giant zombie\\'s cleavage. The designers apparently thought this was a great idea because that one boss fight gets repeated a second time halfway through the way. Someone\\'s got a very specific fetish.\\n\\nThere is very, very little writing in this game and what\\'s there is meh.\\n\\nOverall, if you\\'re [b]really[/b] good at platformers (I\\'m not) or just enjoy pounding nails into your head, buy this game. It\\'s a great game... This is probably the greatest Metroidvania I\\'ve played in years. It\\'s been a while since enjoyed a game so much as I did with Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight.\\nIts mechanics are simple, and is not that easy, but is not hard to complete.\\nI would have liked it to be longer, but still love the game.\\nI really recomend this game, it has a beautiful soundtrack.\\nHope there is a Momodora V any time in the future :D Great improvement from the first two games. Mainly just bought it since I\\'m a sucker for great pixel art and platformers.\\n\\n\\n\\nA good Metroid-vania for people who want a challenge. Strongly recommend you play on the hardest difficulty. I loved this game,it\\'s really fun and never boring...sadly it\\'s kinda ignored...so just buy it,it worths. An absolutely astounding game in the Metroidvania style. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight has satisfyingly tight controls, an atmospheric soundtrack and great gameplay! This game is highly recommended for those looking for a relatively shorter (it took a little under 5 hours for me to complete my first playthrough on the easiest difficulty setting), challenging game. \\n\\nPersonally speaking, this game is a lot of fun for me, so much so that I wish it were longer! I\\'m hoping there will be a sequel, or even some DLC down the line! You like dark souls get it.\\n\\nYou like great pixel graphics get it.\\n\\nYou like good bosses that are fun to kill again and again get it.\\n\\nYou like good games get it. I picked up this game to pass the time while I wait for a better computer that can run Dark Souls III. What I didn\\'t expect was to have my weekend eaten up by this fantastic game! \\nI\\'m still working on beating the insane difficulty (can be very frustrating) but the feeling of satisfaction you get when you succeed in this game is wonderful.\\nEven if it is a bit short, I\\'d wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone. \\nGive it a go! :) This is an extremely well done game. Challenging while not being frustrating and all around a great experience. This game was quite fun in my opinion. It was fast paced and required some skill and mastery to proceed through the game. There was some decent but not too complicated puzzles.  I also liked how the game catered to two types of characters. Those who sort of just want to explore  and find everything: They won\\'t have to sacrifice exploration because many power-ups are hidden in the outside areas, this makes the game a bit easier and more tantalizing to journey in. To those who want the hard-fought battle experience: They can just go through boss after boss without the game feeling like it\\'s getting easier, they won\\'t get increasingly powerful but the bosses will, therefore it adds to the sense of progression skill wise. The music and sound was great. On the con side: To me there felt like there was a progression lull in the middle of the story. Your character pretty much stays the same in terms of ability for a good portion of the middle. \\nOverall I had a great time. I also reccomend that you try not to use the map for a good portion of you\\'re journey. Most of the game can be accomplished without it, and it adds to the sense of exploration instead of feeling like you are checking boxes off the map. very much like dark souls... you will die a lot depending on what difficulty you choose... Its hard to stop playing once you start... very fun and frustrating at the same time worth a purchase especially if its on sale Beautiful game waiting for the sequel This was a really great game. The environment feels likes a mix between Dark Souls and Castlevania. Beautiful music, awesome gameplay, fun bosses; This game will certainly fill the appetite of Metroidvania type 2D sidescrolling fans. Most bosses will take more than one try even for experienced players. good game wife said she approves of the christian themes found within An excellent metroidvania all around, with very few flaws. Tight controls, good combat options, fun boss fights, an amazing, fluid artstyle... If these are the sort of things important to you, you won\\'t be disappointed in this game. To me, though, the atmosphere was the truly exceptional element and the reason this game might be my favorite metroidvania. \\n\\nThe dark, morbid, beautiful atmosphere is a combination of the story, art, and sound design:\\n\\nStory: You\\'re given very little to go off of in the beginning. Your homeland has been affected by a curse, and you\\'ve come to  the capital city to seek an audience with the queen in hopes that she can aid you. The remainder of the story is conveyed by the scattered few NPCs, item descriptions, and hints from scenery, much like Dark Souls. Also, like Dark Souls, you can follow the stories of several NPCs as you progress through the game. Most bosses also have some amount of dialogue, giving them characterization and often revealing some small part of the story. \\n\\nArt: Don\\'t take my word regarding the quality - the trailer on the store page does a fine job showcasing the art and animations of the game, and also shows a diverse selection of the environments you\\'ll explore. \\n\\nSound: One thing the trailer doesn\\'t do a great job of is showcasing the way the art and sound design work together to deepen the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this is hard to demonstrate in just a few minutes, and will really only come out in full strength when you play the game yourself. The understated music is suited so well to the dark, hopeless environment.\\n\\nCombat is good. The roll and airdash both give a generous amount of invincibility frames, and most bosses have a fairly limited moveset that is almost always telegraphed to some extent, so with some focus, practice, and timing, anyone experienced in the genre could probably beat most of the bosses on normal difficulty without taking a hit. I can\\'t speak for the higher difficulties, but they\\'re always there if the normal difficulty isn\\'t challenging enough. \\n\\nThe only issue I can raise with the game is its length - it took me about 4 hours to finish my first playthrough. But, at this price, it was definitely worth it. New Game+, variable difficulty options, and a somewhat nonlinear progression should provide a solid amount of replay value as well. Highly recommended. Its a metroidvania game and its a good one worth buying.\\nGood Music\\nNice Story\\nFun Gameplay\\n Great game, loved it. Good soundtrack, well designed levels, well worth the money. At first i dint get much attention from this game but when I start playing the game in hardcore (My first try) it was soo epic, even it remind me of dark souls series because you can doge whit a forward roll. Well I got to admit I have much fun as the “cave story” game.\\nThe art and the soundtrack are made prissily for every stage of the game and the characters are well. \\nNot much to say, I like this game and if you what to now more check the review or play the game.\\n Cleary visible that this game draws a lot of inspirations from dark souls, so any dark souls player will probably like this game as well. \\n\\nGameplay is really polished, controls are well done and feels great.\\n\\nThe only annoying thing is that you need to to reach a save point after defeating a boss, or opening a shortcut or picking up an item, otherwise you lose it on death and need to start over.. Fantastic game. Hours of engaging fun. Wish there was more passive item slots to mix and match items for effectiveness (only two slots and 17 passive items). Perhaps future games will reward new game+ players with additional unlock slots to diversify repeat playthrough experience. Overall a wonderful title with a mournful environment reminescent of the dark souls games. Can\\'t see the value in replaying it other than pursuing different endings (2). Honestly one of the best games I have ever played, this game combines my favourite genre, my favourite art style, and flawless gameplay, to create an untouchable masterpiece. I personally found this game rather challenging, even on normal mode, and due to that ended up spending more time getting back to certain areas, rather than continue on (which is fine, I really didn\\'t mind). I have never played a Momodora game in my life before this, but I may just buy the rest after playing this one through. This game is probably one of the best I\\'ve played in awhile. The graphics are pretty, the animations are smooth, the characters are interesting both to look at and to talk to, the bosses are fun to fight, and there are plenty of secrets to keep you interested. great visuals, but like many games in the wake of dark souls, would\\'ve been a better game if it tried to be its own thing. combat is well animated, but a chore and the story feels unfinished\\n\\nplay momodora III instead, it gud\\n Warning : this review is perhaps too long-winded (I like to go into details). I will include a tl;dr at the end.\\n\\nReverie Under the Moonlight wears its inspirations on its sleeve, and that is totally fine. Although the comparison only goes so far, as the game has to stand on its own, what it drew from Souls game design, it drew right.\\n\\n[list]\\n[*][h1]The strongest point : atmosphere and story :[/h1]\\n\\nThis is where the game shines the most for me, and this is where its inspiration is most faithful. The game\\'s story is dark and permeated with an air of melancholy, sadness, and loss. While the soundtrack is almost silent in places, it\\'s brilliantly evocative and effective in others. \\nCharacters you meet will move from place to place after you have talked to them, and some will  have new dialogue after you have progressed far enough. \\nThe narrative is threaded throughout the environment, and found in tidbits in the dialogues and item descriptions. There isn\\'t that much to piece together, and certainly not as great a deal of ambiguity and speculation going on, but that is fine. The story is simple, but it works.\\nAll the pieces (music, art style, level design, story, characters, pacing) come together perfectly and create a great experience that stayed with me.\\n\\nHere is my only story complaint : the final boss. To try and make my point, I\\'ll draw a comparison to Dark Souls (pls forgive me). \\n\\n[spoiler]The final boss\\' character should have been more built up. Fighting Gwyn in Dark Souls was an especially effective moment because of the contrast between the build-up and the actual fight. Countless elements within the story led the player to expect an epic duel against a glorious, grand king, only to find a tired old man who is afraid of change and needs to be put out of his misery, with a somber piano piece further destroying the glory of the moment. The queen should have been more fleshed out, and her influence more apparent, with strong reminders that she is the cause of the curse. Fighting a character that we learned and care about one way or another will always make for a stronger moment.[/spoiler]\\n\\n[*][h1]Bosses (some light spoilers)[/h1]\\n\\nMy only other real criticism of the game lies in the boss design :  most of them have overly simplistic movesets. Derelict Frida is especially guilty of this, having only 4 moves, one of which is rare and very telegraphed, with the three others being too delayed to be much of a threat. \\nMost of the bosses needed, and probably deserved,  larger, more varied movesets. Fume knight, [spoiler]Artorias[/spoiler] and Manus are some of the Souls series\\' best bosses due in large part to their wide arrays of attacks that demand players learn them and react to them quickly and accurately. Pardoner Fennel, even though she is my favorite, is unfortunately very predictable. \\n\\nDespite that con, the boss roster IS solid and did not disappoint me. They are memorable and reasonably challenging. Despite her predictability, Pardoner Fennel is, for me, the highlight of the game, thanks to a beautiful and effective piano track synched perfectly with a dramatic opening monologue.\\n\\n[*][h1]Visuals[/h1]\\n\\nEverything is pleasant to look at and vibrant. The pixel art is lovely, with deceptively cute character designs. Kaho\\'s (and everyone\\'s) animations are smooth, and she is even given a few endearing idle animations and reactions. \\nHowever, the game has a bit too many dark places. It isn\\'t technically a flaw of the design, or even a wrong choice artistically, but I think it could have used a little bit more sunlit places like the grove. \\n\\n[*][h1]Level Design[/h1]\\n\\nThe map is composed of tightly inter-connected areas that flow together really well and feel cohesive. Most areas have unlockable shortcuts to make navigation smoother. \\n\\nAs expected, enemies hit hard, and healing is very limited, but the challenges are never unreasonable. Level and enemy designs punish carelessness and greed while rewarding patience. The challenge could be improved by having enemies and bosses gain additional moves and attacks as the difficulty level rises. \\n\\n[*][h1]Controls and mechanics[/h1]\\nNot much to say here. Kaho\\'s controls are fluid and work very well. Enemy attacks are clearly telegraphed and always dodgeable if you pay attention.\\n[/list]\\n[h1]Conclusion/tl;dr[/h1]\\n\\nReverie is short, but sweet, and learned all the right lessons from Souls games. Overall, it\\'s great, and its atmosphere is definitely its best aspect. While I wished it could have gone on for much longer, it is better to make a great experience that is short, rather than a mediocre long one. I definitely enjoyed myself, and I\\'ll certainly remember it. \\n\\nA lot of work and love clearly went into Reverie under the Moonlight. I\\'ll be sure to check their next games. For the time I spent, this game really left a great impression with me. The gameplay is simple metroidvania, with a lot of exploring and items to eventually get. It starts of a bit slow story, and opens up into a dark, but satisfying world. The main character is great. The characters you mean have a lot of emotion to them and actually feel like they\\'re apart of this decaying world. This was the closest game to a Souls-like feeling, of trying over and over again, adapting and getting better, with an atmosphere that just fits so well. \\n\\nThis really got to me, and I hope other people check it out. If you like games that are metrovania-style with a bit of souls-like atmosphere, this game is definitely worth the 10 bucks. It\\'s a nice no nonsense action platformer/metroidvania. It has a story to give you a clear purpose but doesn\\'t bombard you with much dialogues and jumps straight into action 99% of the time.\\n\\nIt has a nice aesthetics: The color palette unifies the overall feel of the game without feeling monotone. It\\'s also heavily animated so each little cutscense feels alive.\\n\\nIt has a nice gameplay: It\\'s got melee and ranged attack, but neither overpowers other. You\\'ll smoothly alternate between them during any battles. The enemies got a countable amount of health and a perfect guard move so each battles requires you to formulate little strategies in real time. The dodge move also gives additional depth into battles without making it too complicated. Boss battles are a balance of player-sized nimble characters and humongous monsters to give it a variety.\\n\\nThe overall stage was a huge non-linear metroid-style map that is connected to each other and require you to figure out the directions by finding gate and keys. The stages are well-designed and intuitive: stage elements are consistently shared between different areas and doesn\\'t contain punishing surprise elements. Even the secrets use a consistent mechanism to hide themselves and aren\\'t impossible to find once you\\'ve got a certain item.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s a very nice and polished game. The only problem is the length: it\\'s too damn short! Rest assured tough, it\\'s really worth all the pennies even at its length. I only complained about the length after it\\'s over, meaning it could have been longer or have a deeper lore rather than having pacing problems.\\n\\nOh, also you can become a cat (!!).\\nThe devs have no idea how idea how much I love them right now for adding this feature to the game. Smooth gameplay and looks great the whole time Excellent metroidvania with better than average pixel graphics, crazy difficulty, fair lenght and, my favorite, ridiculously well done level design. \\n\\nMy first of the series, will get into the rest, hope there\\'s another Momodora game soon! Do you like Dark Souls, but 2d and with platforming that doesn\\'t make you want to tear your fingernails off with a rusty nail?  Then you\\'ll should like this game. It\\'s a polished and punishing little piece with good enemies, art and an amazing soundtrack. Definitely worth the small price tag.\\n\\nAlso, you fight the forces of evil with a leaf. If that doesn\\'t sell it I don\\'t know what will. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a non-linear action platformer. It is the fourth game in the Momodora series. It is a prequel, so it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'ve played the others. If you enjoy this game, I recommend that you do play the other Momodora games. The first two games of the series are free, and Momodora III can be bought on steam for $2.\\n\\nGameplay:\\nMomo IV has a heavy combat focus to the game. The combat system is very different from the previous games in the series. The combat consists of your leaf, bow, roll, and items. Your leaf is basically a sword. It is a melee weapon which is sort of like the basic shovel swing attack in Shovel Knight. Attacking three time in succession performs a heavy attack which feels incredibly satisfying due to the great animation, sound, and screen shake which accompany it. The bow is your ranged attack. There is a basic shot, or you can charge up a triple arrow shot. Your roll move allows you to become invincible for a short time while you dash in a direction. This is great for moving to different sides of a boss. You also have passive and active items. These are found or bought with money dropped by enemies. You have a health bar, and can heal by using bellflower items. The combat is incredibly fun and controls very well (at least on gamepad). The bosses are also the best parts of the game. Due to the games atmosphere, way of storytelling, setting, and gameplay, the game kind of like Bloodborne. For that reason, I recommend playing the on hard-mode if you’re a fan of challenge. Momo IV is also non-linear and full of secrets like Super Metroid. I loved exploring, backtracking, and discovering new things. The gameplay is fantastic and the game’s best aspect.\\n\\nStory:\\nThe game follows Kaho, a priestess from a cursed town. She has travelled to the city Karst to get aid from the queen to help her people. The game starts you just outside of Karst City, but when you arrive, you realize that city has been corrupted by evil as well. The story is conveyed through a few NPCs you meet, and lore is provided through item descriptions. The story feels like it was intentionally left kind of vague. It doesn’t feel too absent from the game, but it is not exceptional in any way. There are also two endings to the game which will determine how satisfying the conclusion is. The game does a good job at having an eerie atmosphere to it. You might be a little concerned about the anime nature of the game if you’re opposed to anime (like me), but it isn’t too anime, so don’t worry!\\n\\nOther:\\nMomo IV’s art and animation are beautiful. The game has some of my favorite video game pixel art. I was also a big fan of the soundtrack. I was pleased with the length of the game. It took me just under 8 hours to finish (I was playing on hard mode, explored the entire map, and found all the secrets). It will probably take you around 6/7 hours to complete.\\n\\nIn Summary:\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a non-linear action platformer. The game is full of secrets and places to explore, the combat is great, the graphics are amazing, the story is okay, and the soundtrack is good. The game is also anime but not to a cancerous level. 9/10 nice af Im not done with this game yet, but yo!!!!!!! \\nthis game is super cute! the main character, the npcs, god even the imps and enemies have super cute designs... \\n That Good Stuff\\n-awesome gameplay\\n-cute npc,main character,enemy and boss designs\\n-cute art\\n-cute everything....\\n\\n\\nCursed Stuff\\n-check points aren\\'t spaced out very well\\n-insta-death pits and spikes aren\\'t very easy to see \\nA very good game, for the anime style, the gameplay, and the music.\\n\\njust a too short experience ! ! !\\n\\nby the way still happy to buy it to support the producters to make more games like that. Yawn, another pointlessly short metroidvania\\n\\nThis time ripping off castlevania, how original. Pass. A beautiful metroidvania with with simple and polished gameplay.\\nThis game offers a great experience for new and experience gamers alike. This fantasy game is awesome. And for those who are boys, then youll love this one female boss XD Criminally underappreciated game. \\n\\n9.25/10 Love it Beat the game on a seperate account.\\n-Hack and slash\\n-Difficult\\n-Very detailed pixel graphics\\n-Different endings\\n-Cool features such as when you beat a boss without getting hit you get a rare item.\\n-Seemless transitions between screens, no loading time.\\n-Generally polished game feel. It feels like it was under development for a long long time.\\n-Mechanics are skill based. (Such as dodge that makes you invincible for the duration of the roll)\\n-Secrets, lots and lots of secrets.\\n(When you beat the game you get a new game+ feature and an \"impossible mode\" where you get hit once and die. Very very good.) A great Metroid-Vania-like game with a nice simplistic combat system. The controls are tight and the game has a nice difficulty to it. It is not easy, but not too hard either. It does have a difficulty option though.\\n\\nThe world is really well designed, dark and interesting. Similar to the \"Souls\" games, there are little side-plots about individual fates of some of the inhabitants of this world.\\n\\nIt has lots of cool bosses that require you to figure out their patterns without ever becoming grindy. \\nThere are also items and power ups that help make the game feel fresh and exciting throughout.\\nIt is not very long, but it has more content than I initially though it would have considering the price tag.\\n\\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game and I really hope they are working on a sequel. Please let me know if there is a Kickstarter campaign or something and I will gladly back this.\\n\\nMeanwhile I will have to check out the other games in the series. This game is really beautiful and can be challenging at times but no good game is too easy. There\\'s a lot to explore and I feel that the replay factor (if you care about things like that) is quite high as this game seems to have a lot to offer. All in all a very nice casual game to play in your free time. definitely a good game and the OST is so good.\\n \\nthe game runs smoothly and works perfectly on my PC/laptop. The game is open the player so you can access some places in the game rather quickly and the characters in the game are nice  also the boss are memorable If you enjoy Salt & Sanctuary, Wings of Vi, or any similar game, then you will enjoy this one. The controls are fluid. The characters feel well designed. The graphics are are lovely. Content and upgrades are handed out at a well set pace. Fair fights. Momodora RutM is a wonderfully charming metroidvania game with an oppressively melancholy atmosphere. Enemies hit hard and your health is low at the start, so get used to dodging like it\\'s Dark Souls, but when you get into the swing of it there are some fantastic bosses, wonderfully designed areas and a morbid but beautiful soundtrack. If you like these sorts of games in general, then this one you will almost certainly enjoy. This game may be part of the Momodora series, but coming from the other games, the atmosphere of this game and the simplicity of the controls conjoined with the story telling give it a great game that leaves you determined to see it through. Not sure what my playtime is, but it was enough to finish it with 100% map, the heart thingies and the bug thingies in my first playthrough... hope it helps you as a guide to how much time youll spend.\\n\\nI found this game to be really fun and rewarding. Playing it in hard made it feel like a \"casual\" dark souls, really fun, nice challenge, bunch of stuff hidden... that\\'s it, great game buy it! I love the aesthetic of this game.  The gameplay is smooth and fun, definitely worth the full price. Xbox one coltroler with direct imput only. Not a PC game.\\nXbox controler emulator didn\\'t solved the problem. Short and sweet, a little dark souls and a little metroidvania. Great art style and over all just a nice experience. Its over before you know it which is the only negative i can give it. I beat the game. And the game beats me harder. would smash... Love it, kinda reminds me of dark souls. \\n\\n100% must buy Very good, great challenge. Tough and a little short but well worth it. This game is a real \"game\"game for people who loves games\\n\\nIt\\'s a 2D action platformer with metroidvania elements... but what makes this game stand out, aside from the absolutely amazing artstyle, is the combat. Fun encounters. Amazing bosses. Challenging but fair.\\n\\nThis game gave me more of a Dark Souls vibe than both Salt and Sanctuary and Lords of the Fallen combined. And no! It\\'s not because this game tires to copy Dark Souls but make it 2D. It\\'s very different from Dark Souls. It\\'s because the developers know what makes a game great. And proceed to do just that. It\\'s a huge improvement from Momodora III and I\\'m interested in where this game will go in the future. I played Momodora 3 a while back. I honestly don\\'t remember exactly how it ended up in my library, I suppose I must have bought it on a whim, probably while it was on sale. I liked it a lot, but was left wanting more. Luckily, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight was there to accommodate that.\\nRUtM was the first Metroidvania I ever played, and it blew my mind. Now that I\\'ve played more Metroidvanias, I wouldn\\'t call it the best of the genre, but it\\'s definitely up there, and while it\\'s probably nostalgia talking, it\\'s likely my second favorite Metroidvania behind the golden child that is Hollow Knight, and easily among my favorite games. When I first played it, the exploration, combat, and story were second to nothing I\\'d seen at the time, and it still very much holds up now. If I had to critique anything, it would be that certain late game upgrades make combat trivial, and some of the bosses didn\\'t get nearly as much attention as others; the Pardoner is one of my favorite bosses in any game, but none of the others really make that list. Sometimes I wish the Pardoner had been the final boss because her fight is so much more exciting than the actual villain\\'s. I also kinda preferred Momo 2\\'s take on ranged attacks, but that\\'s probably exclusive to me.\\nAnyway, I\\'m writing this because Momodora RUtM is a great game in a great series, and with Momo 5 coming someday soon, I felt like I should finally review it properly since it was and still is very important to me. Here\\'s hoping we can finally bring an end to all that human sacrifice nonsense the Priestesses keep doing. this game is mega short but everything else about it is so good that i dont even care Lovely, lovely little game.\\n\\nAfter Momodora III being short and not all that amazing I was expecting similar from RUtM - and boy was I mistaken, this is a Metroidvania platformer. It does the two most important parts of that genre correctly - it\\'s fun to move around and get places even if you\\'ve been there before, and the world is so lovely (thanks to the sweet music and the beautiful pixel art)I had a blast running around and exploring it.\\n\\nPlaying it on Hard made the game feel adequately challenging, you have to focus whenever enemies are around. Each room and enemy was designed well and fairly quickly you learn how to fight each enemy and progress through each room - another element of Metroidvania games it handles well, in that handling each room is sort of like a puzzle. Once you figure out how to move through the room dispatching the necessary enemies, moving through it again and again is easy. The meat of the difficulty comes from boss battles being very punishing thanks to your low health - it\\'s classic gameplay, you die to a boss learning its attacks and then you have to focus on being exactly where you need to be, iterating on your previous performance until you get it right. Each boss was fun, some better than others but I never found any of them lacking.\\n\\nThe game\\'s story, or plot, or narrative, or whatever word you want, is used sparingly. You know what\\'s happening through small amounts of character dialogue and moving around the world, and it tells you everything you need to know with as few elements as possible.\\nI love that style of, I guess I could call it \\'minimalist narrative\\', and Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is definitely a good example of it. A unique yet familiar art style and gameplay. It\\'s a great game.   The music is great, the gameplay is fun, the combat is fun... and never forget the atmosphere.  It is fucking beautiful. A lot of the game is simplistic, leaving little room for failiure in delivery.  \\n\\nI\\'d recommend the game greatly. Great music, great animation, great mchanics. I\\'ve only finished my first playthrough and I can\\'t wait to start again. This is a simple game that is easy to sit down and enjoy with little stress or frustration. I\\'d say get this is you want a small, but managble, challange. The cats are an added bonus. So many great things about the game, other reviewers already pointed out. Personally I like that its short I run into one boss after the other and I am loving it. Thanks for the great game and thanks for not wasting my time. An enjoyable but short \\'vania romp. I played on Hard, which pretty much forces you to master boss reads, as many attacks will one-shot or very nearly kill you. That being said, this is a good thing in the long-run, as beating bosses without taking damage gets you a special challenge reward you can\\'t acquire elsewhere (with the exception of fire arrows which can be purchased). Placement of the shrines you can warp to isn\\'t made clear, but you can warp from any shrine.\\n\\nAll in all, good value if this is your thing. Can be enjoyed in an afternoon for the price of a good lunch. This game is the best kind of brutal.  If you\\'re a fan of games like Mega Man or Dark Souls then Momodora: RUM is going to be a great fit for you.   \\n  \\nHard, fair, and fun. I speedrun this game and it is insanely fun This game is a very interesting one,as I thougt it would keep the same style of Momodora 3.When I saw the first trailer,I couldn´t believe.It was magnificent.The graphics were polished and I wasn\\'t able to find any major bug in the game.The story is involving and the way that it is presented and explainded has been made in a great way. The only place where it is lacking is in length but the quality of the product makes it more of a nitpick than anything else. 9/10. Pros:\\n\\n- Art style is beautiful.\\n- Animation is very fluid.\\n- Controls are very well done.\\n- Simple to follow for newcomers to the genre.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Too simple for veterans of Metroidvanias.\\n- Bosses offer no challenge.\\n- Story is just not interesting.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great Metroidvania, especially to those new to the genre. Even veterans of the genre will find something to like about this game.\\n\\nFull review:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_g4TLCMwxY One of my favorite Twitch streamers started playing this game and I was immediately sold!\\n\\nThe mechanics of this game are so well implemented.\\n\\nI can\\'t wait to see what these developers come up with next!! This game is as if you took darksouls and made it 2D. I\\'ve played the other momodora\\'s such as one and two and I can say this game really takes the cake when it comes to combat. The moment system feels good and each battle makes you want to perform better than before. The story is kinda there but not to strong. Talking to npc\\'s is really the only way to the story making it kinda weak. Even so this doesn\\'t mean that the story is bad I quite like it and what it\\'s build up lead to. If you\\'re looking for a fun game with that edge of difficulty than I\\'d strongly recommend you play this game. A really gorgeous Metroidlike with some pretty fun boss fights, responsive platforming, and punchy combat. I really hope to see another Momodora game someday! A short but sweet Castlevania-like game that doesn\\'t disappoint. A very fun metroidvania, good gameplay, story a bit confusing but I\\'ve personally played it for the gameplay , I liked some bosses and hated others, all in all a good experience , took me around 8 Hours to finish on hard so it\\'s a bit short if you ask me , the fast travel is a bit confusing and the shops should show up on the map but these are minor issues Holy crap I haven\\'t had this much fun playing a game in a while. Everything just feels perfect. The movement, the controls, the combat. I know exactly what I\\'m doing when I wake up! I really wanted this game and it was exactly what I dreamed it would be-dark souls metroidvainia goodness I bought this game during a sale but if I had to, I would gladly pay the full price again.\\n\\nThe game mechanics are relatively simple and easy to get used to and the combat has a certain flow to it that reminds me of Bloodborne and the more recent ICEY.\\nThe game is certainly very pixelated but there are so many details, both in the environment and in the animations, that the world just seems alive.\\nThe atmosphere of the game is just superb. When you get to darker areas later on, there is a certain feeling to it that\\'s hard to describe. Maybe unease would be the best word.\\nThe few bits of dialogue you get are clearly written with thought and seem to have some sort of deeper meaning behind them and had me actually care about the quest the heroine was on.\\n\\nThe only drawback of this game, at least in my opinon, is that it is relatively short. It\\'s slightly longer than ICEY, for example, but the tension makes it seem a bit longer. It took me about 3 hours to finish my first playthrough, but finishing the game made me want to explore the world even more.\\n\\nOverall, I can only strongly recommend this game, especially to people who like a darker atmosphere and well-made platforming action with great combat. I\\'ll gladly buy the next Momodora game and look into the other games the developers made.\\n\\nTL;DR: Buy it, it\\'s good. Beautiful visuals, excellent controls and satisfying combat mechanics make this game totally worth the price. Never played metroid or castlevania so can\\'t compare. Playing with an XBox controller, plays perfectly. Game is fun, can play small or long sessions. Got it at 30% off but honestly the full price isn\\'t exagerated I like the design, the sound, music. It\\'s a great little game to have in your library if you miss NES/SNES era. Isn\\'t long, but well implemented 2D platformer with a few metroidvanIa elements.\\nIt\\'s like \"Castle in the Darkness\" with \"Dark Souls II\" style.\\n\\nWhat\\'s making this game great:\\n+ Platforming & fighting mechanics\\n+ Abilities & level design that exploits them well\\n+ Exploring & backtracking with non-linearity like in Dark Souls II\\n+ Art style, animation & rich backgrounds\\n+ Characters (including bosses) are remarkable and progress along with the plot\\n+ Items, secrets, collectables\\n\\nIf any of forementioned points are important for you, I\\'d totally recommend this game.\\n\\nWhat isn\\'t making this game better:\\n- No 16:9\\n- (IMHO) UI isn\\'t aestetically good\\n- Mob diversity per location isn\\'t too rich\\n- Too easy bosses on \"normal\" Amazing experience for the price. The 8bit soundtrack is excellent, nice atmosphere joining cute and sadness together.\\nThe game is really responsive and can be quite unforgiving at first.\\nDark Souls in 2D featuring kittings and zombies! Took me 25 hours to get all the achievements. \\nLot of secrets & treasures. Challenging bosses. Fantastic music. \\nNice combat. Awesome art. Game is kinda short but has replayability. \\nDark Souls inspired, with dodge mechanics & items filling up at Shrines. \\nLast 3 achievements will have you master this game where you can speedrun it.\\n\\n\\nOverall, this a really great game for $10.\\nIf you still think that\\'s to much pick it up on sale. If you are looking for something like Castlevania, don\\'t stop here. This is not the game you are looking for. It is also poorly checkpointed, and the storyline isn\\'t satisfying. This is a solid metroidvania that doesn\\'t mess around when it comes to combat difficulty.  You\\'ll be dying right from the start unless you focus and get your attacks right.  The platforming tends to be easier, but is more punishing of mistakes with insta-kill spike pits.  That said the controls are very tight and responsive, so veteran platformers should have no problems.\\n\\nThe game is very short, I completed my first run in only 5 hours after having collected nearly every secret in the game, but well worth the modest price tag.  It also has a new game+ feature which might just give you another 5 hours of fun.  Overall I\\'d certainly recommend this one if you have some free time on a weekend. A very solid platformer with fair difficulty.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\nFair challenge with good checkpoints.  (I did Normal)\\nSimplistic platforming and tight controls (Used 360 Pad)\\nNice music and sound effects\\nGood Bosses, also a fair challenge.\\nGives freedom to explore to find Health pick ups, etc.\\nDialogue exchanges are nice and short, so you go back to playing quickly.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nA wee bit short, would have loved one more area.\\nBacktracking is present for most of the game. \\n(Although it is appealing to use your new found ability to go where you couldn\\'t before.)\\n Has well made characters, nice artwork as well as backgrounds, and responsive controls.\\nCan be difficult, but it is fair. In general, a very good game and is now certainly one of my favorite platformers.\\n Spikes Great Game! The game play was smooth, the pixel graphics great and the difficulty was just right. Great game, I\\'ve played it both on Steam and PS4.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Fun platforming\\n- Simple but rewarding combat\\n- Exploring feels rewarding (you always end up finding something, you don\\'t feel like going in circles for hours).\\n- Great bosses.\\n- Immersive and addicting.\\n\\nCon:\\n- A couple of bigger enemies don\\'t feel really fair because of a weird hit detection. Takes me back to my Castlevania days, worth the play if you are into games like that with a little more story involved. . I don\\'t have much to say about this game, other than simply stating the fact that this game has reached the spot of my #2 favourite game of all time.\\nI love the artstyle, the animation is lovely, scenery is beautiful, soundtrack is breathtaking. \\nThis game is simply perfection\\n10/10 i loved it so much i just wish it was longer I reccomend this game to anyone who looks for a game that can challenge your reflexes as well as your mind. I just finsihed playing this and already plan on 100% completing it. Great emphasis on exploration, boss battles are tricky, but not hard enough to be near impossible, the brawling mechanics are fun to use as well. The only problem I have is the lack of save points around important events. But try this game out for yourself. An absolutely excellent Metroidvania action game, this is a true masterpiece. The world is well-designed and intriguing, the characters are charming, the artstyle is adorable, and the action feels great. This game really turned up the polish in comparison to Momodora III, and it shows. Attacks feel impactful, dodges feel satisfying, bosses are a joy to fight, and the whole game oozes style. Absolutely pick this game up, and do yourself a favor and play it multiple times to find more of the secrets and get all the endings. It\\'s short enough that doing so shouldn\\'t be much of a hassle. If you like platforms, dark souls, and cats this game fills all your needs This installment in the Momodora series is easily the most polished and most fun of them all. The controls, when used with a controller, work very well and never cause any problems. The game can be satistfyingly difficult but never unfair. One of the game\\'s strongest points is how artistic it is. Not only are the pixel graphics amazingly animated and beautifully executed, the color palette of Kaho matches with every area, and the use of color to enhance the environments makes it all the more nice to look at. The music in the game works wonders, too; there are some pretty pieces, and they contribute well to the atmosphere. Reverie Under the Moonlight is just my kind of game, and is one of my favorites I\\'ve played recently, both in terms of gameplay and art design. I really enjoyed this game! I bought it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. One of my favorite platformers for sure. Short, but very fun. Combines a Metroidvania style map with some small elements seemingly borrowed from Dark Souls (your healing item is basically an Estus Flask). I really like the juxtiposition of the cute art style with the dark atmosphere. Castlevania meets Dark Souls. Absolutely superb platformer which offers great art, great ambience, and satisfying mechanics. Very nice level of challenge to boot.\\n\\nAlso, boobs and cats. While I really loved the time I had with the game, I am not entirely sure it\\'s worth the money.\\n\\nIf you play on normal, you will likely only spend about two hours to finish the game. \\n\\nHowever, the little content there is, is superb. The map layout is quite clever (you can kill the four main bosses after the first real boss in any order you choose), there are loads of small secrets that are genuinely worth finding, the controls are tight, items feel distinct, the music and graphics are beautiful.\\n\\nAs a bonus, there\\'s two more difficulties that have additional enemy and item placements, so I can get over the shortness of the game. \\n\\nOverall, I think if the only complaint I have about a game is \"I wish there was more of it\", it has to be a pretty good game. This game is absolutely gorgeous, with a very enticing, gloomy and dark ambiance.\\n\\nThe visuals are stunning, the controls, fluid and the music, awesome. It`s a 2D side scroller, with simple controls that are easy to pick up. However, this doesn\\'t mean the game is easy. \\n\\nThis games`s hard mode is UNFORGIVING. If you want a challenge, get this game and play it on hard mode. Definitely worth even more than it\\'s price tag. A great mix between metroid and dark souls, which happen to be two of my favorite kind of games.\\nPros\\n- Great visual/animation and sound design overall, some of the music is worth purchasing this game alone.\\n- Gameplay - Mind you I\\'ve only played the \\'Hard\\' diffuculty as I prefer a challenge, but the gameplay on hard is actually nothing like it would seem; your main weapon IS a leaf after all, how good could it be? It\\'s amazingly fun.\\n- Exploration is almost as rewarding as the first legend of zelda game. Once you get to the main area, you can go practically anywhere you feel like it, and you can go to the hardest of areas first if you desire so, and there\\'s always a nice item once you clear an area.\\nCons\\n- Storytelling is there... but it\\'s kind of poorly done. I still honestly have a shoddy idea what the story about, but I get the gist.[spoiler] The character you play is is some kind of priest who came from her village to stop a curse from spreading, and the one causing the curse is some witch.[/spoiler] Of course there\\'s more to it than that likely told in game, but this is a little tl;dr. \\n- On hard mode, FAR too many things one-hit kill you. This made some of the game feel like a chore. Still, it was my own choice to play on hard mode, so I don\\'t 100% hold it onto the game.\\n\\nOverall, this is a wonderful game and I\\'m honestly a bit sad to see that not too many people have even heard of this. \\n9/10 buy it rn Awesome game! It\\'s been a while since i played a metroidvania game, so i\\'m having a lot of fun!\\nThe difficult in some part is annoying tho... 8.5/10\\nFor big fans of Metroid 9/10\\nFor people who don\\'t like Metroid or difficulty, don\\'t play this game.\\n\\nThis is a Metroid style game with Dark Soul\\'s difficulty, atmosphere, and boss focus. Each boss is unique and interesting. It\\'s a wonder how many they manange to fit into a 6 hour adventure ($10 at the time of this review). If I could pay $60 for a 36 hour Momodora, that would be heavenly.\\n\\nThe game carries its themes gracefully, not afraid to be heavy nor light hearted. There\\'s a boss fight where you have to hit a giantess\\' boobs, and the game is full of cat motifs. Who doesn\\'t like boobs and cats?\\n\\nFor fans of this genre, I recommend this game. If you\\'re on the fence about the Metroid genre, play Super Metroid and Metroid Prime. Then, when you have depressingly realized that Nintendo has created then abandoned one of the best genre of gaming ever, Momodora will be here with open bosom, waiting for you. Having played and enjoyed a little bit of the first Momodora game, I went into this one expecting something good. What I did not go into this expecting was something THIS good. Like, seriously. This game is great. If you\\'re a fan of exploration-based action platformers (like Cave Story), then I\\'d say that this game is an essential. Buy it. Excellent, very enjoyable, and relatively fast paced.  it is mildly difficult at times, but is possibly one of my favorite games now. An excellent action platformer, drawing heavy inspiration from Cave Story, Castlevania and Dark Souls/Bloodborne. Features beautiful pixel artwork and fluid, detailed animations. The level design is excellent and the bosses are memorable, with both offering a good challenge. I highly recommend it. This entry in the Momodora series is the biggest and most polished and a great little Metroidvania. It has some Dark Souls inspiration (dodge roll, story tone, and the way items refill at shrines) but don\\'t be scared off as it\\'s 90% a \\'vania.\\n\\nThis game has tight controls, the combat feels great, and some super charming artwork. Environment, enemies, and bosses are well designed too.\\n\\nI do think it has some small niggles though. Mainly the fast travel is overly confusing and poorly implemented. There are only a few shrines you can travel to but it\\'s not obvious why or where they are since you pick a zone from a list instead of selecting the specific shrine from the map. This makes backtracking to find secrets and shops kind of a pain, especially so since shop placement is fairly random and they don\\'t show up on the map.\\n\\nStill this is well worth anyone\\'s time and a pleasure to play. There are three difficulties and lots of secrets to help power you up if the going gets tough. Explore! I\\'ll certainly check out the earlier games now. So I decided to buy this game because it looked pretty nice and simple, and I had some money to throw away. This game is absolutely wonderful. Best use of my money in a long time and I would happily throw my money at this game a second time.\\n\\nGraphics are beautifully animated pixels, and I like pixels. I spent ten minutes just looking at the grass and stuff move and even pulled my sister over just to stare at the scenery. She had no idea what this game was, doesn\\'t care for pixels or these types of graphics at all, but was amazed by how well this looked for something made out of dots. \\n\\nGame feels dark and gloomy, which it should considering whats going on, and the music enhances the atmosphere greatly. I felt tense my first play through of the game and was probably a bit more cautious than I needed to be. \\n\\nBut the best and most important part of the game, the game-play, is the definition of fantastic. It feels great. Controls are responsive and smooth and just feels nice. Just jumping through rooms felt good to me so I didn\\'t mind backtracking through areas looking for stuff I might have missed. Smacking enemies with a leaf feels satisfying as heck and made grinding so I could buy stuff enjoyable. And players are free to explore the place how they want, there\\'s no clear path to take in this game so you have to plan where to go and figure things out yourself. And I did get lost a couple of times, but that was only because I didn\\'t know I had a map at first which is my own fault for never looking at the menu because I was planning to no-life this game in my first go. \\n\\nThis game has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews for a reason. This is probably the best Metroidvania game I\\'ll ever play, I enjoyed this game more than the games that made that tag a thing. \\n\\n Good.\\n-Tight controls, very responsive.\\n-Simple mechanics, but done well.\\n-Looks cutesy, but is actually really dark in tone.\\n-Kind of short, but high replay value in my opinion.\\n-Lots of secrets.\\n-Dificulty options. A very short and sweet Metroidvania game. Well put-together, with charming visuals and a lovely soundtrack. Definitely worth playing, if a bit short. Greatly enjoyed and replayed many times. Trying my best to 100% but boss fights are a challange! as much as this game is nice and all, its extremely short and content just seems limited or unfinished. as for the price, for 5$ more you can buy Hollow Knight which is a massive content-wise game and gameplay beyond its initial price. this game doesnt give that sense of satisfaction but enough to not get a refund. Dark Souls meets Metroidvania...\\n\\nPerfection. ...ridiculously good. Was skeptical after playing the first, but then the 2nd and 3rd game came out. Now this... albeit the difference in style, every single hit and move felt truly solid and earned with lovely sound effects and rightful difficulty at normal, reccomended to anyone who loves platformers. The game is godly and is one of the few to retain the classic 2d platformer rpg spirit in the modern gaming industry, fully reccomended. Beautiful pixel art and animations. Very atmospheric. Challenging game.\\nThe controls were pretty confusing at the beginning but when I got used to them at the end I really liked the game! This game is very good. No words can create the image of how much fun i had playing this i am amazed good job dev team. Damn good.\\nI did not know of this franchise, and didn\\'t even know this one is the 4th one.\\n\\nSo the start in the forest seemed generic to me, but as soon as that ends the game shows its true colors, and DAMN did I loved it.\\nOnly thing i dislike is that it\\'s too short for its own good, but if Momodora 5 ever becomes a thing, I am buying the hell out of it.\\n\\nIt has room for improvement, but its quality level is already up there with the best of metroidvania. If for some reason you would rather watch instead of read - https://youtu.be/PZlolrBAdsk\\n\\nI Don’t necessarily know where to start with this one. I scooped Momodora: Reverie under the moonlight on a steam sale, and when i did a little digging not only did i discover it was apart of a series, but that it also was the prequel to the original momodora. Momodora classic as demonstrated from the visuals drew a lot of inspiration from another indie game cave story with it’s ascetics, and mega man for it’s gameplay. Each iteration tweaks, and slightly improves it’s core concepts in what will later be carried over into Reverie under the moonlight. surprise surprise. Momodora 1&2 are free to download and play with the 3rd being on steam for 2 bucks if that sounds interesting to you. There not long games mind you. The developer created what i can only refer to as a trilogy of games in this style to be that classic nes arcade feel so if you got some time to kill pop one in. \\n\\nThe first thing that is clear is that visually it is quite the improvement over the previous entries. It’s not the most gorgeous pixel art, but it certainly is pleasant to the eyes. I love the design for the main character, and the npcs you can interact with. However some of the enemies you encounter are uh.. a little flat. Oh and environments. yes. So what is Momodora about? Well you play  the priestess Kaho who comes from a far away land to try and save her home of a curse that has been plaguing it. Armed with nothing but a bow, a holy leaf, and special garments with great significance later on your goal is to seek an audience with the queen of Karst to possibly save your home. And that’s roughly about it. There isn’t that much given in the way of dialogue, or cutscenes that explains in detail about this land and it’s inhabitants leaving you to fill in the blanks from implied dialogue, and item descriptions. Sound familiar? It is a lot like the soul series which is an apt description to define this games inspiration. There are good amount of parallels you can draw between the two from it’s darker ascetics to it’s uses of items, and difficulty of tasks it presents. Keep in mind that it is framed in the metroidvania genre as well using a fairly large map for you to explore and backtrack through once you have collected the proper item/ upgrade to progress with goodies to find in nooks and crannies.\\n\\nAs one would expect The core of the game play reflects this change in inspiration moving from the snappy twitch play, to a slower methodical approach to traversing your surroundings of which is reminiscent of the souls series. however i don’t think this attempt to convert dark souls into a 2d plane is the most practical. There was no egregious moment that had me snapping my controller thankfully, but there were some moments that were definitely a test of patience. So one of the things that is introduced in this game is that like dark souls you have the ability to dodge, which does come in handy a fair amount  of times, but fuck me. half the time i ended up rolling right into enemies which hurts because for some reason because the developers decided to keep enemy hit boxes that you usually find in 2d platform heavy games. Not only that, but at the beginning of the game it can be unforgiving in it’s difficulty. Within the first area the game already starts throwing poison effects at you, and you only start with 3 healing items that will at best heal one bar of your health when all 3 are consumed. The next area the game also starts doling out some hefty punches with it’s enemies if your not careful. To top it off the checkpoint/ save system shares a lot of similarities with the souls series refreshing all of your usable items when you strike or pray at the bell. However unlike dark souls when you die you don’t respawn at the last checkpoint. It’s considered an actual game over which means any items you collected, or bosses defeated before reaching a check point is lost with a death leaving you to have to start from scratch. It is never bad mind you, aside from the final stretch between the two last checkpoints, the rest are well placed. Momodora is one of those games that never ramps up in difficulty which means once you get used to all of it’s quirks it becomes a rather fun experience to deal with the games challenges.\\n\\nfind a particular area frustrating to deal with? Don’t worry about it because chances are you won’t be dealing with the same challenge presented. Momodora is not a very long game, only taking me roughy 3 hours to complete it on the medium setting which means you get to explore an abundance of mini challenges between what is most definatly the best part of the game, the bosses. Some are push overs, some are easy to cheese, while others are presented well striking a nice difficulty in overtaking the boss. then there is the pardoner Fennel which is without a shadow of a doubt the highlight of what game has to offer. It’s so well constructed. The boss is aggressive enough to keep you from cheesing it, but offers enough ways to counter it that aggressiveness transforming the fight into more of a lethally fun dance that really brings out the simplicity of the controls. Hmm maybe i should have thought to talk about it first, oh well live and let live. The equipment you start with at the beginning of the game is essentially all you get in the way of a core experience so no new weapons to tinker with. Though that is not a bad thing. As stated before it is not a long game, and the developers did a good job tailoring the experience to only using a bow that you can charge for more damage as well as a leaf with a 3 part combo, and jump attack.\\n\\n AND to completely contradict myself one second later that isn’t nessissarily true that they are the only thing in your arsenal. You do collect a random assortment of items throughout the game as well through finding them in chests or buying them off the merchant with currency that drops off of slain enemies, and come in two varieties. Actives and passives. Actives are probably my least favorite to use. These items share the same slot as your healing bells, and you can only have one selected at a time through a one way rotary like dark souls meaning you will be clumsily fumbling through items in combat. Or outside of it too like me. plus a fair amount of them are uh….. not the most effective. There are a fair bit of good items though that help make short work of bosses, but that’s not the same for passives. Oh boy are some of them broken. You can only equip two at a time as a trade off, but a lot of them are so useful especially when you mix and match that you can create some ridiculous synergies. For beginners i recommend the ring of candor, which will ring whenever you walk into a room with a secret collectable if you don’t want to use a guide. And as an added little treat try taking down bosses without taking a hit. You just might get some neat things from doing so.\\n\\nLast, but certainly not least is the soundscape. A lot of the sound effects are in that compressed retro style reminesant of the snes that does a good job conveying the sense of the game. Attacks have that satisfying heft to them that goes along with the animation, cues for attacks are fairly distinct though sometimes they can be drowned out by the soundtrack. Just all around good work…. mostly. And that soundtrack. OOOOO yes it is damn good if jarring a bit since it’s higher quality sound then the rest. It really hits that sweet spot i have for low moody/ atmospheric music with a few higher energetic songs for the boss fights. I do recommend buying the soundtrack with the game. Hats off to NotoriousKnave who created it. The entire soundtrack can be found on youtube easily so give it a listen to, and it’s only 2 dollars more to purchase. Solid platformer, just the right difficult to reward ratio 7/8 stars there are cats in this game\\nvery cute Great art, solid level design, and combat that manages to make swinging around a leaf feel weighty. I loved every second of it. Masterpiece\\n I cannot recommend this game highly enough, it\\'s one of my favourite games of all time now. Everything just exudes quality, especially stunning for a game with such a small development team. I\\'ve played it through twice now, and it\\'s one of the VERY few games I\\'d consider trying to 100%. If you like metroidvanias, then this is a must buy. If you are a Dark Souls fan (or more specifically, Bloodborne) then you won\\'t regret giving this game a try. \\n\\nSpecial limited edition DRM free box copy when? Basically a 2D Soulslike/Metroidvania. Highly recommend. One of my favorite games of all time!  I must have played it through at least 7 times already.  Beautiful artwork, captivating soundtrack, and ridiculously cool enemies.  It\\'s a ton of fun to play and I highly reccomend. My first Momodora game. This game feels like a cross between Igavania games and a Soulslike game.\\nIf either appeal to you, you\\'ll like this game. 10/10 Yeah, this is awesome. Maybe the playtime is a little bit on the short side, THERE I SAID IT.\\nBut that doesn\\'t have anything to do with production quality or gameplay.\\nYes, if the game would be a little bit longer and abit more invinciblity time also the game would\\'ve been flawless.\\nAnyway, i recommed. This is sum good shite mah doodles. If you love [strike]maple leaf wielding priestesses wearing thigh-highs that turn into cats[/strike] 2D metroidvania platformers with a selective amount of challenge, then this game is defintely for you, and will leave you to wanting more at the end! I did get this game on sale and I recommend waiting for the sale as 12$ for this game seems a bit much in my opinion especially since played all the way through you might get about 8-10 hours from this game. Anyways its a nice little game fun and fast-paced although sometimes it feels like its a little easy almost like a softcore bullet hell. Pretty good buy nonetheless and worth the time. I like it Beautiful visuals, atmospheric music, smooth gameplay, and great replay value.\\n\\nI highly recommend this game. Positive review Cute souls Beautiful game,\\nyou\\'ll find a little of dark souls and a lot of metroidvania in here. Great visuals, great audio, terrific music, fairly challenging, short length but they made good use of what was there. I actually beat it in a little over 3 hours (at one point I got up and went out) despite what my time played says. Refreshing to play one of these that isn\\'t needlessly padded out. Overall a great Metroidvania. Nice playing it on hard difficulty really brings out the best out of the game. This is such a great little metroidvania. Dark souls difficult, but not unfair. What probably stood out to me the most was the brilliant sound track, some of the songs are just amazing, particularly the forest at the beginning and the subterranean grave. The only gripe I had was the lack of any leveling system, but I still recommend it to any metroidvania/dark souls fans! This game is made with Dark Souls and Castlevania fans in mind.\\n\\nSimilarities to Dark Souls:\\n- precision combat with dodge roll i-frames\\n- enemies telegraphing their attacks\\n- similar difficulty (I recommend the hard setting which adds more enemies)\\n- satisfying boss battles\\n- cryptic story and npc encounters\\n- secret areas, illusory walls, unlockable shortcuts\\n- a bonfire (bell) that restores health, item uses and acts as a warp point\\n- dark atmosphere\\n\\nMinor complaints:\\n- it\\'s short (takes 7-10 hours)\\n- some interactions serve no real purpose\\n- you die if you go below the screen while underwater (unless you\\'re on a ladder)\\n\\nMajor compliments:\\n- beautiful sprite work\\n- no padding: every room/challenge is unique\\n- challenging but fair Very good, great art. To be real, this would be my first MetroidVania game to play since I was 7. I recommend this game to people that have never played this type of game before and would like to try something new. I am also very suprised at how very little people know of this game, its great and easy to find were your going (not at first but I play dark souls) and the soundtrack and bosses are even more unique, even if you can cheese them. I am very glad I stumbled across this game on my first time on steam, buying a few others as well. play this game, you won\\'t regret it. Would recommend.  Great sprite work and music. Awesome game with a great soundtrack. I\\'ve been going through many 2D action indie games, and I finally found one worth my time. Momodora: reverie under the moonlight is a beautifully crafted game.\\n10/10! Where has this game been hiding!? I only happened to come across it (via some labyrinthine searching for indie Metroidvanias) and it\\'s a real secret gem...\\n\\nThis is a beautifully-animated, wonderfully atmospheric game with some very satisfying exploration and platform action to be had. It\\'s fun, challenging, and has a tremendous ambiance and pacing - the magic formula for fans of games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Cave Story, Knytt...\\n\\nThe most special feature of this game for me is perhaps a little odd, but there is something very humble, graceful and unpretentious about Reverie Under the Moonlight. It\\'s full of beautiful little graphical touches, charm and (often) tricky-as-hell platforming sections, but it never, ever seems to rub these details in your face as you play. \\n\\nYou can totally speed past the game, blasting through the action, or you can stop and soak in the mood of this crumbling, pretty world - it\\'s up to you. Therein lies the real magic, for me, of a good exploration game - you really do feel like you\\'re uncovering the environment for yourself, at your own pace. By letting the details of this little dystopia simply be, the developers make you feel like you\\'re uncovering something special when you notice the swaying torches, the fluttering birds, the fading paintings, or the hundreds of other tiny visual treasures in this game. \\n\\nI should probably give a more practical summary of things I loved about this game! So:\\n\\n- Gorgeous gothic atmosphere, with endearing and quirky characters\\n- Rather creepy and oppressive at times (the first location is really misleading, tone-wise, we\\'re not in cutesy Totoro country here at all)\\n- Great sense of progress. I\\'m not a completionist, but I found myself hunting down new locations and secrets for fun - the game helps you with backtracking via a warp mechanic, powering-up your own abilities, and even finding hidden collectables\\n- Memorable music and locations - such loving attention to detail in the sound design and textures too\\n- Some very satisfying movement mechanics to enjoy (later in the game, especially fun)\\n- An ambiguous story and vague character interactions leave plenty to the imagination - in a good way, for me\\n- It all proceeds very organically and there is just enough space to get lost, if you\\'re not paying attention, without letting the areas become overlong or tedious. \\n\\nIn summary, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight feels like a wonderful crossbreed of The Count Lucanor\\'s* scope, mood and graphical ambiance, and the progressive platforming action of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I was totally absorbed by it throughout and I\\'m looking forward to searching through volumes 1-3 right now.\\n\\nIf the developers are reading this - thank you for making such an immersive game, well done, and please keep it up ;)\\n\\n-P\\n\\n*Another slightly well-hidden Steam gem, for fans of creepy pixel fairytales, and highly recommended very nice big fun This game is a delightful, shorter-length Igavania with a Dark Souls bent. Although quick to pick up and play both per session and per playthrough, the skill ceiling is high enough to satisfy speed and challenge runners, with rewards available to players who defeat bosses without taking any damage. This game is a must-have for anyone wishing for a compact action-adventure + light RPG experience while taking a quick break from their many hundreds of hours of Souls mastery.\\n\\nI\\'m torn between hoping that the sequel remains a concise, tightly-designed adventure and hoping to see the explorable map increase in size, better designed individual areas, and the addition of RPG elements like upgradable weapons, equipment, and leveling up skills.  I think that the game could use the latter, but in a way that matches the short and sweet design philosophy of the series overall. Just a few more items & upgrades to really ramp up the satisfaction of exploration and discovery via small rewards.\\n\\nAn open world level design is complemented by things like character builds, which encourage players to expand their knowledge of the game to do things like sequence break in order to obtain equipment earlier than they would otherwise. As it is now, the only reward for mastery of the game is mastering the game. I love me some Metroidvania, and this game delivers that so well. This immediately became my favorite Steam game once I picked it up. Very fluent controls and many options for different play styles makes the combat always engaging. For anyone who\\'s a fan of Castlevania, Metroid, even Dark Souls, this is a must have! A wonderful take on the Metroidvania genre. Imagine Castlevania with Darksouls mechanics sprinkled in. Excellent game. It\\'s like a SNES era action adventure that also takes a few cues from Bloodborne, most notably the style of storytelling and the methodical combat. But more than that, it\\'s unusually well crafted. From the snappy menus, to the tight gameplay, and the visually varied and thematically fleshed out locations, I can tell a lot of love went into this game. The music is great, too, which contributes to the atmosphere and sense of adventure. The game progresses in a largely linear fashion, but each level is connected to the next, and there are just enough branching paths and secrets to make me feel like I\\'m exploring rather than just pushing forward. Most levels have at least one boss battle, and they can be quite challenging, often taking several attempts to beat. But that\\'s OK, because they are a joy to behold, and never seem unfair. Overall, it\\'s a pretty challening game. A step below Bloodborne, on Normal difficulty, but still demanding of your focus and timing. If I have one complaint, it\\'s that it started to feel a bit repetitive towards the end. I felt like I repeated the same few patterns of dodge and attack over and over. Still, the tight pacing, and the curiousity to see everything the game has to offer made it easy to keep playing. Highly recommended if you like the genre, and don\\'t mind a challenge. tl;dr: Foreign mute shapeshifting girl kills more than 9 people and overthrows tyrannical monarchy with maple leaf before dying dramatically. 10/10 The graphics and atmosphere of the game are beautiful and the combat is actually fun. My only complaint is that it\\'s a little short but multiple difficulty settings and lots of hidden things you miss on the first playthrough encourage you to replay the game after you beat it. If you\\'re thinking about this game at all, just get it. You won\\'t be disappointed. The art is nice, the music helps build the mood and the gameplay is challenging without being frustrating, I played on normal.  There is a hard option for people who enjoy [strike]pain[/strike] that sort of thing.\\n\\nSolid game, worth the price. About six hours of gameplay for a single runthrough to get the true ending with no information known in advance. Speed runners or people with more platforming skill then I could beat it faster then myself I am sure. Symphony of the Night + Bloodborne + Really Cute Characters and Animation + Not Too Long = You should buy and play this game A Castlevania-esque with the estus system from the souls series, this holds up pretty well. You have limited heals wich are practically used as extra lives for whenever you screw up a roll or don\\'t evade an attack properly. This one actually makes the game easier in certain regards. Instant resets infront of the games most peaking boss fights makes for a fun but sadly easy experience. The game is cute and fun and the whole deal with all the characters who only provide dialogue, but have quests that you follow through to the end makes for a great time.\\nThumbs up. Fun to play, but short.  Beautiful artwork, story somewhat uninteresting.  Plays like a combination of 2D Dark souls and Metroidvania.  Controller reccomended.  Good replayability. Nice soundtrack, nice gameplay and I loved every boss I met. A really cool game even I didn\\'t expect to like, since I\\'m not really into this genre and this is the first I played. Loved it, hope to see more games like this My introduction to this game came about when I saw a screenshot one day of Luboo--I mean, Lubella. I love Castlevania-esque games, too, so that was an added bonus. If you easily rage quit games and never come back to them or are impatient, save your money because this game is not for you.\\n\\nIf you\\'re like me and never played a game like Dark Souls/Bloodborne before, this game will make you rage when you first get into it. You can\\'t run in leaf blazing. Even the smallest enemy early on does a fair bit of damage. You can easily lose the majority of your health by not paying attention. There are traps scattered around you may not see the first time you enter a room.\\n\\nThe bosses can be the most frustrating battles or smooth as butter depending on how you approach it. Pay attention and learn how to avoid attacks. Dodge is your friend. Once you do that, the bosses are much easier. After raging on one particular boss, I came back to them later and learned how to bypass their attacks.\\n\\nI\\'m a sucker for nice pixel graphics and Momodora is no different. The game is gorgeous. The water level was not only serene yet deadly, but it didn\\'t have any of the problems I usually have with water levels in games. The enemies are cute, but that didn\\'t stop me from smacking them around with my leaf.\\n\\nI wish the map included locations of shops, but that\\'s a minor personal nitpick and doesn\\'t affect gameplay.\\n\\nThe controls were a little awkward at first. For the first couple of hours, I kept going into a panic and hitting the wrong key. Eventually, I got used to the controls and knowing which finger to push became second nature. I don\\'t think the keyboard controls are a fault of the game. It\\'s highly likely my brain was trying to do three things at once.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I don\\'t see much replay value. After almost eight hours of taking my time to explore on Normal, I found all the Ivory Bugs, completed the map, and fought a hidden boss. Unless you want to test yourself by trying out Hard Mode, Insane Mode, or going for all the achievements, I don\\'t see too many people coming back to the game. After you play through it once and explore everything, there is nothing left to surprise you.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if I just got better the more I played the game, but the final boss was laughably easy. Their True Ending form was a complete joke. There is a certain boss I\\'m sure people who have played the game can agree is much harder than the final boss.\\n\\nFighting with a leaf is funny, but the story is nothing special. I mainly used the bow, too. With games like these, story isn\\'t too important, however. You can probably guess what will happen at the end. I didn\\'t really care about the story. The only character I cared about was the skeleton-looking man, but he kind of vanished mid-way into the game. I ran around and never saw him again.\\n\\nWhile I do love the game, I have a hard time saying whether the price is worth it. If you enjoy Castlevania, Metroid, Bloodborne, or Dark Souls, or challenging games--absolutely! Go right ahead and buy it! You\\'ll be able to tell if the game is for you within the first area, but it really picks up once you get to the city. If you\\'re not sure, wait for a discount or try it out and refund. The Good: Extremely polished for a 10 dollar game. Animation, art, music, and level design are all top notch. The world flows naturally and the difficulty is extremely fair. It\\'s much like Dark Souls in the sense that if you go in playing this like any other 2d side scroller you\\'ll die, a lot. NG+ also steps up the difficulty to provide a fresh experience, but doesn\\'t count towards rewards for beating it on Hard or above if you played on Normal or Easy your first time.\\n\\nThe Bad: A normal playthrough clocked in at 6 hours for me and this was me exploring almost the entire map as well as snagging most of the items that weren\\'t boss drops and getting the true ending. It\\'s definitely a quality over quantity game but I would have liked a little more. Ending was a little sudden and final boss felt a touch anti-climatic\\n\\nOverall: The fact the only downside was wanting more is a good thing for a game that was something I beat in 2 sittings. Definitely worth your money and has only very minor flaws. I will be eagerly looking forward to the next installment. 9/10 Fun game like the third game, sadly the developers decided to screw over gamers using PS4 controllers. It works in Momodora III but in Reverie under the moonlight it doesn\\'t even work even if you set it on controller. Please fix this silly nonsense. Really fun platformer with amazing pixelated art style and beautiful sound track. Really got me into 2D platormers. This is a solid metroidvania with great atmosphere and smooth controls. Intriguing Metroidvania title and the fourth in the Momodora-Series, whose predecessors are also recommened.\\nBut this one cleary stands out and shines, because of its much higher production value and beatiful pixel art.\\nThe game plays great. The controls are tight and the combat is super fun, especially the plenty and well designed boss fights. \\nSome jump passages and a few annoying enemy placements seem a little bit iffy, but they\\'re far from a deal breaker.\\n\\nWhere the game absolutly excels it, is its amazing atmosphere, which truly immerses you in the game.\\nEvery location is unique and is brimming with history and flair.\\nAnd even though the story isnt anything to brag about in these kind of games, it gets suprisingly deep and almost heartbreaking at some points in this one, thanks partially to a lot of memorable side characters, which are scattered around the map. There are lot of collectibles to find and a few sidequests to fulfill, besides the main-quest.\\n\\n\\nHigly recommened to fans of anime-styled action-platformer, metroidvanias, and seeker of 2D-darksoulsesque games. really really good game... worth the price even when not on sale. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a well-polished dark sole inspired platformer. There is defiantly something for everyone here. The easy mode makes the game more accessible to people who don’t want to ‘get good’ or aren’t very good at platformers. While the harder modes focus on learning the games mechanics and mastering each enemy encounter.\\n\\nThe sound design is very well done and the 16bit error inspired visuals are very charming. The game might be locked at a 4:3 aspect ratio but if you don’t buy the game because of that you’re going to  miss out on a fantastic game.\\n\\nThe game is open world and there is strategy in picking the path you choose to complete the game. There are two endings – a good and bad. \\n\\nThe keyboard controls are not fantastic. It’s annoying that the jump and accept are stuck on one key. The same thing is true for back and short attack controls. The game dose support the 360 controller which dose make the game\\'s controls feel un-clunky. It is of note that there is a key mapping option for the keyboard that allows rebinding of keys. The controller support however does not support button remapping. The provided controller layout is well thought out doesn’t hinder the game play.\\n\\nThe options menu is nothing to write home about but the following options are there:\\n-sound volume {slider}\\n-music volume {slider}\\n-screen resolution {1x,2x,3x,4x and Full Screen}\\n-graphics quality {high, medium and low}\\n-screen shake {on/off}\\n-vibration {on/off}\\n-Control type {controller/keyboard}\\n-Custom keys\\n-Language\\n-Default {resets options} \\n\\nThe developer is very friendly and activity watches the games form. If you have any technical difficulties the developer will more than likely do their best to help you. \\n\\nAll up a very fun game that was well worth the price of admission. My only regret is that the I ran out of level to discover and the game doesn’t have any DLC that adds new arears. one of the best platformer ever\\nbuy it ALREADY! The fourth game of the Momodora series expands upon the strengths of the previous entries and provides a challenging and solid experience. The addition of a roll gives the combat a patient, Dark Souls feel, and players are given a wide variety of items to swap out and equip depending on their playstyle. While the game can feel a little short for those who don\\'t feel the need to explore everywhere and collect everything, the memorable characters, gorgeous pixel art, effective atmosphere, and a bit of worldbuilding set the game apart from the other indie titles available. I\\'m definitely looking forward to the developer\\'s next project. It was very fun. Not very hard. Had good, mood-setting music and amazing hi-bit graphics. Smack them tiddies another game taking the dark souls route heals and dodging didn\\'t enjoy it that much there possibly a nice game here but I don\\'t like the progression system. I don\\'t like thats its marked as a metrovania game doesn\\'t feel like there enough there to call it that rather its a action platformer. So again not the type of game I enjoy. It\\'s no exaggeration when I say it\\'s got such a \"2D Dark Souls\" feel to it. I mean, it even does the boss health bars similarly to how DaS does \\'em! The atmosphere, again, just like DaS.\\n\\nPoint being, you love the Dark Souls franchise? You\\'ll love this gem.\\n\\n\\np.s. big witch boobie slapping is in it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Giant witch boobs. If you like 2d action, this is what you\\'re looking for. This game is fantastic, worth the full price. Beautiful characters and settings, and tight level design and polished, simple, smooth action. I really enjoyed the game, I don\\'t really play vary many 2D metroidvania style games, and even as someone who doesnt play much of the genre I really enjoyed the game. maybe I like the genre and have just been missing out, take that as you will. But the game is fun challenging and beautiful, I really liked the athmosphere of the game, the music and art are good in my opinion. If you like atmospheric games and are looking for a bit of a challenge, I would reccomend picking this one up. It\\'s very good. VERY good, but sadly it\\'s a bit short. Great game. An excellent metroidvania with some serious Dark Souls in its DNA. Oh, who am I kidding, this is basically 2D Dark Souls with anime girls. The soundtrack is pitch perfect, the gameplay is super-tight, and the art is gorgeous. While the game is short, it\\'s quite challenging, and very satisfying. Well worth picking up! While I wouldn\\'t say this game has any particular qualities that make it unique or stand out amongst the crowd, it is definitely a very well-made game that\\'s pretty dang fun front to back. The combat feels great, melee attacks have a lot of weight and ranged attacks are quick and useful quite often. The platforming is also pretty solid, though the game has much less of a focus on it, but the jump and dodge moves both feel pretty good, dodge is also well-utilized in boss fights. The level design is pretty solid, just enough checkpoints to keep the player from worrying too much about having to find saves, a pretty decently sized game world (though not particularly large), lots of side areas and secrets to explore and an in-game method of keeping exploration for secrets from feeling tedious, a nice and vibrant graphical style that has pretty good atmosphere. It\\'s just a well-rounded game on all fronts, there\\'s really not much to complain about. There\\'s even various difficulty settings, for people who like that. Don\\'t quite know if I\\'d recommend it for $10 given its brevity but it\\'s certainly worth checking out regardless. A very fun little 2D platformer that takes inspiration from games like Bloodborne and 2D classics like metroid to make short but very fun game that has a ton of atmosphere This is one of those games that changes very dramatically on a second playthrough, once you know the game mechanics better.\\nThe first playthrough played like a standard Castlevania-like exploration adventure. Close range attacks, long range attacks, double jump, dodge. Use found items and abilities to progress to new areas. You know the drill.\\nI was very delighted by the art, music, and pacing. It\\'s fantastic. It\\'s a thrill to just wander around the map. But it\\'s not just pretty aesthetics, unlike other indie games with retro aesthetics that get very bland very fast (90% of indie games on steam). Momodora has very polished game mechanics that makes combat very satisfying, and has depth that teaches itself which great storytelling sensibility, without hyperkinetically filling your screen with stats and hints like other games on this genre do (hello Valdis Story).\\nMy first playthrough took me about five hours, and a healthy dose of retries over bosses that took me awhile to figure out. Then after finishing it it took me about two more hours to quickly rush through New Game+ to find all missing collectibles.\\nSo far, great. Then I went for Hard Mode and Insane Mode.\\nAt first, it seems a bit overwhelming (going from a huge lifebar to dying from a couple of hits, or just one hit in Insane mode), but there\\'s a catch you most likely will miss on your first playthrough: you get VERY powerful equipments and items when defeating bosses without getting hit. Suddenly, equipping the right stuff at the right moment is everything, and the game\\'s mechanics get a lot deeper than the first time around. You also realize just how non-linear the world is: after an introductory area, the four next main areas at the middle of the game can be tackled literally at any order before going for the final two. And figuring out the most efficient route reduces the average 5 hours of a first playthrough (according to howlongtobeat dot com) to as little as 1 hour. This might sound like a problem, but it\\'s actually a design choice: it\\'s a game designed to reward mastering. Similar to what made game like Castlevania Symphony of the Night and the first few Mega Man X so damn replayable.\\nTo people familiar with the games that inspired this one, you\\'ll feel right at home. It\\'s a short but sweet ride that\\'ll keep you comming back for more, wishing there were more new games as fine as this one around. It feels very polished, with lots of attention to details and replay value. I hope other small studios planning to take a chance at this genre are taking notes. This game is amazing, highly recommended if you are a fan of 2D castelvania or the souls games. good Overall id say this is a good game took me about ~8 hourish to complete it, i started on the hard difficulty, only difference between difficultys i see is the amount of hp you have, hard itll take 1-2 hits to kill you insane just one. honestly the game seemed more challenging than i thought id be, also a bit shorter it was an enjoyable game it has alot of polish and is very fluid  the character does what you want it to and its very beautiful, my only  complaint is i thought id be a bit longer. \\nDifficulty 6/10\\nGameplay 9/10\\nLength 4/10 Very good Metroidvania, if you\\'re into that sort of thing. It\\'s got pretty good level design and interesting characters and bosses. Very beautiful pixel art going on, as well. According to the developer the series started as a love letter to games like Mega Man and Cave story, and boy does the love show. It feels and looks amazing, the beautiful 16 bit art style sets the mood while solid platforming  and exciting combat keeps you playing. Predetermined checkpoints and refillable consumables give Momodora a pseudo Dark Souls feel and that\\'s not a bad thing. The diversity of equipable items leads to freedom of builds that allow for multiple unique playthroughs. While short, the experience was great and left me wanting much much more. I\\'m going to crank up the difficulty and keep playing until the next one comes out. You don’t need to play the previous titles to enjoy this entry. One of the best games I\\'ve ever played. I\\'m writing this review after 7 hours of playtime. This is a good game. Great even, but it is short so decide what about 4 hours of your time is worth. I spent this long on it hunting for various things and collectables, so the game isn\\'t that long unless you really grind for some stuff.\\n\\nGood soundtrack, but suffers from using the same boss theme multiple times. The pardoners dance is great because it meshes with the area song; but some other bosses just use the same song. \\n\\nIts mostly open world, so that\\'s pretty neat, but it narrows up at the end of the game.\\n\\nCombat is good, I appreciate how easy it is to stunlock most enemies, and some bosses. very few ways to mix up combat, in some respects. For example, fire damage can be obtained at one point, and I never took it off after that. If the game designer should choose to put in more damge types in the next game, make sure they are meaningful, not just choose which does the most damage.\\n\\nOverall, worth the ~$6 I spent. I love how on the second boss you\\'re literally slapping the witch\\'s tits with a leaf. how is no one talking about this game what to heck is wrong with everyone you play a little white riding hood and you spank monsters with leaves but then things get dark and big ol vampire boobies what a hoot also i gave a girl tissue and she put blood on it and somehow it is good now\\n\\nmomodora more like give-me-more-a haha 5/5 kisses Solid game. Controls are tight, Decent replay value, Good soundtrack, Level Design and enemy placements were good, Extra Boss rewards for Flawless Victories was a nice touch.\\n\\nDownsides; New players might find the controls to be deterministic. Meaning you\\'re commited to your characters actions, not alot of canceling one animation into another.\\n\\nPersonal Grievances; Another Passive, and possibly an Active, slot unlockable somehow would\\'ve been nice for playing around and tailoring a playstyle. Say the reward for beating Insane mode. Excellent game, with great graphics, combat, and atmosphere. Only thing is that it\\'s pretty short, I ran through on normal in ~4 hours, but ai didn\\'t come close to collecting everything. It\\'s a pretty short game, but it is very polished and quite challenging, especially on the harder levels (do not choose \"Easy\" though, it is really too easy). It feels like Dark Souls in 2D.\\n\\nOverall 9/10, your weapon of choice is a maple leaf Beautiful game. I just wish they added proper wide screen support... As a \"soft\" metroidvania, I loved it! It\\'s basically Bloodborne but with more anime girls 9/10 Much better, longer, and atmospheric than Momodora 3. Short, but sweet metroidvania. I look forward to future Momodora games in this same graphic style. (IF YOUR CONTROLLER IS NOT WORKING, USE x360ce32bit!)\\n\\nI played all the previous games, and this is probably the most exciting one.\\nI hope they put out a 5th in the series and with higher graphics and more satisfying weapons and challenging enemies.\\nThe bosses are really unique, and are actually easy with arow spam lol.. would be cool to get some enemies on which arrows are worth nothing.\\n\\nLore 10/10 if you\\'re into reading\\nGameplay 10/10 fastpace\\nArt 10/10 improved by alot\\n\\nOST i personally love devil may cry OST and this is also some very good ones.\\nI don\\'t mind buying the next game for 15euros.\\nI hope to see a large world to get sprinting for some special attacks This game is really scratching my metroidvania itch. The gameplay is simplistic but deep... kinda like an inch wide but a mile deep. But haven\\'t played enough to give a validated opinion on that... that\\'s just my first impression. I\\'m really enjoying the aesthetics of the game and the art is really pulling me in. I wish the game was in 16:9 that\\'s my only gripe so far. great game  great art great difficulty if you like platformers i recummend who need castlevania : stupid shadow when you have this? ( Fking Region Blocked )\\n10/10   Note: This is my first (and possibly only) review on Steam. I generally don\\'t like writing reviews because I\\'m not much of a word smith. Plus, I usually waste way too much time proof-reading and editing. But, since one of the developers was so helpful and nice in the forums when I asked if I could run the game before I even bought it, I felt I was obliged to at least state my opinion of the game...\\n\\nIn short, like has been stated by many other reviewers, if you enjoy old-school Metroid and/or Castlevania SotN, you will probably love this game. I know I do. :)\\n Nice game , i love it! the character design was gorgeous, the animation was great and very promising. \\nI really want more similar games like this to come in the future weeb dark souls 8/8 would play again A must play if you are a fan of the Castlevania Series and to a lesser extent Dark Souls, it may be a short game but I couldn\\'t tell you anything bad about it so every minute playing it is worth what you pay.\\n\\nThere are very few games I would bother completing all the achievments for and this is one of them. To be blunt on describing this game I say it’s a Metroidvania that has a gloomy atmosphere.\\nNote: I’m not suggesting that Momodora is an exact copy of those games.\\n\\nThis review is not going be focused on talking about the quality of the game or listing the pros and cons. Instead in this review I’m going to suggest what type of people would enjoy playing this game. \\n\\nAnyways,\\n\\n[b] I would recommend this game to you if you are a… [/b]\\n\\n[u] Hardcore gamer. [/u] It is because some of the achievements are challenging (not because of luck) and also you probably enjoy doing them. There is also a hard mode option when you start your game. Another reason is that when you beat the game there is a New Game + (You start from the beginning but you have all of your items from the old game).  Finally, one thing that this game does that seems interesting to me is that the game rewards you with unique items for not being hit by bosses.\\n\\n[u] Person who enjoy atmospheric games (By its art and music). [/u] If you are skeptical of this game because of its pixel graphics, hear me out. The game has many animations to make movement and attacks feel real, the backgrounds in most areas are detailed, and despite the overall theme of the in-game world there is still a lot of color (which actually benefits the theme). The music in each areas matches the theme of that area and it also adds to the grim atmosphere of this game.   \\n\\n\\n[b] I would not recommend this game to you if you are a… [/b]\\n\\n[u] Person who play games for their story. [/u] I say this because while there is some lore in the game (a lot of it is in favor text in items), the story is quite simple. When I was playing the game I didn’t feel like I had an emotional connection to any of the characters in the game. Even if there are some gloomy moments in the game, if you don’t care about any of the characters those moments won’t have much effect on you. There one more thing I want to tell you about. It is the ending of this game. When I beat the game the ending was too short and had no build up/foreshadowing to be meaningful to me. \\n\\n[u] Causal Player. [/u] The game does have an easy mode which gives you items that makes this game a lot easier however much of the game’s fun comes from the challenge. Another reason is that even with easy mode, I don’t think that causal players would enjoy that most of the save spots are spaced far away from each other and that many of them don’t have safe path to backtrack to get to them.\\n\\n It\\'s one of those games where it\\'s short run time will leave you simply wanting more. Great game, great music, and the controls and fights are really fucking good. May be short, but it should be 5 hours depending on how quick and skillful you are at the bosses.\\nEven if you don\\'t play many platformers or metroidvania games like I do, this one is definitely worth the  price and you really won\\'t regret it. It\\'s a good little Metroidvania game.  Also, please do be aware that hard mode is actually HARD.  I\\'m talking you take two hits from anything: dead.  There\\'s an Insane mode after that, where you start with most of your equippable items, and all the stuff you found is already found, plus you keep all the money you had (not much left to buy with it, though).  I haven\\'t noticed a notable increase in difficulty in tht mode, but that could be because I\\'m far more familiar with the gameplay now, and the items from last game help out a lot, too, so I\\'ll probably be suffering later on.  \\n\\nIt\\'s not hard like in games where there\\'s a lot of \"Gotcha!\" surprises, where you just have to memorize the game to win (although there is a little of that, but only a little).  It\\'s also not hard like in Dark Souls where the controls were designed by 1000 monkeys at keyboards, and if they\\'d just fix the controls it would be easy.  The controls are actually quite good.  It\\'s a lot easier once you realize that every enemy telegraphs their next move in some way, many of those being a white circle the pulses outward (easy to miss if you\\'re not looking for it).  I guess what makes it really hard is just how quicly you die.  I\\'m used to taking more than two hits before I die.  If you don\\'t find all the health powerups, you\\'ll just die in one hit.\\n\\nGameplay feels smooth, and there are some good abilities.  It doesn\\'t tell you how to use air dodge (unlockable ability), but you just hit the Roll button while in the air, so now you know.  My complaints would be that you can\\'t put notes in the map, the game doesn\\'t pause while looking at the map, and if you let go of the map button, the map closes (it\\'s not a toggle).  Also, when using the warp, it doesn\\'t show you where these places are on the map, just gives you names, so until you memorize them, you have to warp around to see where you end up.  Also, if you\\'re using a DirectInput controller, you\\'ll need to use Joy2Key or XPadder to play with it, as it doesn\\'t support them.\\n\\nThe ending kinda sucks.  It\\'s just text and then credits roll.  It\\'s not what we\\'re playing the game for, I just expected a little more there.\\n\\nOverall I highly enjoyed it.\\n\\nEdit:  Insane mode is indeed harder as you go.  Having all the health powerups at the start made it easier then, but now I\\'m often dying to things in one hit when at full health. Awesome game. I love the art style, the atmosphere and everything about it. The game is relativley short, II finished my first play through in about 5 hours  and have played a little NG+, though some people put thsi down as a negative, I prefer short one sitting metrovaniaesque games as I tend to lose interest if they take too long.  Also should mention that there is a true ending and bad ending, just incase you are confused like I was intially when I first defeated the final boss.\\n\\nExtra points for the song titled \"pardoners dance\" That song along with the boss fight is super haunting and yet beautiful. A very fun game, the setting and art are beautiful and the story short, charming, a bit shallow but still good. A there was a lot that could be done to deepen each story point, however it was still able to deleiver in a short sweet way.\\nThe game play is pretty challenging, but as you come to gripes with the mechancis you\\'ll find yourself managing very well.\\nOver all a short game, I think it\\'s worth the pruchase. \\nCan be finished in a day, but for those collectors or ones looking for some more challenge you can squeeze a few more hours out of it. \\nOverall definately recommend. Fell in love with this game instantly, so pretty. Then quickly fell out of love with it once I started playing. \\n\\nI chose the normal difficulty, it said the setting was for peoiple that are used to side scrollers. I have beaten most of the old 2D Metroid games and the GBA castlevanias, so I figured this was my mode. But instead it was more like a hard mode. Fine whatever, I can Switch to easy mode, instead of playing stealth brag normal mode. \\n\\nSwitched to easy, and it was waaay to easy. Like, special kid in a helmet easy. Blech. Ive got about 1 hour into the game and so far I am liking it. The controls are super smooth and i\\'m sure with a bit of practice, combining dodges and arrow. Also the animations are really well done. Only thing I can say as a downside is... Normal mode felt a bit tough so I switched to easy mode but easy mode felt too easy. Easy mode was too hand holdy, giving the player a rediculous amount of health right off hand with 2 passive items. I just wished the enemies would hit 1/2 as hard  but all these extra items are a bit insulting. Really liking the game so far though! In a short term, I would recommend the title, but it has some flaws as well. \\nand beware, this is no ordinary platform genre.\\n\\nThe positive aspect of the title is the art style and challenging platform design.\\naaannnd that\\'s about it. \\n\\nfrom looking at the art styles and cats, it reminded me of Shantae and Castlevania. \\nbut nope. just nope nope nope. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is way darker than what I expected, and this is where the downside of the title kicks in. \\n\\nThere simply isn\\'t narration nor character development. \\n\\nThere are great potentials of how both protagonists and antagonists develop stories, but the writing and\\nlack of interactions with characters fail to do so. \\nHaving more scenario would have made the title more completed. \\n\\nDue to lack of narration, the completion of the title is not as satisfying as it should be. \\n\\nIn addition to unfinished plot, soundtrack is not convincing. and lack of variation in gameplay. \\nEven though there are numbers of items, only few are used and lacking in enemy designs do not help with the matter. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I would recommend the title at a certain price, but it provides a unsatisfactory experience at the end. Great atmosphere reminiscent of Bloodborne and decent gameplay, but it\\'s too short and lacking gameplay mechanics to be a very good metroidvania and left me feeling unsatisfied, not helped by the ending. Kawaii Dark Souls with monster waifu. I kept watching gameplay of this game and for some reason I didn\\'t think I would like it.  It just looked too easy.  But I went for it and put it on hard mode...whoever I watched...they weren\\'t playing on hard mode...\\n\\nI love this game. Second game I got 100% Achievement. Such a terrific game in the deeps of the Steam. Thanks for the WEEK LONG DEAL I would never discover this game. Became Fan of the series.\\n\\nThe game is MetroidVania so (like Metroid or CastleVania ... duh!) or Dust....\\n\\nIt s a well made game in graphics you can see how the environment and the characters fits great. I dont usually play a game with female characters but man this animated graphics are just the best.\\n\\nThe story is the same cliche like any other game but what matters are the SIDEQUESTS and Item Lore just give that nice touch, in other worlds: it s not like \\n\"Why the hell I\\'m doing this?\"\\nmore like \"Why this universe is like that?\"\\nIt\\'s the DETAILS. The Details that attract you to the game.\\n\\nI don t usually play Metroidvania type games so I can t do a honest rate about the gameplay. Although I will say 2 words that I feel : Smooth and Simple.\\nThe game is short but It s fun . It made me beat 3 times just to unlock everything. All I Wish people should discover this game.\\n\\nPS: If you are going to get 100% Achievement \\n\\nYou can do in 3 runs. Technically 2 but trust me 3 runs is more fun.\\nI dont know if normal mode opens insane mode soo...\\n\\n1st Run Hard Mode: Play for fun, discover, explore get immerse in the game and try to complete as much I could\\n\\n2st Run: Time for the pesky achievements like (Pacifist or No deaths) You can try speedrun in the New Game+ or just do a speedrun in easy mode ( it s way easier!). Speedrunners beat this game in normal difficulty in 30 mins or less and have good paths you should check helps a lot\\n\\n3st Run: Insane Mode, It s like hard mode the only difference is that you pretty much dont have HP so it s like hit kill. Died a lot. I did the same path in speedrunners took 2 hours to complete  \\n Have fun Test your patience with Dark Souls: Loli Edition. 10/10 would play again. Fight enemies with a leaf 10/10 A beautiful, atmospheric, sometimes challenging and always enjoyable indie platformer that takes a big drop of Castlevania SOTN, a pinch of Dark Souls and mixes it up into something a bit magical.\\n  \\nDespite its short length, Momodora is something really really special.  The game has this really wonderful, dreamlike atmosphere due to its minimalist soundtrack and the dark fairy tale meets Studio Ghibli art style.  Mechanically, the game is sound, with solid platforming and generally enjoyable combat.  The boss battles are pretty cool, although they could do with a bit more balancing with some being too easy and some very frustrating.  But overall, for me, this just came together to be something more than the some of its parts, and i loved it.\\n\\nThe only bad thing to say about this game is that you can get through it in about 4 hours.  I want more.  I want depth.  I want different weapons and armour.  I want a bigger game world.  i want more bosses.  And i\\'d have gladly sunk another 20 hours into this if the content was there.\\n\\nthat said, I\\'d still rather buy something like this over another generic ubi-sandbox game, as I\\'ve had a much more meaningful few hours in this than i have in a number of much larger games.  If you don\\'t like these 16 bit style games, I doubt Momodora is the one to convert you, but if you do and don\\'t mind the short run time, I can\\'t see any reason not to give this my full recommendation (i did get it on sale though). Super enjoyable game. It gave me a lof nostalgia to the castlevania series such as SOTN. Only real downside to this game is I wish it was longer. Either way still totally a great game. + Beautifully creepy world to be explored, filled with secret items.\\n+ Great ambience music in most areas.\\n+ A bunch of items with different effects and a nice description that\\'s just attention to detail if nothing else.\\n+ Fun combat gameplay that rewards you for playing well against fun bosses.\\n+ Beautiful graphics and animation.\\n\\n- At no point did I have the idea of what\\'s going on with the story.\\n- I have no clue of who are these boss characters, what are they doing there, and why are they attacking.\\n- I don\\'t find the need for NPCs, they\\'re not memorable and honestly don\\'t contribute to the story or overall feel of the game.\\n- Very short, even when collecting everything.\\n\\nOverall, I\\'d call this game a must-play for any lover of Metroid-style games. Definitely has that lonely and creepy feeling. The story is definitely not a strong point, but the gameplay and exploring definitely make up for it. It also lends itself quite well to speed running or playing it with some added challenge. Even if you\\'re not familiar with the genre, I\\'d still recommend buying it because I definitely had some fun with it and can\\'t wait to replay it after completing my first playthrough. i played this to impress someone. it was good A well crafted game, gorgeous animations and visuals.\\nRecommend for fans of Souls-like games. If u love metroidvania games than u will love this too On a score out of ten, I\\'d give this game a six and I wouldn\\'t recommend it. Read after the break to find out why.\\n\\n* [b]Graphics (8.5/10):[/b]\\nI\\'m not going to cut corners here. This game is quite pretty. A lot. For a sprite based game the characters are detailed. The environments are awesome. And the effect layer over all of this is great to look at. The item sprites are less good (I\\'m looking at you Magnet Stone, aka grey pizza), but hey, thats not why I gave it an 8. \\n\\nThey fade to black on a few tranistions for far too long. The title screen was bland and other than \"press start\" didn\\'t have a whole lot going for it. Some of the background sticks out and I contemplated interacting with nothing. And some important items were left behind due to actual interactables sometimes being covered with grass.\\n\\n* [b]Story (5/10):[/b]\\nI honestly wanted a little bit more. I\\'m going to spoiler the whole next section to avoid spoilers and get straight to the nitty gritty. If you want a spoiler free review, check the conclusion of this section.\\n\\nAs an additional note, this is the first game of the series that I played, and by no means did I 100% the game, but I did get to the credits, and I\\'ll explain why this is in the conclusion as well.\\n\\n[spoiler]\\nStarting off, we have the silent protagonist. And not one that is actually silent mind you. But we just don\\'t know what she\\'s saying, and we\\'re left to guess what\\'s implied. Most of the main characters I met on the way were very Mary Sue/Stu. They had one motive. And most of them died.\\n\\nYour motive is to save your village. Thats it. You make a neat friend on the way. A knight girl. You even help her kill a mad arsonist demon. But she dies in the end. And has little to say to you other than plot device stuff.\\n\\nThe villains that I did run into had absolutely no story to themselves, although a couple of them did have a one liner or two.\\nHeroes: \"omg this place corrupt, did u kno that? ur a little girl. don\\'t die\"\\nVillains: \"u cant stop me/us.\"\\nExcuse me? Did I not just tear through hordes of monsters, and here I stand in the last level for you to tell me to \"be safe\"? Why? I mean, okay but wow.\\n\\nNo notes or literature in the whole game. Other than the sparse text boxes from the few NPCs you run into you don\\'t get a whole lot to digest.\\n\\nMost NPCs have 1 -2 coversations. Some have 3. Some, you don\\'t actually talk to. You just get a passing by text box \"why me?\" or the infamous \"make it stop\". Classic.\\n[/spoiler]\\n\\nIn conclusion, I went in wanting cool story, and got very little. If you\\'re looking for more than a reason why you\\'re doing all this, look elsewhere. If there is more story in post game, or inside different difficulties, I rather doubt it would have been enough to keep me here for that reason alone.\\n\\n* [b]Sound (7/10):[/b]\\nMost of the music was good. I rather enjoyed the music in [spoiler]The White Rose Garden Place[/spoiler]. Sound effects for the most part felt satisfying. I do wish I had a way to spam [spoiler]mewing as a cat[/spoiler]. None of the music hit me really hard to the point I would look it up later, or add it to a playlist. Ah well.\\n\\n* [b]Gameplay (6/10):[/b]\\nThis is what most people want when they play this game. When I was looking into it I didn\\'t go in blind. I\\'m no fanboy of the souls games, but I am a person who enjoys a good amount of difficulty. I\\'ll talk about difficulty first, then get into mechanics.\\n\\nMost of the bosses in this game have A LOT. OF. HP. If you do not upgrade your damage, you will be very sorry. Possibly. You fight with a leaf. And you are sometimes fighting a colassus harbinger of plague and scourge. So keep that in mind. I see a lot of people throwing around the \"Fake\" difficulty trope a good amount, but not explaining why this game has false difficulty. I\\'ll do my best to explain why this is.\\n\\nReasons this game is falsely difficult: Being poisoned can kill you. You can kill yourself with items that \"sacrifice HP\". Most bosses have 100x the health of trash mobs in the area. Beating bosses without getting hit rewards you with awesome loot, but going into this game blind, you may or may never know. Some enemy placement is quite unique, but if I can just dash by everything after a certain point, then whats the problem? There were traps that reset just to troll kill you (and honestly killed me far more times than monsters). Some monsters with \"tells\" (before they will big attack) for some reason have a lag between the tell and action. They make take a few steps and then attack, or not. All bosses have 5 different attacks or fewer. They also tossed in the mob with the ol\\' many copies but one does a different thing. Lasers. Tracking missiles. Arrows never have hit-stun even on small mobs.\\n\\nWHEW. Alright. So it didn\\'t go outside the box with any of the bosses. The final boss has [spoiler]three forms like any final boss should[/spoiler] and more or less was not very impressive. One miniboss had two attacks.\\n\\nAll in all this game has just a few sections. [spoiler]One intro level. Four content levels. A small pitstop. And the final level.[/spoiler] And the content levels were small. And the elevators unskippable (and sometimes a trap, and there is no way to get off that ride.).\\n\\nActual game play mechanics? Not bad, but nothing new. Double jump. Dodge roll. Melee. Ranged. [spoiler]Air dash/dodge with a 1 sec cooldown.[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe biggest plus? [spoiler]Playing as a cat and skipping literally everything due to 2.5x movespeed. Ducking under most projectiles. And having a very tiny hitbox. Just for the sacrifce of arrows.[/spoiler]\\n\\n*** [b]Conclusion:[/b]\\nWould I recommend this game? No. Only because it isn\\'t one I could tell a friend about. The story was severely lacking. The places to go and explore were sparse. The collectibles were just bugs. And the boss fights were just meeting par. This game doesn\\'t break any molds. It feels like a lot of buildup, but for a sad fart at the end and nothing but plain bread in the middle. is this dark soul  ? You can transform into a cat. I usually don\\'t write reviews but I feel I HAVE to for this one. \\n\\nFirst off, for the price, you have nothing to lose. This game is on sale a lot and in fact, I just picked it up for $6.99!\\n\\nAnyways. This is such a fun little platformer and the story is very interesting too. The gameplay ranges from easy all the way up to challenging as hell. With this one, I get hints of Dark Souls and Undertale. It\\'s like someone mashed the two together and made a really fun, challenging game!\\n\\nThe art style is so pretty to look at and showcases a super nice and modern pixel art. I\\'d love to see more games in this style. The soundtrack and sounds are also very atmospheric and add a lot to the game.\\n\\nI\\'d give this a 9/10, with my only con being that I wish it was a little longer, as I finished it in less than a day! However, I still have yet to play through the harder difficulties and get ALL achievements. This shit is fucking good\\n\\nits like castlevania, but more cute girl, and MORE CUTE GIRL. An excellent, under appreciated game that I can\\'t reccomend enough. This is one of those rare indie games like Freedom Planet that actually understands design and why retro games are fondly remembered as being the peak of the medium.\\n\\nThis is the fourth game in a series that started a humble and from what I can see, cave story inspired platformer and the evolution between all of these games is a treat to behold. Every mechanic and detail is polished incredibly well (though not perfect), and I can\\'t wait to see where the developers go from here. \\n\\nThe game is difficult at first, but incredibly satisfying to master as dodge rolls, air dodge rolls, projectile charging, melee attacks and consumable magic all have their indispensable uses against the dangerous beastiary of this game. I won\\'t go into the explicit details but know I can\\'t recommend this game enough.\\n\\nI completed my first play through on Hard  Mode and if you\\'re a seasoned player looking for a satisfying game, I suggest you do the same. \\n\\nBuy the game, and buy a copy for your friend.\\n\\n i\\'ve played for 40 minutes so far and spent the last 10  wacking  big anime hooters\\n\\nthat\\'s really all it takes to recommend a game, take note devs of the world the art style is amazing but you just can\\'t play this game without a controller... this game belongs on a 3DS not PC...\\ni don;t want to give this game a No, but the control and the blackbar next to the gameplay is just too annoying. This game is amazingly beautiful. I\\'m in love with everything, the style, the music, the gameplay. Totally recommended. underrated gem This is a great game. The music, atmosphere, and excellent controls bring the experience together perfectly. It\\'s a bit on the short side, and the bosses aren\\'t anything to write home about, but a lot better than some other \\'metroidvanias\\' I\\'ve played. Great mix of modern action RPG combat mechanics presented in a beautiful pixel art world. If you dig the souls-born franchise and Roguelike/Metroidvania games then you are in for a treat. If you\\'re looking for a good, fun action platformer, please look elsewhere. A fantastic, beautiful and challanging little metroidvania with some excellent backtracking. The fighting feels great and challanging, forcing you to think about each move. While you progress through the city of Karst you increase your healthbar and get new abilities, which changes the way you play significantly. \\n\\nMy only gripe is that its a bit too short. I would love to see some expansion or even a sequel. If you like metroidvanias, go get this! Momodora a fun metroidvania style game with souls-like elements, although it\\'s pretty short. My first playthrough was 5.5 hours on normal, second was 3.5 hours with 100% completion on hard. The longevity seems to come from replaying the game until you can master it. The bosses even drop bonus items if you can beat them without taking damage, and insane mode only gives you 1 health. If that sounds appealing, then I recommend this game for you. Meow :3 This game has a very specific asethetic and atmosphere to it that blend well with the gameplay and excellent soundtrack.\\n\\nFrom the in-game items to the enemy types nothing feels out of place in the setting presented to you. With the possible exception of some of the character\\'s wardrobe choices.\\n\\nThe game has smooth well-tuned controlls and well done animations and effects.\\n\\nThere are very few actual dead-ends when navigating through the Metroid-style environment looking for hidden items, bosses, and cash. Even when you do run into them, there is very little back-tracking necessary to get back on track. Very fun. Reminded me of a mix between the Megaman Zero games with Dark Souls like healing and bonfires. Yes, the game is a bit short and it\\'s easy to get lost [strike] if you don\\'t realize you can pause the game at any time and look at the map like I did\\t[/strike] but it was very fun nonethless. I\\'m not into this weeabo trash game type but as soon as I got to that big breasted boss I was hook. Sad theres no good R34 of this game or I would give it the recommend.\\nso no recommend cause no pr0n. that take nerds An excellent Metroidvania with a sprinkle of Dark Souls and a surprising amount of polish. Four hours may be a bit short for some people, but I personally feel like I got more than my money\\'s worth! A brilliant little game that\\'ll likely steal the heart of any 2d platformer fan. Believe it or not, this would be my first experience with a Metroidvania-esque game.\\n\\nSo, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a pixel adventure like you have never seen before. The world is under the curse of the now-insane Queen of Karst, the place of which we were thrown into by the narrative. The atmosphere is dark, but sometimes solemn. Everyone in the kingdom is either fleeing from the curse, slowly becoming insane, out to get your head, or all of them combined. There will be allies along the way, but most of the time, you are alone. You\\'re alone with yourself and a leaf to carry, and that leaf is your (very potent) weapon (of mass destruction) for today\\'s journey.\\n\\nAnd when you\\'re alone, you\\'ll die a lot. Guaranteed.\\n\\nIt\\'s no exaggeration to say that Momodora is in a way, difficult. Most would say that it\\'s as difficult as Dark Souls. I who have played Dark Souls before, would say otherwise, however. It was by no means, easy, but the level of difficulty in this game is by no means, Dark Souls. If I have to give my two-cents on this, I\\'d say Shantae and the Pirate\\'s Curse is harder than Momodora, but that\\'s just my experience.\\n\\nAlright, now let\\'s review its pros and cons:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+ Beautiful Pixel Art\\n+ Intriguing lore with a story to go with it\\n+ Stellar gameplay with fluid controls\\n+ Power-Ups that compliments the game\\n+ Very Fun\\n+ Lubilla\\'s Breast\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Too Short :(\\n- Needs More Content :(\\n- I can\\'t finish Insane at all :(\\n- I need to git gud :(\\n\\nIt\\'s definitely worth its full price, and it\\'s even better if it\\'s on discount. I hope someday, we all can play its sequel, or its prequels before Momodora III, because I hear this game is its 4th installment. I need more Momodora in my life :D I had fun with the game, for a while.  If you have $10 you want to spend on a game that takes less than 5 hours to get the full experience of, then go for it, but the game just has too little substance.\\n\\nWhat I liked:\\n-The art was good, as well as the animation\\n-The difficulty was well done throughout the game, it never felt too hard or too easy\\n-The gameplay was fun, and fast paced\\n\\nWhat I disliked:\\n-The story didn\\'t feel like a story made for the game, more like something that was an afterthought of the gameplay\\n-The bosses were unbalanced compared to the rest of the game, two of them were far too difficult, where as the rest of them were as easy as the rest of the normal weak enemies\\n-The game was far too short, if I hadn\\'t bought it durring the winter sale, I would have been far more upset\\n-The pacing is really off, the game starts off far too slow, then gets fast paced far too quickly, then it suddenly gets slow again midway through, only to end suddenly, right when I was finally getting into it\\n\\nAll in all I don\\'t see why this game has as good of reviews as it does, the game is fine enough, but not 97% of the reviews being positive good.\\n Beautiful game, with a good amount of challenge that can be frustrating at times. They did an excellent job on pretty much every aspect of this game, and I hope they make another in the same vein. Imagine that Bloodborne, Dark Souls, ShovelKnight, Metroid, and Castlevania all had a child, that is this game. This game is a perfect 10/10, short enough for interesting speed runs,  but long enough to keep you busy; packed full of secrets and hidden items that make this game a deleightful adventure. Every second of my 4 play throughs so far have been a pleasant experience that i havent experienced from playing a game in a long time. I may not be good at describing how good this game is, but I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a Metroid-vania adventure. supper fun quick game, love the art Awesome metroidvania game. A huge improvement over Momo3, the music and the whole exploration set is awesome. Well worth the money and the time to finish it, not to mention all the secrets to find and endings. Was expecting very little out of this game. Got it pretty cheap in a Steam sale after seeing it was a Metroidvania, and I have to say, I\\'m pleasantly surprised by the quality of this game. The bosses are all pretty challenging, and the combat is pretty good for a game this simple. The only real flaw is that there wasn\\'t enough of it. I explored pretty much everywhere in only about 5 hours of gameplay. Would have liked to acquire even more powers in order to seal off more of the world, but I can\\'t complain too much. The game was really good, especially considering how cheap it was. Highly recommended for any Metroidvania fans out there. Wow... Just wow... This game is great on all different kinds of levels. The controls are smooth and you get feedback immediately. Design of the levels properly allows you to use all of the movement options in the game. Bosses are very fun, and spaced just perfectly to allow you enough time to get excited for the next one. Music and artstyle only increase the corrupted feeling you get from exploring the world. It\\'s replayability and collectables have kept me coming back to it even after I finished it. And finally, who wouldn\\'t want to play as a kickass, leaf-wielding, priestess. This is not an absolute \"would-not-recommend\" by any means, but I didn\\'t enjoy Momodora\\'s particular mix of Metroidvania and Bloodborne very much. The mechanics that were taken from each genre didn\\'t mesh well.\\n\\nThe music is... somber. Which, given some of the creepier dungeon areas, isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. But it\\'s across the entire game, even the boss fights. It\\'s all on me for judging the book by the cover, but I was expecting something a little more intense.\\n\\nPositives? It was short and it\\'s a great candidate for speedrunning. The final most difficult area and fighting the last few bosses were pretty fun. Proportionally though, I was frustrated by more parts of the game than those that I enjoyed.\\n\\nIf it\\'s crazy cheap and you\\'re REALLY starved for a metroidvania/souls\\'em up, give it a shot, but otherwise, I can\\'t really recommend it. Great Metroidvania with a relaxing difficulty. Soundtrack is good, and the graphics have a very nice aesthetic. Only negative is it comes in a bit short at around 5 hours. An old-school castlevania-like game. A tad short, but worth every minute. The only thing that bothered me is the map, a bit confusing if not useless. Because of it, you sometimes end up wandering aimlessly, not sure of where you\\'re supposed to go next.\\n\\nDesign is great, as long as you like pixel-art.\\n\\nThe OST is really enjoyable, and contributes to giving a unique atmosphere to the game.\\n\\nTL;DR: Buy it. ┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓┗(＾0＾)┓ 8.5/10\\n\\nWhere do I even begin? This adventure was phenomenal! I played it with no context or recommendation, just picked it out at random to play with a friend. I took the game on, and he watched and navigated for some of the... obscure collectibles. We BOTH had a blast. Sure sign of a good game, when it\\'s both enjoyable to play and just watch. I\\'m not exaggerating when i say that this was one of my favorite games of 2016. It was cute, dastardly, easy to control, difficult to master, threw me for a loop VERY early. I was expecting sort of like a Shovel Knight level of difficulty (as that was what Steam recommended it to me for.) but was very quickly taught what hell I would have to endure. \\n\\nPros: \\n- Calming soundtrack for exploration\\n- Exciting soundtrack for boss fights!\\n- Beautiful animation and art style\\n- Power ups that really felt like they made a difference (extra bellflowers, poison arrows, etc.)\\n- Charming NPC\\'s that I really felt for, I just wanted to hug everyone\\n- Fair combat that would beat you down if you didn\\'t pay attention\\n- Memorable world that was difficult to get lost in (I know there\\'s a map but still)\\n- SO MANY SECRETS! (Konami Code, Ivory Bugs, Archpriestess Choir fight, and so much more!)\\n\\nCons:\\n- The NPC lives were rather ignorable, which was a little sad because some were so cool!\\n- The Final Boss was easier than the others, but whatever, my problem was that they were sort of, bland. You fight them at the end of the last dungeon with no dialouge (if there was any, I forgot about it really quick) and that\\'s just sorta it. \\n- Beating the game doesn\\'t show the world get better, it just says \"Ya did it, buddy.\" in the most drawn out way possible on a blank screen and asks if you wanna spend another 5 hours doing it again. A major imporvement here is help us, the player, feel like we saved a world, not feel like we finished exploring one. \\n- The Cat form was REALLY washed out, almost like they put it in last minute. There was no explanation either. You just get it after a boss. There was so much that could\\'ve been done with this, a whole world where you have to play as a cat, bosses, dungeons, NPC\\'s, ANYTHING that would help me feel like the cat meant anything. \\n\\nFixes: \\n- Draw out the Cat form, make me feel like it matters.\\n- Maybe some extra dungeons or story, longer game in general. \\n- Make the Final Boss feel like the Final Boss, not a glorified enemy with no context.\\n- Reward me for beating your game, it was rather disappointing that the game gave me a gold star and pat on the back for my efforts.\\n\\nConclusion, I love this game. It was fantastic and I want it to be as good as I know it can be. I look forward to any future games in the series and hope they\\'re even better than before. It\\'s like Dark Souls. What are you doing with that knife? Wait, dude, no, I\\'m not kidding, it\\'s really like Dark Souls! IT\\'S REALLY LIKE DARK SOULS DUDE! YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! its like a 2d dark souls Good thing the death scream is adorable.\\n\\'Cause you\\'re gonna hear it a lot. I\\'m an FPS/MMO player. This is the first side scroller I\\'ve bothered to finishing. Pretty enjoyable. Some of the side bosses were more difficult than the final boss. Great music and ambience. Pretty short, could be longer. Overall excellent game. This game is like cute Darksouls and makes you feel bad when you die. You\\'ll understand when it happens. Sometimes all I want to play is a simple 2D side scroller that doesn\\'t bog you down in boring puzzle solving and too much story, but is instead, like dark souls, about good combat and great gameplay and quiet discovery. That\\'s what this game is, and its amazing. Incredible animations , good 2D gameplay style , good difficulty and Divine character development , basically this game rules and I beat it in one 6 hour sitting but the replay value is pretty good. I\\'m gonna play it again and probably beat it in one sitting. again. if you like tough as hell action games with c r a z y boss battles, rolling, double-jumping and (later) mid-air dodging.....metroidvania style progression.........beautiful graphics........smooth animation....uhhh??? buy this game it\\'s well worth 10 bones and if its on sale just grab it. it\\'s a jam A solid Metroidvania with consistent design in gameplay, looks, and sound. The game does a good job of being challenging without being cheap.\\n\\nWhile upsettingly short, the piece-by-piece narrative helps carry it to its conclusion while giving it a lot of life. The items and weapons let me gear the game to my playstyle or to my needs from one moment to the next. This game 10/10 \\n\\nIt enabled me to hit a witch lady in her boobs with a leaf\\n\\nplus protagonist is pretty cute I somewhat recommend this game, if you\\'re looking for quality over quantity and don\\'t mind possibly needing to look at a guide/map.\\n\\nPros: Good combat, good controls, great bosses. Levels have good atmosphere. Levels can be beat in any order. Secrets are hidden at a level where you need to think hard but can find most without a guide.\\n\\nCons: Somewhat short (beat it in about 5 hours with more than half the secrets). It\\'s not always clear where to go since there\\'s lots of keys that open exactly one locked door necessary for the plot. I had to use a guide after getting three seals to find the entrance to the level with the fourth, because I really couldn\\'t find it. You do eventually get to warp between save points, but you can only select a handful of them so it feels half-baked and there\\'s still backtracking.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that this game is no pushover. Enemies and bosses can be hard to dodge and everything does a lot of damage. I would not recommend playing on Hard mode until you\\'ve beaten it on normal. [h1] Think Dark Souls meets Mega Man [/h1]\\n\\nI bought this on a whim because I love me some anime tiddies and I\\'ve been really getting into Mega Man Classic recently. I\\'m pleasantly surprised by what I\\'ve experienced.\\n\\nI played Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight with a SNES controller and it honestly made my experience all the more fun, I definitely recommend doing this.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+ Great art (Very similar to the tones of Bloodborne and Castlevania.)\\n+ Fantastic OST.\\n+ Engaging Combat. Especially on hard mode.\\n+ Great world design. Each area of the game links into other areas that allow for great shortcuts as well as more ways to uncover secrets.\\n+ Interesting and fun enemies. With the exception of a few; one which I shall go into detail on in the cons. The mini-boss in Karst City is very fun and really helps drive in early that rolling is great and jumping over attacks is also very much viable. Going 1 on 1 with most enemies will undeniably end in your total victory, however, the intricate level design, coupled with interesting, different enemies, creates a fun environment that tests your ability to plan your attack. N I C E.\\n+ No levelling system, lots of tasty upgrades. This makes the game more interesting, more rewarding and far more skill based than \"I\\'ll just grind until I can fucking wreck the next boss\". It certainly made beating Derelict Frida all the more satisfying for me when I figured out how best to attack him whilst dodging his attacks and then being rewarded for my efforts afterwards. This brings me to my next point.\\n+ Great boss battles. They\\'re just fun. Hella fun.\\n+ Great lore and side plot. You can really empathise with characters and their intents, and in my head I can just imagine Souls style voice acting to go along with it.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- The bow. It makes a handful of enemies and boss battles too easy. For example, [spoiler] there\\'s a Mimic in one of the areas of the game that stays perfectly still, whilst orbs form around it in a circle. You can literally stand just out of range of these orbs and proceed to turn the poor creature into a fucking dart board. Keeping in mind that this particular enemy is such a trope in game design that it\\'s difficult to get wrong at this point, [/spoiler] I\\'ll admit I was very underwhelmed.\\n- Too short.\\n\\nI genuinely don\\'t have any gripes with this game aside from those points. It\\'s pretty solid and I would definitely buy more additions to this franchise. The bow lets combat down in some aspects but I mean, to get around that, just... don\\'t use it. Easy.\\n\\nTLDR:\\n\\n8.9/10\\nIf you want a Mega Man/Metroid/Castlevania experience, this is the game to buy.\\nGimme more. This game is a secret gem. Please play it. It\\'s too beautiful, simple, well-made, and just plain enthralling not to give a try. There are so many crap side-scrolling games on Steam that seem clunky and unpolished, but this? This is golden. [I played it offline][NO SPOILER]\\n\\nMISC\\n- Played the first run on Hard, hadn\\'t been easy but not even impossible\\n- At Hard most of the enemies will kill you with two attacks, but it isn\\'t frustrating \\'cause the attacks are telegraphed\\n- First run took about 7 hours\\n- If you played Nuclear Throne...\\n\\n\\nPRO\\n- 60 fps\\n- Good pixelart\\n- Good music\\n- Good atmosphere\\n- Good enemies and bosses\\n- The Final Boss is great (mechanically speaking)\\n- After you end the first run you\\'ll unlock Insane difficulty, the truly highest difficulty\\n- The Italian Localization is perfect\\n- The girl is a redhead\\n\\n\\nCON\\n- The bow is way too much useful than the leaf (yeah you use a leaf as your main weapon)\\n[strike]- There\\'s a certain setup (I only say that\\'s related to poison) which is a bit, only a bit, op :\\\\[/strike]\\n- The poison is a bit op\\n- The game is pretty (not entirely) linear\\n- The NG+ isn\\'t that great\\n\\nFinal verdict: if you like metroidvania games, buy it! (maybe it\\'s better if it\\'s on sale) Basically imagine 2D side-scrolling version of dark souls (although its no where near as good as dark souls) \\nits well worth the $$$ for ~10 hours of gameplay (unless you wanna get the achievements) Fantastic Metroidvania x Souls. I\\'ve just finished the game and I really enjoyed it. The controls (XBox gamepad) are quite handy, although I would have liked to remap some buttons (e.g. roll on LB). Graphics are colorful and animations very cute. The soundtrack perfectly contributes to the magical mood. I\\'ve played on medium difficulty and sometimes needed several tries to defeat a boss - it felt challenging, but not frustrating. If you like Castlevania (e.g. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night) , you will certainly have fun with this one. If you have problems with screen tearing/stuttering, then you need to enable vsync in the config file - why is this not enabled per default or an \\'offical\\' option in the settings dialog? However - I strongly recommend this game and hope, that some day there might be a successor with a similar graphics style and gameplay. If you want to win you must slap some boobs with a leaf. I don\\'t know where to begin with this game.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard. Like, REALLY HARD.\\n\\nI fucking CRIED trying to play this game.\\n\\nJust don\\'t play the game on Hard. Or Insane. Because I did. And it SUCKED.\\n\\nBut good game. 10/10 Solid 3/5 experience. Probably containing the most gorgeous pixel work I have seen in an indie game of late, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is the fourth game in the series and combines elements from its predecessors to create the most majestic Momodora experience yet. Wack foes with a maple leaf and upgrade our heroine across a compact map, fighting some of the trickiest bosses in the franchise.\\n\\nMany have expressed concern over the difficulty, but as someone who plays retro games reguarly, I had no issues on the Normal setting. cute girl goes to spooky land and beats up the bads There\\'s a reason this game has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.  After finishing this game all the way through, I\\'m really happy that I picked this game up.  This game is an absolutely fantastic piece of art.\\n\\nThe mood is set pretty well, with the dreary fate of the city set unquestionably in stone.  You know the fate of these people, and you know how dreadful everything has become.  The level design is phenomenal, being memorable and made in a way that definitely hammers home the mood.  Then the art itself is absolutely amazing, with animations that flow really well!  The art is quite possibly my favourite part of the game, the second being the level design.  The combat is pretty great too, and keeps its momentum pretty well once you get the hang of it.  I played on Normal difficulty and it had a pretty nice difficulty to it, without holding your hand or walling you off.\\n\\nThere are, of course, some negatives to this game, which is unfortunate considering how much I loved it otherwise.  For one, some of the items that you get in the game seem too weak to be useful.  But hey, I guess the option is there at least.  Another one, which is incredibly unfortunate and what I\\'ve been dreading to write, is that the characters.. well, I don\\'t care for them nearly as much as I\\'d like to.  And believe me, I really, [i]really[/i] would like to.  Thinking about who they are and where their lives have taken them, there is definitely immense potential there, but it just doesn\\'t hold up well.  You meet these people and interact with them, often more than once, but you aren\\'t given enough background for these characters to really get a true feel for who they are.  It would have given so much more depth to the story, and solidified the mood that much more.  Now, don\\'t get me wrong, I felt for them here and there, but the feelings subsided much more quickly than I had hoped for.  And that\\'s a shame.\\n\\nOverall, this game was amazing and I want more.  Thankfully this game is the 4th game in the series, so it looks like I\\'ve got some more to look forward to!  I might play this game a couple more times first though, because I\\'m seriously in love with this game.  For those who are worried about starting with this one, I didn\\'t feel like I was really missing out on too much information.  I highly recommend this game. One of the best Indie Games I\\'ve ever played. The story is quite sad but I love it. The music and the ambience of the game really makes me enjoy playing it. If you are an Anime fan and like 2D Games, this is the game. \\n\\nAh, and if you\\'re new to those kind of games, I suggest starting on easy difficulty because normal was still quite hard for me.\\n\\n10/10 worth the money! Plays good.\\nSounds good.\\nLooks good.\\nThe story made me feel things.\\nWhat\\'s not to like? This game is great! The combat is satisfying, the music is wonderful, the characters are endearing, even if we don\\'t see that much of them. This is one of those games that leaves you wishing you could spend more time in its world. I just love it Little Red Riding Hood just got serious A very well done indie game that if anything is too short, around 4 hours. It borrows a couple ideas from Dark Souls and uses them well. There is really no replay value though because once you know what to do, and yea the game is pretty easy, even playing through again on hard would probably still be too easy. It also has one of the worst ending designs I have ever seen. After I beat the last boss, she gets one last blow on me that kills me and it says I failed and the world gets cast into darkness or whatever. I beat her again just to be sure I hadn\\'t done something wrong. I read that to get the good ending you have to have gotten some wind power and unlocked a weapon upgrade. No thanks. I\\'ll pass on figuring it out just to get the good ending when I can youtube it.\\n\\nGreat graphics, tight controls, great sound and music, and a lot of fun to play through once. But a really dumb ending design if you didn\\'t find a specific item to use in a specific place for a certain upgrade.\\n\\n7/10 only buy on sale because it is very short with no real replay value. Very fun Metroidvania-type game. A bit short, but god replayability if you want to complete the game 100%, do all difficulties and achievement.\\n\\nVery fun platforming with good controls. Good soundtrack and nice pixel graphics. The difficulty is just right: it can be difficult at times, but the well placed checkpoints means you never have to redo long parts of the game, so it never gets frustrating. I don\\'t leave reviews very often, but I have to do it for this day. The combat felt satisfying because of not only the fluid animation and good movement control, but the challenging boss fights. They are not braindead fights in most games; if you don\\'t learn bosses\\' patterns and have a good grasp on how to control your character, no matter how much health or damage you have, you can\\'t get pass them. It was my first time feeling sad beating a boss, because the experience of fighting it was very satisfying and the fact that I beat it means I won\\'t get to experience it again. \\n\\nI give it 10/10. I have to say, I was pleasantly suprised by this game. It has a very artistic feel to it, and while a short experience if you\\'re use to the metroidvania formula, is fun all the way through. There\\'s only a few things that left me wanting. \\n1. Common enemies. There is a pick of the lot count of enemies, however, dealing with them often boiled down to the same tactic of either shoot untill dead or stun lock combo till dead, with only one exception I can remember. I wish that some of the tougher mooks were harder to approch but with less health to compansate. \\n2. Items. You find a lot of items in the game, but I feel slightly disapointed by item veriety. There\\'s a good portion to pick from, but not many felt all that impactful. \\n3. NPC interactions. They are so few and far between with very little baring on anything that I\\'d rather they not be there, with only one exception being a character you interact with a grand total of 3 times. Perhapps less would have lent to atmosphere, or more to add to world building. What\\'s here is just a little... akward. \\nOther than those very minoristic points, I think Reverie Under the Moonlight is a great game well worth your time and money with it\\'s well made art, solid game play, quality sound track, and just plain memorable atmosphere. I look forward to supporting and playing whatever next comes out from this series. \\n\\nTLDR- iz good plox play\\n This game is very, very good; and was clearly a labor of love from the designer. It has a lot of character in everything from the animations, the controls, to the excellent music.\\n\\nOne of the most solid metroidvania titles I\\'ve played in awhile. If you like that style of game, I don\\'t know why you are reading this and not buying. Seriously, gogogo. Don\\'t worry if you\\'ve never played the other games, neither had it. It\\'s fine. :)\\n\\nIt is more difficult than most metroidvania titles, but not in a bad way at all. People will compare it to the souls games because the actions are really deliberate. Take things slow and methodically. Each enemy is a puzzle to decipher. There is always a way forward.\\n\\nI do have gripes about this game but they didn\\'t sour my experience very much if at all. When trying to do hard or insane or just perfect boss runs you have to restart a lot to learn it. The menuing can get old. This only happens if you are trying to perfect the game though, and a casual run would not run into this very much at all.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m lame and complained on the forums about said issue and the dev was totally cool and awesome about it. Dev is a pretty cool person and really reaches out to people and is super nice! :) Mad respect.\\n\\nJust don\\'t play this on insane. Is it supposed to be hard? Yes. But on insane it\\'s really only hard because of RNG. If you know how the movements and stuff are done, you should be able to do it, but RNG can screw you mid action. The design isn\\'t quite tight enough to make insane difficulty really work well, IMO. The first area is crazy on insane because of all the RNG in all the enemy movements.\\n\\nTLDR: if you like souls games, buy this. If you like metroidvania games, buy this. If you like good games, buy this. Sexy Sound Track\\nSexy Animations\\nSexy Bosses and Enemies\\nThis game is just very S E X Y A very fun and challenging ableit short 2D Action-platformer. Almost every aspect of the game is polished to an immaculate shine. The game has meaty combat, lovingly crafted art (I really like the look of the game and the characters even as someone that generally doesn\\'t like cutesy anime girls), a world that is very beautiful and a joy to immerse yourself into, and power-ups and spells to find that give enemy encounters variety and depth. The fantastic A/V design and challenging boss fights could by themselves get you \"hooked\", but on top of that you gain new abilities at just the right pace to feel like you\\'re really progressing. The character interactions, too, while limited, help give some life to the game world and grativas to your actions. While the game is quite short, it does have a New Game+ mode which is a good excuse to play it twice. The normal price for this game (10 USD) is fair in my opinion, although I just wish it was longer and more fleshed out for the sake of it. It was an adventure that I was sad to finish purely because I felt it had more potential. As it is, though, I would still [b]highly[/b] recommend the game to [b]anyone[/b] that enjoys action-platformers or good games in general. A pretty great game from start to finish. This game takes inspiration from metriodvania\\'s and souls games, it wears this on its sleeve and it works pretty well, with an original story that feels very well done. Short but great action side scroller.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Fun and quirky boss fights\\n-Swift and intricate gameplay\\n-Good soundtrack\\n-Great visuals\\n-Strong platforming\\n\\nCons/Middling Things:\\n-Somewhat short, doesn\\'t bother me but may bother some\\n-Not a lot of achievements.\\n-[spoiler] Hides its best fight behind an ending [/spoiler]\\n\\nOverall great game, highly recommended even at full price. The monster girl designs where great and so where the witch tits A great metroidvania sidescroller with combat mechanics that feel good. Its only sin was being too short. My god have I not enjoyed a good old fashion hard game in such a long time. Tight controls,satisfying gameplay,Socksmakepeoplesexy.net approved!!!! Good game, but it\\'s very short. Hardcore gamers can finish this it in a few hours. Would reccomend for casual gamers looking for a challenge. Simply one of the best metroidvania titles there is Momodora: Reverie is a breathtakingly gorgeous and smartly challenging metroidvania style game.  You play as a priestess, armed with bow and leaf, fighting your way through a sprawling overworld that twists and interconnects together.  The tone of the game is somewhere between dark souls and touhou, featuring a cast of cute characters in a dismally bleak world full of depression and death.  The story is told through brief snippets and through the environment, rather than relying on lengthy cutscenes.\\nThe game is simple, based primarily off of learning and dodging enemy attack patterns.  The heroine\\'s attacks feel weighty, and the simple combat system hides a lot of depth.  Enemy placement is smart, so an enemy that is easy to defeat at first might be harder in future rooms.  The controls are responsive and motion is fluid, so each chunk of damage or death feels like your fault, rather than the fault of the game.  The bosses are well designed and each encounter feels appropriately epic.\\nThe game is short, however, and can easily be beaten in 4-6 hours. Momodara... It\\'s a bit difficult. It\\'s tough to understand at first.\\nBut once you get it? Once you realize the challenge you\\'re up against?\\n\\nIt\\'s VERY worth it.\\nPlaying through this game twice, I\\'ve enjoyed it. I\\'ve enjoyed the challenge, of a semi-difficult game, that isn\\'t that hard once you get to know it.\\nI like this game. After looking at \"Momodora\"s Screenshots I had expected a cute Anime-Side-Scroller. So very surprised when I got stuck in it\\'s first few areas. Only after I had finally beaten the first boss entered the city I noticed what appears to be the biggest inspiration for this title: the \"Souls Series\". \\n\\nIt takes things like the bonfire- and estus-system, tragic and vague character stories you might expect from a game in the soulsborne-style and applies it to beautiful pixelart, a stellar soundtrack and a simple but satisfying combat system and  and turns into one of the most enjoyable Games I\\'ve played in a while. Although relatively a short game, Momodora is quite an amazing game. \\n\\nIt has great replaybility with it\\'s New Game + and nice difficulty curve where you slowly learn the pattern\\'s of the bosses with each attempt. I\\'d like to compare it akin to Dark Souls, although I\\'m sure there some that would beg to differ. The amount of freedom you are given is very nice as you can go into different area\\'s in any order, with some rooms being blocked off leading to the need to backtrack. \\n\\nThe sprite work is well done with smooth animations. The soundtrack is beautifully composed, with each track fitting properly with each situation and area. The character and enemy design fit very nicely within the world of the game.\\n\\nThe story is pretty simple, you go on a journey as a priestess to stop a crisis from reaching your homeland while facing many perils along the way. The endings differ depending on certain factors that I won\\'t spoil. Items have descriptions that give you lore about the world, again similar to Dark Soul, The characters a pretty interesting, however I\\'ve only delved into NG+ recently so I\\'m unsure of if different scnarios happen with different choices in dialogue.\\n\\nThe controls run smoothly and there is a controller support that is great appreiciated, but it still plays fine with keyboard and mouse. I have not run into any frame drops either so I\\'m sure this will run on most rigs since mine isn\\'t anything highend at all.\\n\\n\\nAll in all, Momodora deserve the praise it\\'s been given and if you\\'re a fan of Metroidvanias then you must add this to your Library.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(although I originally just got it cuz it\\'s similar to my steam name, but I\\'m glad I did buy it!) Beautiful and very atmospheric Metroidvania-game with an interesting mix of dereliction and cute.\\nSolid gameplay with well balanced difficulty, not easy enough so you can just breeze through it, not too hard either.\\n Wow!\\n\\nThis game was awesome.  I couldn\\'t stop playing until I beat it. Great art and animations and wonderful smooth controls.  Lots of customization in playstyle with all the different equippable items. If you love the DS/GBA Castlevania games like me you will love this game too. \\n\\nIt is a pretty short game though...but I will probably replay it a couple of times beginning to end. Mostly just can\\'t wait until another one comes out. I went back and bought all the previous games in the series. A friend bought this game for me.  There were times while I was playing that I figured he wasn\\'t actually my friend anymore and this was how he was telling me.  After I finally beat the game, he\\'s still my friend and the game was a blast to play.  The graphic style is immensely pleasing to the eye, the music was an incredible joy to listen to, and Fennel is a jerk boss (especially on Hard which is how I did my entire first playthrough).\\n\\n10/10 Would be alternately frustrated and pleased by this again.\\n its just very good It was almost chance that I ended up purchasing this game, and I am so happy that I did. This game is incredibly fun, it plays smooth, its very beautiful in all aspects (music, the nicely done pixel graphics, the animations), and its challenging. I just finished my first playthrough before writing this and I know im going to be doing a few more, I\\'ll be playing through all the other Momodoras as well. This game feels great to play, it\\'s planned well with the advantages of the linearness of a sidescroller and has a bit of darksouls feel to it. I haven\\'t looked anything up but I hope that there are more Momodoras coming because this has easily become a favorite series in my book. great soundtrack and art, gamplay is solid and game is great. Beautiful Art, Amazing Music, Good Bosses, Good Controls, Nice Story, \\n\\nHard in just the right way. Only real bad side is that it ended too quickly. Really just a wonderful game. Bought because I thought the art looked cool and then was very pleasantly surprised by how good of a game it was. Challenging but rewarding combat, great music and GREAT atmosphere. Not terribly long, took me about 4 hours to beat, but there are harder modes and collectibles and whatnot to expand you time played. Definitely recommend if you\\'re in the market for a metroidvania-style game. Sick nasty game with great atmosphere and general feeling. Whets the appetite for Metroid and has some cool features to it. Environments are pretty cool and has some cool boss fights. Minimal backtracking required and you can explore at your own pace. Great gayme would reccommend Do you like Dark Souls/Bloodborne? Then this is the game for you. Do you like metroidvania games? Then this is the game for you. Do you like games in general with a cute aesthetic and a dark setting? Like, thousand-year door kinda stuff? Then this is the game for you. It is, however, a bit short. I beat the main story and got the true ending in one session, which was about 4 hours long. However, there are secrets, collectibles, and goals to strive for. I think this game is great. Definitely a test of skill. My first experience with the [i]Momodora[/i] series was [i]Momodora III[/i], a short but sweet linear action platformer that boasted cute art, great visual and character design, and heaps of influence from the atmosphere and storytelling methods of (strangely enough) [i]Dark Souls[/i], all nicely wrapped up with a HUD much like that of [i]Cave Story[/i] and text presented in the font from [i]EarthBound[/i].  Despite all that, the gameplay lacked much complexity with no real movement options and hardly any reason to use the melee attack instead of the chargeable ranged attack, but still, it only lasted about 90 minutes, which is hardly long enough for any game to overstay its welcome, and the price tag was low to match.\\n\\nWith this experience, I didn\\'t really know what to expect from the sequel.  I certainly didn\\'t expect it to be the best game I played that came out in 2016, but here we are.  Allow me to explain.\\n\\n[i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] might as well be Super Momodora IV for how much it improves upon the previous game.  The sprites for Kaho and the enemies take up a much larger amount of the screen and are beautifully detailed.  Kaho starts with mostly the same kit as Momo and Isadora, with the addition of a dodge roll with some generous iframes and a bow bound to a different key than the melee attack.  That melee attack is slower in exchange for dealing much more damage, connecting into a multi-hit combo on the ground, and sporting a healthy amount of hitlag to make every strike feel powerful when it makes contact.  With only a few changes, the combat feels miles better than in the previous game and every strike feels weighty and deliberate.  These positive changes extend to the items as well, which are now classified into passive and active items, and this is where the already good combat truly shines (for me).  The first active item you get is a Bellflower, essentially an Estus Flask to extend the [i]Dark Souls[/i] comparison, which keeps the player less tied to the save points, especially later once they become more sparse.  But possibly more important are items which function off of the player\\'s damage and the condition that bosses will drop items if defeated without the player taking damage.  Somehow this balanced the difficulty [i]beautifully[/i] for me.  With the addition of items like the Tainted Missive (2/4 charges, takes off 25% of your HP, doubles your damage temporarily) and the Necklace of Sacrifice (doubles damage when below 25% health, stacks with previous AFAIK), bosses melt [i]fast[/i] if you don\\'t get hit, and you\\'re rewarded with powerful upgrades for doing so.  Each fight became tense and hugely rewarding when I finally managed to do it perfectly and if you\\'re up to the challenge, I would honestly recommend playing through the game this way.  But if that\\'s not your kind of thing or you prefer to have a backup plan, there are a number of healing items that cater to a more defensive strategy.\\n\\nAnd of course, the game loses none of the atmosphere or storytelling that made [i]Momodora III[/i] so interesting for what it was.  It\\'s still there in spades and it has more time to build itself up, as the game now clocks in at around 4.5 hours with no dips in quality.  It also trades in the linearity of the previous game for a Metroidvania style, apparently more like the first two games in the series.\\n\\nIf there\\'s any complaints I have about this game, it would be some occasional problems with backtracking in the early segments (it\\'s either more difficult than it should be or a complete joke) and the final boss, which is seemingly always a complete joke.  It\\'s also a little on the short side, but it\\'s got a ton of replay value and my complaints honestly feel minor for how excellent the rest of this game is.\\n\\nIn short, [i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] is everything a followup to a game like [i]Momodora III[/i] could have wanted to be and I couldn\\'t recommend it more highly.  [i]Momodora[/i] wasn\\'t huge on my radar before, but I can\\'t wait to see what the next game in the series has to offer. What Bloodborne would be like if it was a 2d anime game. I beat a witch ten times my size by slapping her boobs with a maple leaf.\\n\\n10/10 would slap again This game is a must have for metroidvania fans\\n\\nwith the main game being pretty short its not cut short at all. its pacing was perfect in my opinion and has tons of replay value especially with hard mode\\nVisually its beautiful, all the sprites are well animated and lively \\nthe soundtrack is pretty nice, not the best but good enough to make me buy it\\n\\nmost importantly, this game has personality and it does with minimun actual dialogue all the little things are done just right to make it stand out\\n\\n9.5/10 will be playing it for years \\n This game is tight! Charming and clean artstyle, consistent and snappy gameplay. Just a quick review...\\n\\n2 solid thumbs up. Very interesting story, solid controls, and engaging gameplay. Obvious dark souls simularities, which is one of the reasons I bought it.  Another great game in this vein is salt and sanctuary.  Anyway, have fun!!!\\n\\nE it\\'s like dark soul but it\\'s 2D and pixelized, and easier (unless you play it on hard or insane)\\n\\nboss fights are fun, some of them are hard and some of them are easy.\\n\\nthe armor arrowproof girl can one hit you if you don\\'t upgrade your health.\\n\\nthe boobs of decay gives you two hours to prepare before each of her attacks.\\n\\nthat trader looks like a prick too bad i can\\'t kill him.\\n\\nno idea what are the detail of the storry but don\\'t care either.\\n\\nafterall it\\'s a good game, would give it a solid 8/10. This game felt like it was done to perfection. The gameplay was challenging and fair; the characters felt good to listen to and see. The story itself was really well done, and the music and artstyle were amazing and dit really well with the story. The progression of the game actually feels like you\\'re getting stronger as you go, and the items in the game actually gave me a bit of choice in what seemed to just be a simple action platformer. The ending was amazing and is something that needs to be experienced by everyone; not just watched on YouTube and forgotten. The controls for the game (on controller and on keyboard) I felt were wonderful, and helped the game along the way. Deaths in this game were plentiful, but could\\'ve easily been avoided with the games dodging mechanic, ability to pause the game to take a moment, and the reusability of healing items when you reach a save point. All in all, the game is just amazing, and completely worth the price that its given. The four and a half hours it took me to get everything in the game was time well spent, as I couldn\\'t stop wanting to play it up until the very end to see what would happen to the protagonist.\\n\\nTl;dr: go and play this game. Its fully worth its price point, even at 4-5 hours in length. The gameplay, visuals, story and soundtrack make this game a 10/10. Great game reminds me of Symphony of Night for PS1.  Not as many items but still this is a great game.  I even like the game mode that lets you start over with all your items. I don\\'t mean to be the odd one out in opposition to overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I can\\'t recommend this game. A few minutes in, I thought it would be cool, but as I played (albeit for 14 minutes) I found this game horribly underwhelming. One of the features the game is sold in is \"combo, dodge, and skewer enemies with arrows\"- by that, it means (up until the point I played) use the same 3 hit combo, alongside the one variation (a jump attack) to slowly pummel your enemies, roll in a weak attempt to dodge, but probably roll into and get damaged by another enemy despite your efforts, and charge your arrows for what feels like half a minute to shoot and have your efforts be of any use (otherwise, you shoot one arrow that deals minimum damage). Besides that, theres the issue with painfully unpolished dialogue. Most games like this will have at least a couple different lines of dialogue for you to read or listen to when you interact with NPCs, but most in the game only have one from what I\\'ve found. There\\'s even one priestess who\\'ll ask you to donate 15 munni (which in this game is kind of a lot, considering farming feels like it takes ages and has little usefulness in the end), and will guilt trip you if you say no, but will just ask again with no change of dialogue if you say yes. Alongside that, I swear the bossfights are easier the standard enemies who\\'ll just surprise, flank, or attack you even if you dodge. After one boss fight, with full health I literally got killed by a damn floating skull. Not to mention, given the uneven and sparse placement of save points, if you die in combat (which is even easier to do than in Dark Souls) you lose everything you earned since the last save, and chances are you\\'ll end up painfully far away so that you\\'ll need to traverse the monotonous terrain again just to get back to where you were and potentially die again. Now don\\'t get me wrong, I like the art style, but if you have to stare at the same place for an extended period of time because you\\'re constantly dying for little to no reason, you get over the beauty and realize lack of inspiration and recurring patterns in the gameplay.\\nI\\'m pretty sure I\\'m missing out on some pretty cool stuff, if not interesting plot later in the game, but for once I just can\\'t bring myself to get over everything that bothers me about the game. Key thing to remember with this game is:\\nIf you don\\'t learn how to dodge-roll, you\\'re gonna have a bad time. This game surprised me. Excellent Metroidvania gameplay for enticing exploration, blus incredibly fluid pixel animations with tight gameplay. That Mario-esque momentum makes the platforming feel really smooth. There\\'s a Souls-like map design philosophy where progress is often a loop back to a bonfire (in this case bells) that will restore all of your healing items and miscellaneous consumables. I didn\\'t notice much story: go beat the evil queen, slap some weird bosses around, give a bunny some bugs. But never you mind that. Momodora sports gorgeous visual stylings and a no-nonsense combat system I think any old-school gamer is going to love. It\\'s a good game with 2D platformer, seriusly i like this game a lot.\\nit\\'s about a priestess who\\'s land has been afflicted by a curse, and are searching to find a way to fix it, going to the source.\\n\\n[h1] Pros : [/h1]\\n+ Nice Story\\n+ Nice soundtrack\\n+ Amazing gameplay\\n+ Good boss fights\\n+ Good replayablity\\n+ Pretty challenging \\n+ A fair amount of secrets and illusory walls;\\n+ New Game+\\n+ Various endings ([spoiler] 2 endings so far [/spoiler] )\\n\\n+ [spoiler] Oh you can play as cat LOL [/spoiler]\\n\\n[h1] Cons : [/h1]\\n- it\\'s short game , i wish it was longer \\n- Pretty difficult (especially some of those achievements)\\n\\nOh my suggestion is to use control rather than a keyboard. because it is easier\\n\\n[quote=Noume] well.. it\\'s like Dark Souls with little girls LOL [/quote]\\n\\nIf you like a Metroidvania type of game, Get it now! While rather short (probably 5-8hrs for a normal playthrough) it does offer a very nice experience in that time.\\n\\nA cute looking metroidvania which heavily encourages learning to evade and counter your foes above trying to facetank and mash them down. Something you really cannot do with how comparatively fragile the player is to the enemies and your limited stock of heals carried(replenished at save/warp points) instead the game notably features a dodgeroll useful in avoiding damage from both enemies and traps.\\n\\nThe combat and movement feel nice especially during boss battles where all your abilities such as the melee combos, chargable ranged attacks, and dodges, get to shine fully. \\n\\nAll of this is wrapped together nicely by a solid soundtrack and lovely visuals.\\n\\nA good, if a bit small as a game of this type. This game is a great metroidvania, you will not be disappointed. A lot of games get called metroidvania, but Momodora is very much Symphony of the Night but harder. However, that\\'s a good thing. Symphony of the Night was a great game, and Momodora is also a great game. Common enemies slaying you as you run back to a boss can get frustrating, but it\\'s the good kind of frustrating, and the added challenge of trying to kill bosses without getting hit to get their item adds a lot of depth to the combat. Once I picked it up I could barely put it down until I was finished. Superb. *Ahem*\\n\\nWell, I\\'ll say it\\'s alright. And it is. It\\'s just not particularly fantastic as the \"overwhelmingly positive\" would have you believe though. I spent a pretty good amount of time on it as it managed to compel me enough to get the true ending.\\n\\nI think what held it back from being spectacular was a lack of character and story/meaningful upgrades.\\n\\nThis game is fun enough to play on it\\'s own even if there\\'s no big reason to play it other than you want to play it, but there\\'s not really anything to the plot though. There\\'s not even much context other than everyone\\'s just talking about the plague or how it\\'s a dangerous place, or the queen; and not in a particularly impactful way either. Nobody really has anything meaningful to say. They may as well just be nondescript NPCs, even the main character herself.\\n\\nThey could have made up for this if they had thrown the story out the window and made it more of a game by having some meaningful upgrades to keep things fresh, but it never goes beyond jumping over gaps and hitting enemies. The only upgrades you get are things that make your bow/leaf better (but you still use them the same way you always did) and a midair dash. \\n\\nOverall it just feels like a pretty average game\\n\\nI can\\'t really say that it\\'s bad. I\\'m not even upset about having spent the ~$8 on it. I just have a hard time actually recommending it to people, because to be honest, your time might be better spent playing something else if you\\'re motivated by a sense of purpose for doing what you\\'re doing, or if you want some actual \"character\" from your characters, or if you want a game that mixes things up and presents you with new kinds of challenges over time.\\n\\nIf you just plain like Metroidvania you may end up liking this as a result based on that fact alone. \\nI\\'m pretty sure that\\'s why I don\\'t find it to be a bad game. It\\'s just not good enough for a recommendation. A fun metroidvania with great music, and fun gameplay what more could you ask for? I really goddamn love this game. It\\'s my first indie/pixelated/thingy game that i\\'ve played. Would I play it again? Hell. Yes. But seriously, apart from the trouble with controls and unclear parts such as the wind dash (might have just been a lack of me paying attention/sucking) I think it\\'s a worthy investment. Kawaii Souls\\nPrepare to moe edition Chibi Souls confirmed, but no really it\\'s a pretty overall good platformer, with a challenging learning curve for people new to the genre, but a very satisfying payoff. Would recommend :) Fantastic little Metroidvania that kept me so interested I beat it in one sitting!\\nThe artwork is fantastic.\\nControls are super tight.\\nThe animation quality and level design is top tier.\\n\\nOnly one con however, the game is too short.\\nDefinitely buy this game and play it! You will NOT regret it! An outstading game. It definately brings me vibes of Dark Souls nearly throught out the whole game! The way the save points work, the heals and the world atmosphere is awesome. Like literally playing a relatively easy 2D version of DS. I truly recommend this awesome game!\\n\\nP.S: It even has NG+ I turned into A kitty.  10/10 game of the year. It\\'s short (about four hours for my first playthrough on Normal) but it\\'s exactly the length it needs to be. Great aesthetic, heavy Soulsborne influence that works very well, overall pleasant experience. I enjoyed it. Cool combat mechanics.\\nPretty unique artstyle.\\nSuper Cute character.\\nThough shorter than the average castlevania, but it has enough various secrets to discover while playing again.\\n\\nA must for every Castlevania fan. Stunning, astounding. Unique in its own kind. Momodora gets you from the beginning to the end, with the original and creative characters that you can find and hardly forget after finishing the game, their own personalities make them feel alive to us, the mystery behind them, it\\'s just brilliant. \\nThe music is so catchy, it always fit with the different scenarios that the game offers us. \\nBoss fights are pure epicness, and the difficulty is the right one.\\nAnd, the dynamic and enchanced graphics of the game. Who said that a 2D game can\\'t have such graphics? I think each time I play and close my eyes, I can feel like I was inside the game, so screw the Virtual Reality things that are so popular nowadays, play this game and forget about everything, just for a moment.\\nDo I recommend it? Yeah, waste every single cent you\\'ve got for this game, you will enjoy it so much. This is a good game if your into platforming with a hint of metroid like mechanics. \\nPros:\\n-basic combat mechnics that suit the character\\n-Good boss battles\\n-good map design with various areas to explore\\n\\nCons:\\n-The characters dont really flesh out enough, there no additional info from the character interaction nor info on their back ground. For example the witch, I wanted to know more about her and why she came to the city. \\n-the game is short, thats not nessarly a bad con, it was a good lenth, but for others looking for a big adventure, you may be disapointed. Its not a very long game, but for whats there. there\\'s a good 4-5 hours of fun to be had. Its one of those games that are for people who like the idea of new game plus modes to extend your playtime. While enjoyable the game doesn\\'t have much content past a couple hours.\\n\\nThe gameplay itself is a Metroidvaina type game with the combat and narrative aspects of the dark souls games. For lack of a better word the experience of it was a nice surprise. I definetly intend to back and playthrough this game a few more times to find things such as hidden items, pathways, and even alternative endings.\\n\\nIn the end, for a game with a great art style, a beloved style of play, and even its narrative, that while short, its totally worth the money to put into it.\\n\\nFInal verdict: 9/10 Two words to describe this game, 1. Frustrating, 2. Woah.\\nSaw this game last night, and decided to pick it up as well as Momodora 3 this morning, both for under 10$. What a steal, these are amazing indie games. While reverie under the moonlight is great, the only, ONLY, thing that bothered me about it is how much it copies from the Dark Souls/Bloodborne series. Other than that its amazing. The pixel graphics are beautifully done, soundtrack is lovely, and the bosses are very difficult. I only played on easy and got quite frustrated at some of them, but was well worth getting through the hard times. Game took me about 5 hours, however i got the bad ending and went back to do some criteria to get the good ending, which took about another hour. Overall spent 4 hours in Momodora 3 this morning and 6 hours in Momodora 4 this afternoon, and was time well spent. Recommended!\\n9/10 fun metroidvania with a good atmosphere, but some of the music is too sad, and the setting is overwhelmingly desolate, even if you take into account the Dark Souls influence.\\n\\nWorth your time if you\\'re into the genre Beautiful game with a perfect pixel art and charismatic characters and boss fights (Lubella is one hell of a bouncy fight).\\nThe OST is also pretty good, leaving you some vibes to the dark souls OST tho most of the people like to call this \"The blodborne of the cave storys\". Either way, the developer is a bro and i\\'m looking forward to see what\\'s his next work.\\n\\nThis game has been so important to me that i have buyed it to at least five friends, it\\'s always good to let people know about games like this one. Excellent metroidvania with some souls-like elements. \\nReally the only thing that could be a con is the length, but it seemed just right for me. short and sweet Metroidvania game Overall a great platformer with smooth controls and fun gameplay. That\\'s all you ever need for a Metroidvania.\\n\\nMy only two nitpicks:\\n\\n1. Some bosses are too easy.\\n2. Game is short and can be finished in less than 5 hours. See my playtime.\\n\\n This is a very short game with a mountain of untapped potential that could have been one of the greatest metroidvania games ever created. As it is, it\\'s still a phenomenal appetizer for the genre with shades of Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Shovel Knight.\\n\\nJust don\\'t overthink it or get too invested in any of the characters, because they\\'re little more than interesting signposts and the journey is over just as suddenly as it begins.\\n\\nI can see it being a good speed run game. One of the best platformers I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nThe atmosphere, the music, the gameplay, all come together to make a fantastic experience.\\n\\nThe plot is a bit vague but you can piece it together reasonably well after finishing the game. I would recommend this game to anyone that is likes the combat in Dark Souls and don\\'t mind dying too much. This game does have some of your typical Dark Souls mechanics like invincibility frames and Estus Flasks (they are Bellflowers in this game). Also the way you fight enemies and bosses in this game is similar to how you would in Dark Souls, since you have to remember enemy attack patterns and movement in order to be successful and not take too much damage, since you are very fragile in this game. The animations this game is very fluid, which makes combat a very pleasing experience. One of the few things I disliked is how backing tracking early on is really frustrating, especially when the area you want to go is all the way on the other side of the map. And you\\'ll most likely be backtracking a whole lot since it is required to beat the game. Although there is a warp mechanic, you get it pretty late into the game, and even so, you are very limited to where you can warp to. [spoiler] The last thing that I disliked is how one of the last bosses in the game had their closest checkpoint several rooms away. This annoyed me because the path to that boss from that checkpoint has several enemies that can half your health, forcing you to use your Bellflowers before you can fight the boss. [/spoiler]\\n\\nPros:\\n- Dark Souls like combat\\n- Fluid Animations\\n- Challenging Bosses and Enemies\\n- Interesting Ending\\n- Replayability with New Game + and hidden collectables\\n\\nCons:\\n- Backtracking is a pain\\n- First playthrough is short, if you don\\'t do New Game + It\\'s a damn fine game that I picked up because it looked cool. I was not disappointed. Really fun game. Only downside is the duration - I beat it in approximately 5 hours. Despite brevity, the game was very immersive and controls well. The enemies and enviroments are varied and keep you on your feet. All around enjoyable experience. I\\'d love to see more games or content for this series. This game in terms of tone and story is a lot like a slightly cutesy Metroid/Dark Souls hybrid. So if that\\'s enough to sell you, you have nothing to worry about, pick it up.\\n\\nNow for the gameplay that\\'ll decide it for the rest of us. Momodora is a 2d platformer rpg-light. You don\\'t strictly level up, but you do buy items and get more powerful as you go. It\\'s mostly your simple side scrolling metroid-vania style game. You have a melee attack with a 3 hit combo, and a long range you can charge up. Then as you get more items that upgrade your abilities, you can progress to other areas. Again, fairly standard.\\nWhat\\'s also bog standard is that inevitable moment where you\\'re not sure where to go anymore and end up going all over the map multiple times. Perhaps this is intentional, as it made enemy attack patterns get easier to predict. But either way that moment isn\\'t fun. This problem has plagued metroidvania games for years, and the only solution made has been to tell you where to go outright. Which naturally feels like being treated like an idiot. Which also detracts from the experience. Momodora doesn\\'t go this route of holding your hand. So unless you\\'re prepared for this moment, it\\'s gonna break the fun you\\'re having.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to really explain much else. It\\'s a fairly simple game that doesn\\'t break much ground. You can already see the animation and art quality on display. And the music is easily found online. If you only want these two aspects, you\\'ve practically already got them now.\\nI do however, recommend playing through the game to get it all in one package. You aren\\'t exactly missing out by not doing so. But it is still a good game in its own right. Just a slightly forgetable one when you get down to mechanics. I\\'ve just started this game, 2 bosses in now and I am LOVING it. It has a very soulsbourne feel to it, from the style to the difficulty. Absolutely beautiful game I couldn\\'t recomend it more! I absolutly love this game the art style and the combat remind me of a 2d dark souls aboslutly love this seires and hope there will be more down the road :D I\\'m a lot into platformers, especially in metroidvania style (eg. all 2D-castlevanias, Ori and the blind forest, but also Indie games like Lyle in Cube Sector, Within A Deep Forest, Doukutsu Monogatari). I do not like this one though. The tiles/background pixelart is inconsistent, sometimes on a good level, at (most) others very average or less. Same goes for the characters - some have a very good style and are fluently and naturally animated, while others, especially normal enemies, look boring. There\\'s some ambient music and some piano pieces, but none of them offers a catchy theme/tune. Biggest problem is the gameplay. The character movement feels stiff, slow and boring... and somewhat wrong. Enemy movement patterns are also stiff and monotonous. Their projectiles show some variation, but aren\\'t very challenging. Unfortunately, there was no relevant story to make the 3-4 hours of gameplay somewhat enjoyable. All in all, this game shows some good elements, which could use some technical improvements in all categories (graphics [improve consistent colour keys, learn to develop more creative, unique designs, for example by studying different art styles and combining them], music [don\\'t just play chords and scales up and down; improve theme melodies that are implemented in different variations], controls [improved fluency], gameplay [more diverse enemy movement], storytelling [show the story by the help of events, don\\'t just tell it] )... This game is clearly one of the better games I\\'ve ever played. Quite depressing story (without spoiling anything) though, with a beautiful sound design and beautiful garphics too, especially this kind of pixel art which I really like. \\n\\nI don\\'t have finished the game yet, but I\\'m on my way, and to admit it it was a hell of a story, except it was a little short. But it\\'s not a RPG so it\\'s okay. For me it was clearly the game of the year. Big love Id like to say im not a person who plays alot of these types of games but have played undertale and a few other sorts (Like LiEat, fantastic game btw) But this game was so enchanting to me. The music, the artstyle, the mechanics! They just shot out at me and its truly a wondeful game especially for those who like a little challenge cause its way more than a simple button masher, The game throws you into the world with a bow and a leaf and thats all you get for the rest of the game and it definatly gives you a good challenge. I could go on about the mucis too, but this is a game where youd get more out of the experience rather than a comment. So enjoy!~ Five key points of a perfect platformer: smooth controls and graphics, powerful mood/atmosphere/emotions, satisfying combat and movement, rewarding sense of progression, and finally sufficient depth of gameplay.\\n\\nThis game is anime Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. One of the best games ever made.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have is that it\\'s too short, but that\\'s personal preference. You like DarkSouls? You like 2D pixel games? If your answer is yes, then this game is right for you if annybody would aknowlege the fact that i am a cat that would be a nice touch * UNCONTROLLABLE WINKAGE TOTHE DEVELOPPERS * 10\\\\10 very good metroidvania. I would recomend playing the other games.\\n iz gud unlike momodora 3\\'s secrets along the main path, momodora RUTM opens up its world depending on what paths you can explore/survive and what secrets and items you aquire while doing so.  i found 1 item in one path, a massively branching path elsewhere, and a boss fight in the other.  as these paths streatched otu further the massive path opened into even more and more, far beyond what i was expecting, and a path i needed ti figure out in order to advance while on the other spectrum it had a boss fight i coudlnt handle, on the other path starting from the earlier boss fight, i eventually found 2 different worlds to explore and each their own boss fights.  not to mention that each area of momodora has its own unique challenges and traps.  i wasnt able to handle 2 of these bosses, but was much more prepared after choosing the exploring path after many failed fights.  i was able to get 2 items that helped me defeat one boss then the other, the game does not unfold as this sequence however and it was mainly what i was able to work with and able to handle that determined my choices along these paths.\\n\\nthe dodge mechanic, whlie still not a big fan of it, works nicely into the game, especially in boss fights, being not jsut a requirement but adding to the action and reaction of many of the attacks.  i feel if i practiced the ddoge mechanic more my entertainment of the game woldve only tripled as i wouldve avoided more deaths and hits. instead of sitcking to just sticking to mostly running or jumping out of everything.\\n\\nA lot of the frustrations i had on my hard mode run (was the onyl run ive done but i enjoy challenges) was the lack of health in the later areas as you\\'ll find yourself having to use up your healing options once for hit bascially and some  of the slower enemeis not only one shot you at your beginning health but could end runs while you were exploring.  i wnet through most the game until i back tracked looking for health upgrades and especailly in the beginning area i found many of them. \\n\\nlet me explain why this health system was so well done by the developers:\\n-  the health you start with is decent enough if you want a harder playthrough\\n-  the secrets are easily findable with soem exploration\\n-  theres even a passive item you get early on that rings when you enter a room with a secret, be it health upgrade, more bellflowers (yes, you can get far more than simply 3 health items and will likely need to, not only that but your bellflowers are competely refillable like your other tiems every time you use a save point), ive far more than doubled my starting and even upgraded health from the backtracking, i\\'ve 15 out of the 20 health upgrades ive read online and backtracking was made easier with each upgrade i got and the ring of candor made it much easier to help locate each secret so im not mindless running and smashing each wall for secrets.\\n-  game still packs a challenge so i dont feel like ive simply too much health to jsut ignore enemies and run recklessly towards the next save point tanking the dmg like its nothing.\\n\\nafter getting to the final boss, my only gripe really so far i\\'d say that isnt subjective on my preferences is that i had no diea of knowing that you get special items for killing bosses without being hrut at all, i wish i coudlve seen something like this laid out or said to me.  its a bit of a secret adn the only item i got of it so far was this rain of terror from a boss that was so small adn easy i didnt think anyhting of it.  while it immedately switches to a uch harder boss during.  i just took it as a simple victory item for kiling the boss, i dont remember if i got an item for the first boss but that wouldve been a sign if i didnt.  just makes me sad becuase without that info i have no motivation for doing a no hit on the bosses.  the items achieved look quite fun and useful as well Incredibly fun game. Tight, satisfying combat and enough content to justify the pricetag. Definitely worth a buy if you like good music, tight platforming, and Metroid-inspired gameplay. I\\'m very bad at this game. I give up :( Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is unabashedly a 2D Dark Souls game, and it is wonderful. It\\'s a 2D metroidvania with a dark atmosphere, many dodge rolls, really great art style, solid animation, and a short-but-satisfying play time. It\\'s 10 bucks, so it\\'s a steal for how solid of a game it is. It also seems to be on sale pretty often as well. I like this game. But the NPC\\'s don\\'t like me and tell me to leave all the time... One of the best games I\\'ve ever played. Short and sweet with great challenges for everyone. Easily one of the most entrancing experiences I\\'ve had to date. The gameplay and controls are well polished, the music fits the beautifully done environments, and the variety of enemies and bosses added to both the challenge the game poses and the uniqueness of the areas. Momodora RUtM\\'s story really makes you feel the struggles of the characters (and a few bosses). If you are a fan of Metroidvania style games, I couldn\\'t urge you more to choose Momodora RUtM. Great Metroidvania\\n\\nPROS\\n+Nice soundtrack\\n+Great Bosses\\n+Big game world(way bigger than 1,2 or 3 parts of the game)\\n+Nice difficulty\\n+Good replayablity\\n+New Game+\\n+Various endings\\n\\nCONS\\n-Final Boss is easy as pie\\n\\nGreat Metroidvania.Boss battles are great,exploration is really great.This game really offers a challenge and after first walkthrough you will get even harder difficulty.Buy it and play it! Game is amazing and fun I actually enjoyed the concept it has a slight castlevania feel and the battling is nice too, I might have made some pretty awkward mistakes xD but other than that was an amazing experience and I urge all to give it a shot!\\nhttps://youtu.be/nUSthW5d5p4 A very exciting metroidvania action platformer.  I\\'m actually glad I started with this game first as it\\'s the prequel to the series.  If you\\'re looking to reminesce your childhood playing on the SNES or Genesis, then this game will fill that hole.  It\\'s not too difficult but can also be frustrating at times.  Much like in Metroid, you can go into other areas in a non-linear fashion to find more upgrades for your health.  There are a few surprises too much like in the Souls games if you explore enough.  Also, much like the souls games, you use areas to rest at to save the game and replenish your health items, of which you only have a finite amount.  Once they\\'re gone, you need to save again.  All in all, a fantastic game. Kaho used leaf blade\\nIt\\'s super effective! es precioso Great graphics + Great music + Great controls + Great boss battles = Good times.\\n\\nIf you are on the fence about buying this game - Just buy it.\\nQuit sitting on THE FENCE. If you haven\\'t played Momodora RUTM yet, or any of the Momodora games, let me give you a few pieces of advice.\\n\\nWRT the first three Momodora games: You do not have to have played them at all, to play RUTM. If you want an idea of the gameplay of the other three, it\\'s very Cavestory-ish. A metroid-vania with simple controls and brutally hard bossfights (and areas in general), savepoints dotted around for full heals, and a focus on melee and certain spells from what I recall of the little I played of them. THey\\'re good, but I am a no-skill scrub so I got nowhere fast with the first two :<\\n\\nWRT RUTM however, this game is like if Castlevania : Symphony of the Night had an illicit and passionate affair with Dark Souls and their twin Bloodborne, then Castlevania\\'s wife Touhou walked in and saw the whole thing and would be mad except they found it kind of hot?\\n\\nWhat I\\'m trying to say is you have Castlevania\\'s classic metroidvania gameplay and huge bosses and super beautifully detailed sprites and huge roster of cool enemies to fight, a big map, powerups to gain, items to equip to grant bonuses and such, and then it\\'s got this great Touhou-esque feel of the designs of all the characters (like 90% of which seem to be women; and badass ones at that, so that\\'s definately appreciated), plus you got the Soulsborne feel of the environments and the awesome dodgeroll and just how sinister and creepy some bits feel, and lots of lore on the item descriptions and with the worldbuilding via dialogue with NPCs.\\n\\nPLUS you have a really rather nice soundtrack as well. This is a pure masterpiece. Best yet, because it\\'s a prequel to the other three Momodora games, you really don\\'t have to have played the other three! You can play this one straight off the bat with no prior knowledge of the series or its lore!\\n\\nSo seriously what the hell are you waiting for? Get in on this. It\\'s fantastic. Well designed combat system, cute characters, great BGM. Try it and you won’t regret.\\n\\nThe only pity is there is almost nothing about those featured bosses(e.g the girl who fights with a red blade), wanna see more story of them. This fantastic piece of work tastes like a spicy combo of megaman and dark souls. Its very well made and does not hold your hand much. This game also does hardmode the right way, in which you aren\\'t going to beat bosses through luck but through the fact that you completely mastered the fight. It also has a nice soundtrack which only helps.\\nWorth every penny.\\nBuy It. Really fun game. Metroidvania as hell.\\n\\nPROS:\\n+ double jump\\n+ aerial attack\\n+ niche weapon upgrade\\n+ BANGIN\\' soundtrack\\n+ passive mode\\n\\nCONS:\\n- wish it were longer (still comparable length to price (hardly a con))\\n\\nLETS FUKKEN GO Absolutely amazing. A must play!  \\n\\nFantastic music goes together great with the lovely sprite artwork, to create a wonderful atmosphere.\\n\\nTight controls, Fun mechanics and the dodgeroll ability elevates the gameplay well above most other 2D action platformers.\\n\\nMultiple difficulties ranging from hair tearing frustrating (yet entirely fair) to \"I\\'m just here for the atmosphere\"\\n\\nReplayabillity via achivements, secrets, and general challenge (the unlockable insane difficulty)\\n\\nLegitimately a perfect, incredibly tight and defined video game. 10/10\\n\\n So Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is my first introduction into Momodora series i enjoyed this game vary much. The beginning is slow but speed up after the first area the game is fun the sound is fantastic the controles are very responsive and the bosses have a level of get fucked similar to Dark Souls. I will say if your looking for a fun game with challenging boss fights Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game i think you might just fall in love with. one of the best metrodvaina games i\\'ve played in years \\n\\nthe only bad thing about it is that if you know what you are doing then you could finish the game in one sitting(of about 2-4 hrs) Addicting but not very fun... I do not enjoy this game very much i have almost beat it but not really enjoying it. Obsessed and in love with this game. Simple, yet intuitive with easy to use controls; as well as rage inducing difficulties, but they\\'re completely fair. On top of it all, the music is just motivating, emotional and memorable. \\nThis game surpasses it\\'s three predecessors in terms of gameplay, difficulty, and music and is my favorite in the Momodora series. \\nIndie gaming at it\\'s finest as well as being one of the most well developed Metroidvania in my book.\\nSide-note: Story is really whatever and unoriginal, but the lore is interesting and easy enough to follow.\\n\\nI recommend this game and is a must play for veterans of this genre. \\n[Strike]Tenouttaten[/Strike] 9/10 Aesthetic and awesome game, with very nice controls.\\n\\nQuite challening when playing on hard. it fun Just play this game when you have the chance. Call it Moe Souls if you want. It\\'s a really great 2D game with nods to DS and Castlevania, with simple melee / ranged combat and platforming, appealing art style (pixely SD anime girls, what!?) and a great soundtrack. Not too ridiculously hard yet (on Normal). Never heard of it until I bought it on sale at chrono.gg but honestly out of the games I\\'ve played this year it\\'s easily in my top ten for 2016 releases.\\n\\nBe forwarned, people are saying the game is a bit short. For the price they\\'re asking, I\\'d say it was worth it so far. I think it\\'ll take me about 4-6h to get to the end (I think there are multiple endings, please check), but I\\'d want to do a NG+ at least and try to find all the secrets.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m 5 hours in and there\\'s still much game left. It\\'s so good. Momodora 4 may look cutesy at first glance but this game will absolutely kick your arse.\\nIt\\'s a fairly straightforward metroidvania style game with power ups and items opening new paths for you to take on your journey to save your village from a curse coming from the city. Along the way you\\'ll meet quirky characters and grow your power but even with every upgrade equipped you\\'re still only a few hits away from death at any moment.\\n\\nI absolutely recommend Momodora 4, the challenge is never unfair and the world is wonderful to explore without being overwhelmingly huge like other metroidvania games. There\\'s enough secrets that you\\'ll likely come back for a second playthrough too.\\n\\nI\\'ll give Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight 9 out of 10 maple leaves, would purify again. Great \"friday evening\" sort of a game. \\n\\nAn absolutely stunning metroidvania, full of character and beautiful aesthetics. It\\'s about 6hr play for the initial pplaythrough, which I feel is most appropiate: the combat mechanics are solid but not too varied nor in-depth, so it doesn\\'t outstay its welcome. \\n\\nSome (not too tricky to find) secrets and special item drops for vnaquishing bosses with no hits taken add extra replayability for the genre fans. \\n This game made me feel more emotions than Uncharted 4. It is a great speedrunning game and man I heard that it was like a 2D Dark Souls and that is true, but you can choose your difficulty so it allows a new player to get into the game easier than the souls games. I played on normal and now I want to go back and play it again but harder. Normal nets you a bit too much health in my opinion but seriously I\\'m in love. Momodora is like if Bloodborne and Super Metroid had a beautiful love-child who was really into anime.  The game is kinda short, but this is definitely a case of quality over quanitity.  The pixel art is beautiful, the music is inspired, the controls are tight and responsive, and the tone/ambience is very much on par with what you\\'d expect from a soulsbourne game.  Momodora also takes inspiration from anime, but in the best kind of way.  The characters, and even some of the enemies, are strong and adorable in equal measure.  There\\'s a layer of light-hearted cuteness that is subtle enough not to clash with the creepy setting, but rather serves to simply keep your spirits high in the midst of the challenges placed before you.  And the game does present a significant challenge, though I should note that I did play through it on hard difficulty.  Both the moment-to-moment stage traversal and the boss fights feel fair, balanced, and well-thought out.  The boss fights are of particular note in that they do not simply represent a challenge.  These encounters are engineered in such a way that they draw on your emotions and tug at your heart strings.  Again making the comparison to soulsborne games, I was at times reminded of fights such as Lady Maria from Bloodborne and the False Idol from Demon\\'s Souls, just to name a couple.  Also, there\\'s tons of secrets hidden throughout the game, and finding them all feels rewarding.  Everything you do in this game feels rewarding, regardless of how you decide to approach it.  There\\'s no filler or fluff.  It\\'s just 100% good, solid fun. If you\\'re a Souls fan you will definitely love this game. The game has an open-world-like feel to it and a lot of the areas are interconnected which makes opening shortcuts not only useful but satisfactory. Much like a Souls game if you rush through on your first playthrough you will end up dying a lot, but the mechanics are very easy to master so you\\'ll be slaying bosses in no time. The atmosphere of the game is also very well made, the music and ambience gives it a dark tone and the character sprites are consistent with the world.\\nI recommend this game 100%, my only con is that it feels a bit short, but I do understand that the team behind this is rather small and a game like this takes a lot of work to do. Kudos to the devs, keep it up. Overall, this game very exitced! Character, movement, background, musics, stories, secrets.\\nAlthough of appearance such as pixels, but this game is so incredible. I do not regret buying and playing this game until completed. An amazing platformer with a great soundtrack. The game captures the violent mythology atmosphere and the areas work perfectly with the crisp spritework. Has pretty damn good bosses too. Like many others here, the game felt a bit short. I\\'d recommend playing on hard because thats when the game shines most truly showing its ability to make you play while always preparing for what lies ahead. Its like dark souls, but 2-D, and with a leaf. This game is so damn fun! It is definitely worth the time; so check it out. I will not write a very long review as plenty of individuals have gone into much detail on this game. But after starting it tonight I could not ignore the opportunity to write a review which I seldom do. This game is one of the best 2D sidescrolling games I have ever played. Comparable to Dust: An Elysian Tale in regards to the addictive gameplay abeit simplistic. \\n\\nThere were two things that stood out to me when reading prior reviews. The first was smooth gameplay. I don\\'t typically think that would be used to describe a \"bit\" graphic stylized game, but here it could not be more true. The animations are extremely fluid and the shadowing effects are beautiful. The ambience of the world due to this is incredible. Which speaking of ambience, the second to mention thing is the soundtrack. The music is on point in this game giving an overall creepy and hopeless feeling in the world you are playing.\\n\\nI am not currently done with the game but the map shows me at 69% completion for finding all of the rooms. For record Steam shows my play time at 4.7 hours at the time of this review. I plan to finish this game very soon and look at what else this developer has done as they clearly know how to make one hell of a game.\\n\\nFinished Edit: I have just finished this masterpiece of a game and all the way up to the end it was fantastic. While I would like to go around and finish getting collectibles and achievements, I personally feel it would detract from my experience. I also have an insanely large back catalogue of games to finish.\\n\\nFor anyone on the fence about getting this game. Do yourself a favor and buy it! For this game in particular, this is basically Dark Souls/Bloodborne in 2D side scroller platform with great soundtrack and varies enemies. \\n\\nEven so difficulty on this game is similared to Dark Souls as punishment from error cost high vitual life bar as well as this game is quite short.\\n\\nStill for those who look for small challenge platform game, i would recommend this game. A very enjoyable 5 hour game.\\nIf you enjoy Metroid or Castlevania type games you\\'ll enjoy this.\\nbtw, the setting and story touched on a Dark Souls type vibe. So bonus right? Really cutie game with awesome ost and unforgettable style of pixel art :3\\nI did enjoy it, it was definitely worth its price Cat Granted me a hatred for dagger throwing imps. 10/10 Love this game This is my first Momodora game, but I enjoyed everything this game offered. The pixelated graphics weren\\'t an eyesore and the game wasn\\'t as simple as I thought it might be. If you like short games with really nice gameplay and a pretty good story, you may like this game. I sure did. An incredibly pretty game, with tight controls, good soundtrack and an interesting world.\\n10/10 would play again A great game with a good soundtrack that fits it. Controls are responsive, simple, and don\\'t get more complex than how they are in the beginning. Boss battles can get a bit challenging, but never feel like they\\'re impossible. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight has an impressive oppressive atmosphere that gives the game world a unique feeling of loneliness that\\'s more than fitting for it\\'s genre. Momodora: RUtM felt like it ended too early and left me wanting for more, though that might be because of how much I enjoyed the game. [strike]Also when\\'s Fennel mode? I want to play as pardoner waifu.[/strike] When this game showed up in my reccomedations, I bought it immediately- I was drawn in by that adorable art style! I kept playing for the challenging gameplay and mysterious lore. This is the fourth game in the series, a continued improvement over the last game, following the story of a side character you meet in Momodora 3. The controls are near perfect, the art style is gorgeous and the characters are interesting. The only complaint I have is that you don\\'t learn ENOUGH about some of the characters or bosses. Their motivations aren\\'t well explained, they don\\'t have any bearing on the plot and some of the more emotional moments are lessened because of the lack of information. Heck I hardly knew anything about Kaho- the main character- by the end! Overall; it\\'s an amazing game- just don\\'t expect to have all of your questions answered. game is AMAZING tottaly play it. Great game. Perfect length and doesn\\'t overstay its welcome, great music, great visuals and solid gameplay. Monster girls and shrine maidens. A classy Vania-like game that is just as much Souls as it is Castlevania. If it came sooner it would likely be another touhou. Really fun game, reminds me of Castlevania and the artwork is beautiful. This game was a pleasant suprise, it has all the right elements for a platform game. I recommend not passing this up. Small game found on a whim. Fun to play\\nTruly beautiful game with its gorgeous soundtrack and perfect art direction Disclaimer: It may say that i have only played a few hours of this game on the time of the writing of the review but i have already finished it once before on another account and gotten every ending so no im not writing bullshit\\n\\n\\nOK where to start. \\nIm really shocked and surprised that this game isnt selling more. It is literally one of the best metroidvania available out there. I started this and couldnt play ANYTHING ELSE till i finished it. THe soundtrack, atmosphere, gameplay, story everything is so GOOOOOD. Makes me wanna cry literally. I wont write too much but basically this game is what you get if you mixed dark souls with castlevania in 2d ! and leaning a bit more towards castlevania. I make this comparison because \\nthe story is dark and grim and you can feel the heavy atmosphere in each stage. but at the same time theres so many places to explore and really gives you that feeling of exploration from a metroidvania game. Also the game has a lot of focus and by that i mean that everything that happens/ is said is for a reason and nothing is pointless. the gameplay mechanics are very tight and feel great to play. the music is as melancholy as it is great ! My only problem with it would be that its really short and clocks in at only 8 hours. But if you think about it its worth every penny because they arent charging you full 60 for 8 hours but instead only 9. Just wish it was longer and could play it more\\n\\n\\nTl;Dr : THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC ! If u like metroidvania , souls like games  , castlevania like games. PLEEEEEEEEASE BUY THIS AND SUPPORT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE IT SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE This is an absolutely superb game. The combat is challenging (for me) and the world is immersive. Even though I had never played any of the other games in the series, I loved this game from the beginning to the end. If you like 2D side scrollers and thoughtful story telling, then you should definitely pick up this game. Amazing pixel animations. Really solid gameplay. Interesting lore. A damn great soundtrack. Some good replay value. Top notch boobs.\\n\\nWhat\\'s not to love? Great mix between castlevania and dark souls. -Fantastic metroidvania.  \\n-Smooth animation and controls.  \\n-Challenging without being frustrating.  \\n-Lacks a certain amount of depth but the gameplay more than makes up for it. Controls are hard to get used to, but when you do, you can do some cooooooooool stuff.\\n\\nAlso, this game made me cry. And I LOVE IT. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\\n\\nGreat game solid gameplay and controls (though I recommend a controller) beautiful music and graphics (I\\'m a sucker for pixel art) and quite challenging in harder difficulty levels. Heavily borrows ideas from the Souls series, and not in a bad way. Cute protagonist, fun boss fights, great music. Only bad thing I can say about it is the rather short length. Beautiful metroidvania game that isn\\'t too hard and isn\\'t too easy. Since I was a huge fan of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, I was curious to see how good this game was. After beating it surpassed my expectations and it has to be one of the best games I\\'ve played this year. I was really impressed. I couldn\\'t recommend it enough. Just buy it! I first saw this game at a GDQ and I loved it. I got this game on sale but I wish I could\\'ve paid full price for it. It\\'s a 2D MetroidVania meets Dark Souls. If you\\'re on the fence about it, get it anyway. This game deserves the The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award A dark and gloomy metroidvania with a Dark Souls-like method of storytelling.\\nWha-\\nWell of course it\\'s good, are you kidding me?!\\nWhith solid gameplay and no less than beautiful pixel art and animation, this game is a must for anyone interested in the genre.\\nIt\\'s a shame it\\'s so short... You can transform into a cat. 10/10. This is one of those games that you want to beat it, come back to it on a harder difficulty and beat it again. Love the game to pixels. Really good game, a lot harder than what it looks, and a very beautiful art.\\nHighly recommended I\\'ll nominate this game for \"Best Indie Metroidvania Game\", god we need an official award named like that. Even if the game is a bit short, it has tight and precise mechanics (if you die, is your fault not the controls), good prequel that makes me want to play to the other Momodora games when I can (this is the first time I play a Momodora game), plenty of secrets worth obtaining (really, Super Metroid pack of missiles were kind of useless in late game, frosty-i\\'ll-hit-u-through-walls beam or Screw attack was all you\\'ll ever need), challenging bosses (especially if you are going for a no-hit run), good soundtrack and atmosphere.\\n\\nWhat else could you ask? Nice graphics, nice sound track and sound effects. Although it lacks content, no upgrades to your melee attack until almost on the end, no different comboes, although great ranged attack infinite ammo... I don\\'t know, it lacks variation of weapons.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth the money, just don\\'t expect too much.  MRutm is an intense, beautiful, fighting its great Possible GOTY 2016 Was in the mood for a metroidvania game, and the store page looks pretty cool. Got it when it was on sale and I couldn\\'t be happier. This game is pretty awesome. \\n\\nScratches all the right itches of exploring, collecting, and fighting. Plently to see and things to learn. Also it can be pretty challenging, but fair. Also it looks beautiful and has a great soundtrack and atmosphere. \\n\\n10/10 Would recommend. Feels good with a controller as well. A short, but lovely 2D platformer that plays like a cross between Soulsborne, Castlevania and pixel art anime girls. The music is nice, the sprites are delightfully animated, and the bosses are (mostly) fantastic. Pick it up on sale.\\n\\nAlso, you can turn into a kitty and fight a giant witch by smacking her in the boobs with a leaf. Fairly short game, but it was well worth it and the boss fights are challenging but doable.  I never felt like I was dying to some random chance.  I knew each time that I was the one making mistakes with the fight mechanics or I had not gotten the correct item to make the fight easier.  The story is pretty light and dialog can be confusing and generally only gives you a vague idea of what your purpose is, but overall you begin to get an idea of what you are doing; even if it never really expands on any backstory or reason for what is happening in the world.    \\n\\nControl and fight mechanics were clean and simple and never felt cumbersome.  Overall an enjoyable experience. The game is not particularly long (it\\'s runnable in under 4 hours easily if you aren\\'t stopping to explore), however the time I played the game packed challenging and fun fights (the combat borrows from Dark Souls a lot), a great creepy-cute atmosphere, and an impeccable soundtrack.\\n\\nWell worth the money, especially if it\\'s on sale. A great platform based exploration game with a strong but silent (like Gordon Freeman) female protagonist.  If you like any of the side scrolling Metroid games from Nintendo, you will be very happy.  The gamepad controls are extremely responsive and the in-game menus are setup to allow the pad to execute everything without need for your keyboard.  The story and characterization are somewhat vague but they provide enough detail to keep it interesting and driving you on to the next area.\\n\\nI have not beaten the game, as yet, but it seems that, like Super Metroid, it would be an awesome game to speedrun.\\n\\nHighly recommended at any price! Combining the spirit of the Souls franchise with the gameplay of Symphony of the Night, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a joy to play. At its core, this game is basically a 2D Metroid-style exploration game, with an emphasis on melee combat. Most of the map can be tackled in any order the player sees fit. Adjustable difficulty settings allow for the game to be accessible to people of nearly all skill levels, so even though I started this review with a comparison to Dark Souls, casual players need not be scared off and expert players will certainly find a challenge in the higher difficulty levels. The game even includes a New Game + mode right out of the Souls series, with tweaked enemy encounters during your subsequent playthrough.\\n\\nThe pixel art is gorgeous and the soundtrack is appropriately moody, but the real reason to play this game is the basic kinesthetics of play. The simple action of moving, jumping, and fighting are expertly honed to just feel good, weighty, and impactful. Simply put, just moving around the main character alone is worth the price of admission. Add to that smart level design, moody atmosphere, well designed boss encounters, and a vaguely defined melancholic story (right out of the Dark Souls school of story telling) and the result is an exemplary exploration based 2D platformer. Challenging and with a great atmosphere. I just wish it was longer. This is a fantasic little game. A bit on the short side but every other aspect of the game is so carefully crafted and enjoyable that its still worth every penny. As a fan of metroidvania games, I bought this game thinking it would be like most other games of that genre. This is true to ome extent, but it is my favorite game of the genre. It focuses less on the movement options, but makes up for it with everything else about the game. The music is fantastic; some of my favorite video game music ever. In addition, the graphics are great, and go with the theme very well. The gameplay is fun, and it never seems easy. If played on the harder difficulties, you will find yourself getting  ery frustrated, but something about the whole experience pushes you to keep going. I never thought that a game could be so beautuful, and somehow Momomdora Reverie Under the Moonlight managed that as weel as an amazing sountrack and fun gamplay. If you are a fan of Metroidvania games, or are new the the genre, I cant recoment this game enough. The only thing negative about this game I have to say is that I wished it was longer. I played it twice, on different difficulties, and both times I finished wanting more of the game. Again, if you are thinking about getting this game, Just buy it, and play it. Probably one of the best platformers I\\'ve ever played. This is a Dark Souls-esque, 2D platforming Metroidvania, single-player game, if you were at all skeptical. \\nMore importantly, this game is awesome.  \\nThe art is some of the best, most fluid pixel-art I\\'ve seen. \\nThe dialogue/story/atmosphere is reminiscent of and just as enthralling as what I experienced in the Dark Souls series, without being a ripoff; It\\'s got a more \\'Miyazaki\\' quality anime style to it.\\nFor seasoned Dark Souls and/or platformer gamers, I\\'d highly recommend this one.  If you\\'re well invested in *both* genres, go right ahead and start on hard difficulty.  It\\'s well worth the challenge, and it fills you with that appropriate sense of hopelessness and struggle that you\\'d want from a Souls game!\\nLastly, it does have an \\'extreme\\' mode, for all you hardcore gamers. The love child of Dark Souls and Symphony of the Night. Not many games feel this good to play. Great metroidvania with a great atmosphere, tight controls and fantastically pretty pixels. Juicy, pixelated goodness wrapped in an action-platformer\\'s paradise, topped with eleven succulently flavorful boss fights, and served with a side of beautifully crafted, flame broiled backgrounds, and a blended cocktail of ambience and an atmospheric soundtrack.\\n\\nDelivered on a plate of the finest Metroidvania exploration and with a challenging, yet fair, difficulty on the house.\\n\\nNow try and tell me that\\'s a meal you wouldn\\'t love to eat everyday. Seriously, if you enjoy incredibly tightly-controlled platformers, and have even a passing interest in Castlevania-style games, this is absolutely for you. This game is GREAT! It has a Dark Souls feel, which I highly enjoy. It\\'s the right level of challenging while still being a lot of fun and really enjoyable. Really love the music, which sets the tone for each area you adventure to. Holy shit!  Goog freaking game, expecially for the price, I mean, wow.  If you like platformers like FEZ, but hated the pointlessness of that one, you\\'ll love momodora. The gameplay and the controls are excellent.  The graphics are top-notch, the sound effects are Atari-like, and the music is very emotional, but low-key.  My only minor complaint would be that there\\'s no setting for turning on screen-sync, because once in a while there\\'s tearing.  But it\\'s rare compared to most games.  Mos\\' def worth a purchase imho. Verry nice game, I liked it! This game is like a mink, it\\'s cute and adorable.\\nBut it\\'ll nip ya, a nasty one too. Absolutely fantastic Metroidvania, solidly difficult RUtM will challenge you, but its never unfair, the music is oozing with atmosphere: By that I mean the music and the enviorment combine to make you really feel tense and it gets the \"creepy feeling\" of the game down.\\n\\n The areas you must traverse are pretty fun to run through/get hit in, the bosses are fun and challenging as well. Despite having a somewhat small pool of moves, you have enough to deal with whatever the game throws at you, and none of game really \"Spikes\" in difficulty. \\n\\nA great game if you love the genre, the art is also pretty nice, reminds me of Cave Story. There is also plenty to do in terms of challenges, I\\'ve only completed the game once, but I already know i\\'ll be revisiting this title again and again. Fantastic metrovania type platformer with melee and ranged combat.\\nThe scenery and background story is reminiscent of Dark Souls with very cool enemy designs and environments.\\n\\nSomewhat short with some replay value in the New Game + mode.\\n\\nOverall, I absolutely loved it and wished it was longer or had a sequel. Very challenging, but very fun. Changed the keys around a bit and really love it. Gameplay is clean and the level design is excellent. Just play it. rlygood/10 A short but very, very sweet metroidvania experience with fantastic pixel art, satisfying combat, and plenty of clever secrets. Absolutely worth playing, even if you haven\\'t picked up the other games in the series. Demon\\'s souls metroidvania gorgeous pixelated kawaii looking amazing great atmospheric game with a marvellous OST Great Metroidvania! Wonderful game for a small price, if you are interested in action platformers, then you can\\'t go wrong with this one If you like sidescroller/plataformers this game is a must play. There\\'s no other quite like it, as it differs from other plataformers in many aspects. \\nThis game has some ideas and mechanics inspired by Souls games, that blend surprisingly well in a 2D game.\\n\\nThe level design is more or less open to explore and filled with shortcuts, which makes it interesting to replay as you have to tackle the enemies from another angle or fight bosses with different abilities.\\n\\nEven with simple combat mechanics, the game is rich and very fun to play. \\nI\\'ve spent more than 17 hours playing and replaying it and still find myself wanting more.\\n\\nHighly recommend trying to play pacifist and the Insane (OHKO) difficulty. The comparison to Dark Souls is almost impossible to make, but it really is such a good take on the formula in 2D. The controls are super tight, the fights are fun as heck, and all the art/music/atmosphere has that signature Momodora Charm. I didn\\'t think it was possible ot make a game that I liked more than Momo 2, but this one far and away takes the cake. [i]I will not be going over the story or characters in the game. That is for anyone willing to give the game a try.[/i]\\n\\nIf you like Metroidvania games not just in level design, but also with obtaining new items and upgrades later into the game, then this is a game for you. \\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight was a game I was expecting mediocrity from, but was pleasantly surprised after the second boss. I played through the game on the \"hard\" difficulty, and while there were some attacks from enemies that killed me in one hit, I actually never felt frustrated with the game. I have also not played any of the other Momodora games, but I am considering them after playing this. \\n\\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\\n\\nI\\'m not a particular fan of pixel art, nor do I drool over games that use pixel art. The pixel art to me is good, and I have no complaints with it. What I do like about the visuals is the use of contrast between the areas of the game, specifically the first area. \\n\\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\\n\\nCoupled with the visuals is the music, which combined makes some good atmosphere for a 2D pixel game. I will also go so far as to say that the music even stands on its own. If you sometimes listen to music from games outside of playing them, I would recommend the soundtrack. The sound effects are retro in nature. I don\\'t have much to say about the sounds. Nothing sticks out to me, though they make good use of the sounds as a que for some enemies to attack. \\n\\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\\n\\nThe game\\'s combat consists of a melee attack (which you can perform in the air), a bow for ranged attacks (which you can charge), using a consumable items that either casts an attack spell or buffs you, and a dodge with I would say some very generous I-frames (invincibility frames). \\n\\nThe game goes off of a checkpoint system similar to Dark Souls with bonfires, but there is no autosave in the game and you save at these checkpoints (shrines). Health is restored and status effects are removed when you rest at them (save). Any consumable items you purchase or find in the game that have limited uses are also replenished when you rest at shrines. It\\'s very streamlined and the game wants the player to keep moving. \\n\\nI\\'ve seen some complain that the game is too short. While I can agree with this, I don\\'t really see it as a negative. A first blind playthrough of the game I think would take someone maybe 4 hours to get through, but to collect everything in the game would require another play through [spoiler](yes there is new game+, but hardly anything changes)[/spoiler]. \\n\\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\\n\\nI found the game to be very enjoyable, and for a 2D pixel game it has some good atmosphere. It is short, but I don\\'t see this as a negative. If anything it should push anyone to want to replay it and collect everything. \\n\\n[b]For people who like a score[/b]: 8/10 Everything about this game is wonderful! The art, the soundtrack, the controls, the story, the gameplay mechanics. The only bad thing is that it LEAVES you wanting more. This is my favorite game released this year. Great platforming with diffecult enemies and bosses. Pick it up if you\\'re looking for a solid 2-d platformer. Best 8-Bit Boobies ever!!! just a really good game A fun, somewhat non-linear metroidvania. You gradually learn what\\'s going on in the game from snippets of convesation from the various characters. It\\'s a game inspired by Cave Story and Dark Souls, so expect some similarities in story telling and gameplay. A great mix of metroidvania exploration and Dark Souls combat.  Highly recommended a really cool and challenging metroidvania style game.  Worth playing A huge step up in quality and design from Momodora III (and I loved this game), Momodora RUtM leaves the stage progression behind and offers one single map you can explore in the order you chose (post-SotN Castlevania comes to mind). The game looks beautiful and the spritework is incredibly cute and pleasant to look at. \\nThe music, while on the more ambiant side does a great job at conveying various mood through your journey. \\nThe combat feels great, even though the roll is a bit tricky to master since the invincibility frames are scarce. Bossfights are tough but not too hard and I\\'ve never felt the game was being cheap or injust to me.\\nThe plot is minimalist and is told in a way that invites comparison to Dark Souls or Bloodborne.\\nIt\\'s way longer than Momodora III (which took me like 5 hours to 100%) but you will most likely finish it in about 10h or less, it does have some good replay value though, especially if you intend to 100% it, which is tough but far from impossible.\\n\\nOverall great atmosphere, great bossfights, lovely 2D art and a nice difficulty curve. At one point I placed this on my Steam wish list and then promptly forgot about it. To my memory as to why I\\'m not sure. That aside I\\'m really enjoyed the 5 or so hours I\\'ve sent on this and while I have yet to get to the end I feel completed to do a write up about it.\\n\\nFull review - http://www.minusinfinite.net/2016/05/game-review-momodora.html I bought this game because my favorite emoticons :momocat: and: momozzz: belong to this nice and cute game, I really love cats :) seemed right not? Now I do the review to complete the autumn sales badges :D...i think this is my best review.\\np.s. : pls devs add a couple cats emoticons ;) Quick game that can easily be done in an hour. Nice art style and music. It\\'s definitely worth the $10, especially if you can get it on special. A small, yet fast-paced game that is fun to play and takes a lot to master.\\nI would recommend this to anyone, especially those who want a challenge with the harder difficulties. A fun little game with a surprisingly interesting story, smooth and satisfying gameplay and gorgeous pixel art. Stumbled upon this gem quite by accident. Containing flavors of The Legend of Zelda, classic Metroidvania, and Dark Souls, Momodora managed to be something more than the sum of its parts. A truly excellent game that I would recommend giving a try. Fast paced, fun little metroidvania. Tight controls, tough but fair, lots of stuff to find, lots of replayability.\\n\\nalso giant woman w/ big tiddies Huh This is a really good game. The art is nice and is well designed and gives the world depth and feeling by the contrasting areas. The soundtrack is probably one of my favorite ones that I have heard. The controls are crisp and easy to pick up but offer quite a surprising amout of depth. The boss battle are all really enjoyable and can be fairly challenging. Oh, and the insane mode is actually really really hard, so that\\'s fun if you like that. The story is a bit sad, but great games tend to be. Also there are quite a few secrets. Good, simple fun game. This is a cool mix between a 2d pixel-graphics platformer and Dark Souls. The sprites are pretty cute and very well animated. This is kinda hard though, but overall pretty great. Totally recommend it. This game is a real gem.\\n\\nIt rides a line between a sort of Halloween feel and actually being morbid as you get further along. The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic, and the soundtrack nails the somber tone. (The soundtrack\\'s a huge selling point, actually. I bought it with the game, and still listen to it regularly.) The areas are diverse while still fitting the theme, and the art style is pleasant and charming.\\n\\nIn addition, it controls great. It\\'s a satisfying challenge, and the boss fights are fun.\\n\\nThough it is a shorter game, it\\'s well worth the price. And if it goes on sale, there\\'s no reason not to pick it up. Pretty. Satisfying controls. Multiple endings. Fun combat, fun upgrades. Giant tiddies. Love it! Good tight controls\\nDecent upgrades\\nToo Damn short\\n8/10 One of the best Metroidvania games ever. Insanely fun to play & crisp controls. This game is awsome! Its a tight 2d platformer with good controls an interesting setting and it very atmospheric. Its tough but fair and the music is good.  9/10 Game is kind of a short one, but was enjoyable. Momodora 4 sports what I consider at the moment the golden standard of difficulty curves. The game is engaging without never turning frustrating. The shortage of RPG-ey stat ups means enemy design relies on more than just numbers to ramp up the challenge, while still keeping the numbers in check for most playthroughs. I cannot find words to describe this game in any negative way other than, it was too short. But with the beautiful soundtrack, the modern-retro style (that might be counter intuitive), and the overall feel of it, I can\\'t help to give it anything else than a good review. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight was a great game and I would recommend it to many. (sorry if my spelling was off) Awesome game!!!\\nIt\\'s a short game, but with a good gameplay and a really charming pixel art. After finishing the game on all difficulties I have decided to update my review (nothing to do with the steam awards I swear!) Having spent 14.2 hours with this game. I am still of the opinion that is is simply an excellent metroidvania. The gameplay is fun and challenging whilst remaining fair; not once did I encounter a moment of frustration brought upon by a poor mechanic, bug or  inappropriate jump in difficulty. Again owing to the design, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight allows players to experience the game how they choose: by collecting everything, aiming for all of the achievements, a casual run just for story or even a speedrun. Complimented by beautiful graphics and a wonderfully crafted OST, the game is surely an enjoyable experience for anyone who has an interest in 2D platformers.\\n\\nPersonally I fully recommend buying this game - on sale or not - if you are looking for not just an exceptional metroidvania, but an exceptional game. Fun and challenging at times, but also fairly simple and short. It reminded me a lot of a simplified Castlevania. It\\'s the Dark Souls of video games.\\nLet me start over.\\nMomodora nails it with consistent atmosphere. There\\'s wide exploration, but you always feel like you\\'re going somewhere and making progress, so it\\'s not tedious. The combat is very simple but works, providing a good challenge without a lot of complexity. The bosses all feel unique.\\nThe bow\\'s a bit OP though. Try not to use it if you\\'re looking for a challenge.\\nIt basically takes the same points that most people like about Dark Souls, condensed into a short, tight package.\\nIt\\'s good. A very engaging adventure game with great pixelart and a unique story. Good difficulty too if you play on hard. You can find my Tl;Dr at the end of the review\\n\\nAt first glance this looks like so many other pixelated sidescrolling games which came out in the last couple of years. But what can be said about Momodora? I could talk about the nicely tuned difficulty settings and the tight controls which defintitely wont fail you, or the dark soul like story telling, where only pieces are laid before you, and it is up to you to to put the pieces of the story and the characters together to form your own picture.\\nHowever there is one thing that sets this game apart for me\\n\\nIt is the atmosphere! The world and each level itself tells a story. Each enemy is lovely crafted. The music just pulls you in and you and your character simply merge into this world. From the grass on the ground that bends when you move over it, to falling leaves, to fiery pits and underwater tunnels. There is an amazing amount of exploration to be done, and with each new location you will find another rewarding experience. \\nTake your time, explore to your hearts content, exhaust all possible dialogue options of each character and dive into the world of Momodora. \\n\\n\\nTl;Dr:\\n+Atmosphere\\n+Soundtrack\\n+Nice difficulty arrangement\\n+Story\\n+Gameplay\\n+Level Design\\n+newgame+\\n\\n-Depending on your skill and the difficulty this game will only last you 2-5 hours for the first run the only bad thing is the 4:3 ratio. This game is fantastic! It has gorgeous gothic themed pixel art, fluid controls and great soundtrack.\\nIt\\'s a shame the game is a bit short, I\\'ve finished it in less than five hours and there is little incentive to replay it.\\nIf the dev releases a DLC or sequel soon I will certainly buy it. DO YOU LIKE PLAYING THE ORIGINAL METROID TITLES? \\nHAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF CASTLEVANIA??? \\nHAVE YOU EVER WANTED DARK SOULS TO BE HARDER AND IN 2D?!?!?!\\n\\nIF ANY OF THE ABOVE APPLY THEN YOU MUST PURCHASE THIS GAME NOW!!! ACT FAST AND START WASTING YOUR LIFE PLAYING THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN 28059385 TIMES TODAY!!!!!\\n\\n10/10 would spam arrows again. 100% recommendation, even full priced.\\n\\nOne of those \"wow, i did not expect that\" games. Bought it mainly because i like pixelart and this style in particular. However, couple of hours later, this game was in equal standing with Axiom Verge, Ori and the Blind Forest and Super Metroid for me. It is a classical metroidvania, with really polished everything. Somewhat on the lighter side, smaller in terms of the world, mechanics, story. But nevertheless it\\'s a really solid game, worth every cent. If you like metroidvanias, pixelart and good music, there is no real reason not to buy it.\\n\\nPros:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Really good pixelart. Solid style in general.\\n    [*]Extremely responsive and fluid controls.\\n    [*]Not bloated, every mechanics and area feels like a completed part of the game, every item is useful.\\n    [*]Replay value (ng+, several endings, hidden boss, difficulty levels and challenging hidden mechanics).\\n    [*]Music is good and adds to the atmosphere perfectly.\\n    [*]Good dev team, every bug was patched, questionable design choices were refined.\\n[/list]\\n\\nCons:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Only con i can think of is that i want more of this. More story, different characters etc.\\n[/list] Punishing but rewarding once you learn the enemies and progress. Story is simple but enjoyable, gameplay is tight and just the right side of frustratingly difficult. This game is the absolutely charming result of what happens when Metroidvanias meet Dark Souls.\\n\\nPlay it immediately if you haven\\'t.\\n\\n11/10, would buy Momodora 5 at full price, all praise to rdein for developing such a good game. Pros: You hit things with a leaf.\\nCharacters are cute\\nMusic is REALLY GREAT.\\nAll around great levels.\\nCons: Things hit you back I can\\'t recommend this game enough! I bought it because I wanted a Metroid-Vania to play, and the game exceeded my expectations in every way. It has great gameplay, great bosses, and an awesome setting as well. The only downside is that it is a little short, with my first playthrough taking about 8 hours, but the experience I had playing this game was well worth the price. One of the best metroidvania games ever created imo, personally my favourite. Combat, atmosphere, progression are all great. Only con I can come up with would be that it could be longer with more content, but what is available is very good. The soundtrack is beautiful, the art is amazing, and the controls are just how they feel like they should be. This game was an experience, and an enjoyable one at that. I don\\'t really know what to say about this game as I am pretty bad at writing reviews, but the game movement and \"battles\"/fights felt fair and had just the right amount of skill to complete without getting hit. Got it during sale and the value I got from it at least for me was really worth and made me really look for possible sequel for Momodora and if such sequel ever comes out, I will most likely get it as soon as I can. Basics:\\nPlatformer, Action, Adventure\\nThese 3 aspects of a game can make a great metroidvania.\\nMaybe a little bit shorter of a game but definetely worth the base price.\\nThe soundtrack is cool too.\\nThe combat in the game is fun even though it\\'s somewhat limited. Great little game. Really enjoyed it. Very atmospheric and challenging platformer. Worth every cent! This game scratches the Metroidvania itch perfectly along with beautiful pixel art and silky smooth animations. challenging, beautiful art, good gameplay and a fine story. an amazing game. Hey there! I want to tell you something.\\nThis game\\xa0is magnificent! \\nI were\\xa0in a\\xa0wonderful journey through the cursed melancholic world.\\xa0World full of secrets and mysteries, interesting characters and dangerous creatures.\\xa0You can\\xa0feel that this world lives. Management and animation on top! Wonderfully drawn monsters and bosses (I really love pixel art in this game, (*___*) so beautiful).\\nAnd you know...i just don\\'t want to end this journey. A lonely girl. Lots of small things you\\'re going to want to avoid killing at least for one run. A few big things that you\\'re going to want very dead after their assault on you leaves you dead and cursing their existence.\\n\\nOverall, a properly priced \"git gud\" \\'vania that one returns to once in a while to revisit the gorgeous world contained within with one of the smoother soundtracks out there. Very fun A great metroidvania inspired game, beautiful art and good soundtrack. The only problem is that it\\'s about 5 hours long, but it\\'s still a good purchase and a great experience. This game is charming. The sprites are very well done while being accented by the level design and subtle sound track. This is a title that may start off slow for you, but once you get the game going you will find yourself playing it till finish. And that may be the only knock against it. You could beat the game in about 6 to 7 hours if you choose to mess around with secrets. Even with that, this game is worth picking up and playing. It is a true Gem of the \"Metriodvania\" genre. This game is a wonderful metroidvania game with a couple of souls like elements.  The story is very minimal, but gives enough to build a great world and gives enough info for a plot to move the game forward.  Gameplay is a bit slow almost like a souls game, but the inputs are accurate and I never felt like the controls hindered me or got me killed.  The game also has varying difficuties that allow for both the casual and hardcore to enjoy this game. The best in the series by far.  You don\\'t need to play the others if you want to jump right in.\\n\\nMomodora:  Reverie Under the Moonlight is an action platformer that tells a story with minimal dialog and sets a great mood no matter what zone you\\'re in.  You play as Kaho, a preistess armed with a blessed leaf (melee) and a bow (ranged).  This dynamic in fighting style makes the game have a great feel, especially coupled with the dodge-roll mechanic.  All consumable items (healing bellflowers and attack buffs) can be recharged at the save bell where you are also healed, making it have a somewhat souls-game feel.\\n\\nOverall, a highly recommended game especially if you like cute girls kicking ass! Solid gameplay, great artwork and ambience.   It is fairly short, but I liked it enough to run through it multiple time to get all the achievements. Great story, great atmosphere, nice range in difficulty, solid gameplay. It\\'s old school game that made me think of \"Castlevania\"\\nGameplay : Old school castlevanis style with going 2D sideway,collecting power up and buy more item,sadly I want something more like skills but it isn\\'t here but still it\\'s solid castlevania style that has smart level design to make you die for sometime if you\\'re not used to controller like me.\\nGraphic : I like it as I do love sprite game but that might because I\\'m old enough to experienced 8 bit game so graphic isn\\'t something that turn me of as animation of attack is good.\\nControl : I was playing with keyboard and I have problem about jumping as I normally press S (some game made me got used to press A attack and S as jump)kinda make me mad a bit and I don\\'t know how to change the layout button,\\nConclusion : it\\'s solid old school game that deserve a praise and it\\'s pretty cheap but I would like to have more character to play as alternative. Cute but melancholic little metrodvania game with Dark Souls elements (atmosphere, bosses, bonfire, estus system and dodge roll). If you like any of the above stuff, then pick up this game by all means. \\n\\nAlso, try to perfect the bosses if you can. You\\'ll be rewarded by an item. 10/10 would 100% again.\\n\\nControls are absolutely perfect, visuals and music are amazing, easily worth the price! love it This isn\\'t just a game. It\\'s gorgeous work of art, flowing with magic and giant witch boobies. If you like Metroidvania or Dark Souls, you should buy Momodora. You will get your ass handed to you repeatedly. You will die, and die, and sometimes you might even scream \"ARRRRGH ARRRRRR AHHHH FUUUUU KRNGVEGVOEIIJ!\"\\n\\nThe game is very pretty, has a good sound track, and is hard without being impossible. I suck at most single player games, mostly because I play them all on Hard difficulty thinking I\\'m cool, but really that just means I die 100x more than I need to. But, in this case, after dying 100 times I figured out some neat little tricks to the game and eventually got to the end. 5/7 will play through again. Great game. Tight controls and great art. Only complaint is the game is very short, roughly 3.5hours. Had no expectations when I grabbed this on a whim but I was really pleasantly surprised. I think the length and amount of content in the game is really quite perfect, and the entire game feels very concise. I never expected myself to finish a game I bought on steam so soon after I got it. Highly recommended. Solid Metroidvania game. If you like 2D platformers this is worth playing. great game Great game. Plays and sounds amazing. A solid little Metroidvania that can last about 5 hours going into it blind if you spend some time trying to find everything. \\n\\nThe only complaint I had was the second jump on the double-jump felt a little weak and I would occasionally miss platforms I was aiming for. If that had just a few pixels more lift, it\\'d be perfect. gr8 g8m Solid game in the vein of Megaman Zero. \\nGood visual design goes a long way here. \\nThe hardest difficulty is recommended. One of the best Metroid-vania games I\\'ve played and a great blend of both the exploration and combat that come from the games that give the genre it\\'s namesake. It is responsive, fluid and has just enough to explore without feeling overbearing. I really enjoyed my time with Momodora and it is one of my favourite games played this year. Also the soundtrack and pixelart are absolutely delightful. If you\\'re a fan of 2d action platformers it\\'s a no brainer, pick this up.\\n\\nPros:\\n-> Fantastic pixel art\\n-> Great music\\n-> Solid game play\\n\\nCons:\\n-> There\\'s not enough of it. I actually beat the final boss without even realizing it was the final boss until it asked if I\\'d like to start new game plus. It felt a bit cut-off\\n-> In-line with the above con I really would have liked some more interaction/closure with some of the side characters.\\n\\nFantastic game. I\\'m a little sad that I feel some of the potential was never realized, but overall it\\'s very solid. 1st time completion on normal took about 8 hours.   Momodora is a cute, fantastic and addicting adventure. The story itself isn\\'t really deep, and I would have loved if we could learn just a little bit more about each character, but everything still plays out perfectly. The gameplay itself is addictive and I really, really, really adore it. The \"regular monsters\" are easy, but not \"boring easy\", they\\'re slighlty challenging (they are not dumb), just as they are supposed to be. Literally everything about Momodora is just so... \"smooth\", I guess. The graphics, the gameplay, the story. \\n  This is the kind of game that makes me feel at home. Momodora: RUTM is for anybody who enjoys deep action-adventure oriented 2d sidescrolling platformers. It\\'s a lovely mixed bag of what shmups, beat em ups and metroidvanias have to offer. \\n\\nGameplay is solid, straight-forward but complex, and thanks to the ability to dodge on the ground (and later in the air), use a bow and arrow and your leaf melee weapon allows you flexibility to a little varied on how you tackle enemies. It has your typical Metroidvania layout and will please explorers who want a great sense of atmosphere and completionists who want to 100% the game by letting them searching every nook and cranny for upgrades. The art and aesthetic are fantastic, you really get into the world this game paints (reminds me of Super Metroid in the respect of how great its atmosphere is). Music is ominous and beautiful; great soundtrack!\\n\\nIt\\'s crazy to see how far this game has evolved from the previous Momodora games, where it had its humble roots as a solid Cave Story/Touhou-inspired game series with unique twists to something that really is its own. If you\\'re into games like Shovel Knight, Hyper Light Drifter, Metroid, Megaman, then check this out; it\\'s a pretty cheap game for a great experience. This may be one of the best games I have played all year. It is kind of like Metroid meets Dark Souls (on hard/insane difficulty at least) if you are in to that kind of thing, both in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. It is Art that is not so far gone into its own cleverness that it loses out on what games are supposed to be. Lovely spritework\\nAmazing atmosphere\\nFantastic music\\nResponsive controlls\\nWell hidden lore\\nVaried enemies\\nGood bossfights\\n\\nWhat\\'s not to like? True metroidvania, unlike some other titles that are listed as such just because they\\'re sidescrollers. I\\'m a big fan of Dex, Ghost 1.0 and Unepic, but they aren\\'t really metroidvania in terms of unlocking new areas via items, mulitiple path open world, backtracking.\\n\\nIt\\'s listed as difficult, I don\\'t think it really is except for the fact that you don\\'t have many hit points. But all the bosses, while they can wipe you out in two or three hits, have predictable patterns. Case in point, on insane difficulty everything is a one hit kill, and many players (not me) have finished the game on that setting.\\n\\nAnd when I say it isn\\'t particularly difficult that\\'s coming from someone who didn\\'t care for Dark Souls, and didn\\'t finish the demo version of Wings of Vi.\\n\\nIt is a bit short, but it\\'s about par with games of it\\'s kind and price tag.\\n\\nCorrection: it\\'s at the head of its class in terms of similar games.\\n\\nVery engaging gameplay, challenging but fair bosses, great exploration. I love it.\\n\\nAlso cats.\\n\\nI\\'m in love with this game. It\\'s where Dex and I spent our honeymoon. This game is great.\\nGood things about the game:\\n+Beautiful graphics\\n+Vague but understandable story\\n+Very rewarding and solid mechanics in combat and movement\\n+Great music\\n+Great world and charicter design\\n+Great map organisation for a metroidvania\\n+Secrets are actually secret\\n+Load outs can be varient between defense, exploring, or offence\\n+Not a serious collectithon like other games\\n\\nThings that could be better:\\n-Lack of VSYNC option\\n-Game was a bit short\\n-Locked in 4:3 aspect ratio\\n-Normal diffaculty was a bit too easy\\n\\nOver all if you like metroidvania\\'s and enjoy the world and gameplay design of Darksouls then this is a great pickup I rarely enjoy indie games. But this one got me hooked right from the start. Not only have they put time and effort into the animations and game mechanics, but also into the story. The story is told through the game itself not by reading a long paragraph of words. Not that I dislike games that have these long paragraphs, but it adds a sense of realism to the game world when the story is told through what you see, not what you read. \\n\\nThe dialogue is also pretty good. no cave story or super metroid, but it scrathes the metroidvania itch.\\n7/10. Awesome Metroidvania-style game. I really recommend if your kinda bad at these, cause it\\'s a really nice introduction to the genre. Finding secrets are about the best part of the game! I highly suggest. short but sweet chibi metroidvania fun. The biggest drawback to this game is it is too short. It can be beaten in four hours by someone who has no idea what they\\'re doing (me).\\n\\nAll kidding aside, this game is like a cuter guacamelee. If you think that sounds fun, then this game is for you. most games are rly shit but this one is ok Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a execellent 2D Style game with pixel graphics. Personally I would recommend the game for you if you like action, pixelated and intense moments so on...\\n\\nWhat I liked about the game : \\nReally personally I liked everything, the fact that you can explore everywhere you can (Atleast at the places it doesn\\'t restrict you! Of course, edge of the game) the combat-style was well very good didn\\'t feel like a cheap mash you had to time your attacks or get countered, interesting story too that you puzzle together yourself. \\n\\nMinor thing I disliked :\\nThe fact that, you can actually get stuck at certain points of the game confused where you are sometimes. Even losted because most of the map is like a giant maze, restrictions to areas (Need to discover keys, etc.) so it gets annoying when you back-track because you missed a key or something like that (This happened to me alot D:) \\n\\nBUT except from that, it was a execellent game. Thank you for reading! :D I sold my Stattrak Tec-9 Issac Factory New for 15 dollars, and I bought this game withought much thought about it. It looked good, that\\'s all the incentive I needed. What I didn\\'t expect, however, was to find that this is one of my most favorite games I have ever played in my life. Everything is great, from the art and music, to the gameplay and story. This game is like a 2D Dark Souls in terms of gameplay, featuring rolling, bosses, save/warp points akin to bonfires, dying,  backtracking, difficulty, and dying. At the begining of this game, you\\'ll be a bad player that dies a lot. And at the end of it, you\\'ll be a good player that dies a lot. Some enemies from the begining areas of the game can take off big chunks of your health if you aren\\'t paying attention. The bosses are even worse than the rest of the fray, most taking me multiple tries to beat them. This game isn\\'t hard to the point of dissatisfaction, however. Killing monsters and progressing forwards feels good, and makes you interested in what fate our little redhead priestess finds at the end of her journey. That is, if you can even get her there.\\n\\nWIsh me luck beating this on insane difficulty. Feels like Metroid Zero Mission but with a better atmosphere i think. It  also has an easy mode which i personally love because i play games to relax, not to get frustrated. Ad in a female protagonist and i\\'m sold! amazing gameplay, good soundtrack, beautiful animated graphics, this game can be both enjoyful and challenging.\\nPlus multiple languages supported, these are the reasons why I recommend this game.\\nIt\\'s awesome, but wish it could be longer. A fantastic metroidvania, really wish the game was a lot longer Highly recommend it. Played it on hard. Did not regret. Awesome game!  Sweet, short, bloodborne meets castlevania aesthetic that was a blast to play.  The music and backgrounds are fantastic.  The action is tight and the platforming is fun.  Nice secrets and item progression to help fight challenging bosses.  Fans of metroidvania games will not be dissapointed. I\\'m giving this a YES PLEASE! with a side of wanting more. This is a really great game with a ton of replay value. Even after beating the game for the first time I felt like there was a lot I could still accomplish and I can\\'t wait to see what new game+ has to offer. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a charming Metroidvania that is a satisfying experience in every possible way. The visuals are really well done and at some points breathtaking. Boss battles are challenging but not frustratingly difficult. The musical score? Gorgeous. Controls? Fluid. Map? Easy to understand and has a percent counter to tell you about how much you have yet to explore. Secrets are well hidden but not impossible to find for those with a keen eye. And the story, while minimal, prefers to show you what\\'s happening through its world instead of lengthy text, though there are a number of characters you start to feel for as the game progresses. Everything just works. And while the game isn\\'t too long, other difficulties and new game plus extend the length of the game. And this is the fourth game in the series! So if you\\'re craving more Momodora the first two are free and the third is only a couple dollars. I highly recommend. Cool. It\\'s a pretty good metroidvania game that has a great look and solid soundtrack. I want to start off by saying I\\'m not a fan of 2D platformer games, however Momodora is an incredible game and the first one I\\'ve played from the series.\\nFrom the get go, the combat is satisfying. Inspired by Dark Souls and pulled off with a mix of beautiful animations, screen shake, well crafted enemies and interesting bosses. All of which are rewarding to defeat.\\n\\nTo go along with the amazing gameplay, my favourite thing would have to be the atmosphere.\\nThe world is brought to life through its beautiful acoustic music, the expert use of colour palettes in each area and dialogue which is spread very thin, but every phrase spoken leaves a strong impact.\\n\\nYou\\'re looking at a short but replayable, very well polished game that is definitely worth the cost. I\\'d highly reccomend buying it while the sale lasts! Alright, looking back on my old review, and it kinda sucked. However I still REALLY like this game. It was a joy to play. It\\'s not a very big metroidvania game, but what is there is pretty polish in my opinion. All the bosses are unique, the areas you go through look interesting, the gameplay is fun, and the characters are interesting. Good all around game, fun to play, good pacing, beautiful graphics with ambient music and sound effects.  The game can best be described as Shante meets Darksouls.  Only complaint is it doesn\\'t work on fullscreen on my computer, but I have some weird screen size on my laptop that isn\\'t compadible with lots of things, I forget the exact dimensions but it is a pain in the ass.  Anyway, this is a solid game I would reccomend picking up, especially if it\\'s on sale. 10/10, amazing soundtrack, tight controls, beautiful graphics, challenging. The best game I have played in years. Great gameplay. Interesting story. Immersion to the max. Bosses better than Dark Souls(mostly). Soundtrack is God-tier. And the pixel art is pretty good.\\n\\n10/10 would hit people with a leaf again The cutest priestess with a meple leaf  \\n Great side scrolling action/rpg.  Lots of souls inspiration via clones of bonfires, eventually warping between bonfires, tough enemies, dodge rolling, very tough boses, estus health pots that refill at bonfires, etc.  The controls are tight and the exploration is fun without becoming tedius.  The graphics are pretty while maintaing nostalgia.  Very light/hidden on story like souls as well.  Very fun adventure. Had a lot of fun playing this. no problems what so ever. Nothing really needed to be changed. For 7$ this game is amazing; it has a little of megaman zero, dark souls, and castlevania in it. 갓 - 하드게임 Feels a bit like indie Souls. Beautiful artstyle fluid movement, great combat. The only thing that\\'s a bit of a shame is that the story could be more fleshed out. Other than that the game is really really good. This game oozes a Dark Souls mood. A dark and sinister city in front of an abandoned and decaying Castlevania-like castle.\\nYou immerse in this dull and frightening environment. The music and sounds are very well performed, so that most of the time I felt the uncomfortable horror this game radiates. \\n\\n- 2D Platformer with open world, collectible (secret) items hidden everywhere, backtracking of map (Metroidvania)\\n- Difficulty rises throughout the game from too easy to harder than casual games, though on hard mode still easier than Mega Man. \\n[quote][u]Difficulty Scale[/u]\\n[olist][*][i]IWBTG[/i]\\n[*][i]Super Meat Boy[/i]\\n[*][i]Mega Man[/i]\\n[*][u][url]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/url][/u]\\n[*][i]Super Mario Bros.[/i][/olist][/quote]\\n\\nOnce you know the attack patterns of your enemy it\\'s almost a peace of cake. The thing in this game what makes it hard, and that is a negative point, is that you have to repeat long ways after dying to get this knowledge, which can be a chore. Once known it is not that hard to perform the required task. Another negative point are the elevators, which cannot be exited once unintendedly started. Then you have to wait the whole way down and up again.\\n\\nBut I enjoyed this game! It is very immersive and rewarding with many hidden secrets to discover! \\nI can recommend this game to everyone who likes a dark mood à la Dark Souls mixed with decent 2D Platforming and japanese anime pixel graphics. Great game!  2D sidescroller in the style of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.  Definitely scratched my platformer itch. :)  Thanks to Playism/Bombservice. Criminally short and way too simple. Map is incredibly tiny and exploration is very underwhelming. Combat is dull and repetitive. Nothing about this game is rewarding. Metroidvania fans should not buy into the hype. Just a delight to play- from graphics, to controls, to playability- it has really exceeded my expectations. A great female protagonist and an almost all female cast, and it\\'s done so well. I really enjoyed it.\\n\\nBut some suggestions for improvement: I wish it had was a more detailed map- it\\'s unfortunate that the only thing that gets marked on the map is save points when there are so many things to keep track of. Also, doing what it takes to get the good ending seems kind of arbitrary, I still don\\'t understand why I had to do what I did, and even so, both endings are really rather abrupt and weak. I would love to see another Momodora game in this style, expanded upon and improved, because this game does so much right. This is my pick for hidden gem of the year.\\n\\nJust to drive home my feelings on this game- I started playing Rise of the Tomb Raider before this game. Then I got this game and was just going to check it out for a bit before going back to Tomb Raider- to my surprise I found I couldn\\'t go back to Tomb Raider until I finished Momodora. In other words, I actually found Momodora RUTM more fun and interesting than the newest Tomb Raider game. 最近也开始关注些像素画及像素风，于是就在商店看到了它。人物都很可爱，不管是色调和音乐还有氛围都很不错，至于经常手贱花样作死那就另当别论了。 Momodora: Reverie is a little bit action platformer, a little bit metroidvania, all atmosphere. As the adorable plucky priestess, Kaho, Players slash and explore their way through a seemlessly interlinked city of darkness, surviving from checkpoint to checkpoint.\\n\\nDrawing influence from the venerable Dark Souls franchise, Reverie is a bit more tight and action packed than the Castlevania titles that most gamers thoughts turn to when the subject of sidescrolling exploration is brought up. Checkpoints are carefully placed amongst challenging trap and combat entrenched gauntlets, and while there is room for exploration amonst its many alternate paths, Reverie slants itself towards brisk progression with a smaller and simpler world map.\\n\\nThe labyrinthine world, magic powers acquired, and enemy and boss design are solid, if perhaps nothing truly oustanding. But Reverie\\'s faster pace and greater emphasis on platforming give it a definite edge over its predecessors in the genre, in my opinion. Gracefully flowing through the periolous obstacle courses of Reverie\\'s dungeons (as opposed to SOTN and its sequels \"rectangular room full of enemies\" level design) with Kaho\\'s smooth movement controls is both fun and intense. And the pace and length of the game is suited well to arcade-y single sitting speed runs, making replays and challenge runs more exciting and more approachable.\\n\\nThe real star of the show, however, is the atmosphere. The Dark Souls (and spiritual sister title, Bloodborne) series influence doesn\\'t stop at the gameplay elements. Reverie\\'s world is similarly bleak, haunted, and brutal. What really makes Reverie unique however, is its whimsy. The juxtaposition of cutesie fantasy character and monster designs with a plot that loves to tragically murder them creates an oldschool violent-fairytale vibe. At once lovably kooky, and morbidly bittersweet, Kaho\\'s lonely journey is one worth taking.\\n\\n100% fun, and for a purchase made on a whim to test a new credit card, I was not expecting its world to hit me as much as it did. Quite honestly, if the upcoming SOTN spiritual sequel, Bloodstained manages to be half as good as this charming little title. I\\'ll be genuinely surprised. Very much recommended. Pros:\\n+ Good World Building and Atmosphere - Art style and characters\\n+ Controls are great each attack has an \"umph\" to it. Probably as it follows similar philosphies as dark souls in its combat\\n+ Game is a good length does not over stay it welcome. First run starts at about 4-6 hours , the rest can be enjoyed in 30 minut to one hour session\\n+ Game is challenging in a good way where mistakes are made by you and can be overcome simply by a little hand guiding and learning\\n+ On going updates and great community, speedruns included -love half coordinated videos\\nCons:\\n- Story left me disappointed.....[spoiler]the cat[/spoiler]... \\n- Wish this game was on linux... oh well one can dream What a delightful game! Beautiful animation, challenging boss-fights, and a mysterious and bittersweet world to explore. I enjoyed every minute of it. Very well designed old-fashioned action RPG. I especially like the fact that little instructions were given to the players and much is left for us to learn by ourselves. Though I do think that the \\'magic\\'s for this game are not as interesting because they fuction only as a clue to solving puzzles in maps rather than helping with the playthrough itself. \\nHighly recommended for someone who like old-fashioned hard core RPG and wants some pixel cute girl who wields a maple leaf as your heroin. This is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack, tons of atmosphere, and a great retro vibe. I definitely recommend it if you like Metroid-style games.\\n\\nHowever, the difficulty is inconsistent and overall imbalanced, and that, unfortunately, is my biggest take-away from this game and what I am going to talk about the most.\\nEnemies hit hard and often quickly, and you will end up replaying segments of the game repeatedly until you have gotten good enough at each room to reach the next save point. That\\'s basically the flow of this game, trying to survive between save points.\\n\\nThat in and of itself isn\\'t bad, but the game presents you with a health bar that looks generous but is anything but. At the very beginning of the game already you will take what visually appears to be massive damage, dying in three or four hits to the most mundane of enemies. Relative health isn\\'t really a fair point to complain about, perhaps, but it LOOKS like so much more than it is, especially when each upgrade is miniscule to the point of being almost imperceptible.\\nThe second boss is literally capable of killing you in two hits, even with every health upgrade to that point, and she employs a move that\\'s lightning quick and very difficult to dodge. The fight immediately before her involves a randomly moving enemy who telegraphs WHEN he\\'s going to attack but not HOW so it\\'s incredibly easy to get trapped behind an expanding, insanely strong attack that you have no way to get past.\\nIt\\'s enough to get frustrated very quickly.\\n\\nEasy mode, rather than just having the enemies deal less damage, starts you off with all of the health upgrades, robbing the game of much of the fun of searching for things.\\n\\nHow enjoyable the difficulty of a game is, is of course subjective. If you want a gorgeous game that\\'s old-school in both its appearance and its challenge factor, this game is for you. For me, however, at the end of the day, I have enough Metroidvanias to choose from that have more balanced difficulty and don\\'t often punish you severly for a single error that I don\\'t see myself bothering to finish this game. Momodora is a castlevania/metroid-type of game, where you go around places searching for items and power ups. The game is quite short, but its good for doing multiple runs. Unless you don\\'t like doing those, then the game might not offer you much.\\n\\nThe weapons are fun to use. The Leaf Sword and Bow are really familiar to Megaman Zero series\\' Z-saber and Z-buster. Leaf Sword deals nice sum of damage and its fast. You can perform a 3 hit combo with it. And the bow hits from the distance and has a charge ability! MMZ is one of my favorites because of the combat feels good. And this game is no different.\\n\\nI completed the game on hard mode right away, so I can\\'t really say how hard the normal mode is. All I can say about hard mode is that prepare for one shot deaths. It\\'s not too hard, but some of the bosses might be annoying because they have a lot of attacks that can one shot you. So if you want to get into the combat system and how the enemies play, I recommend the normal difficult. \\n \\nI\\'ve been looking for a game like this, but I wish this one would be longer and had a bit more bosses. It kinda got me hooked and made me want more. I really want a Metroidvania game with Megaman Zero combat. \\n\\nGood game, though. Maybe I would still suggest for a discount first before buying. Bought this game during a sale for $6.99. After playing, I would have definitely paid the original $9.99 price tag. Fun and rewarding metroidvania style game with a little bit of Dark Souls thrown in. For example, a checkpoint save system (think bonfire) that refills your health and useable items while also saving your game. Beautiful art direction in both sound and visuals. I would put the soundtrack in the top 3 for best I have heard in the past year. I only wish it was a longer game. My playtime says 6 hours but I finished in about 5. That other hour was taking breaks and what not (I actually played the game straight through in one shot). Would definitely recommend if you are into metroidvania games. This game is an excellent example of environmental story telling. You\\'re given the bare minimum and figuring out exactly what happened is mostly up to you.\\n\\nI loved the visuals and while the music does the tone of the game a great service, I didn\\'t find much of it memorable until the very end.\\n\\nShort but bitter sweet, if you like the 2D metroidvania genre just pick this one up, its worth it. Like a 2d Souls game\\n\\n\\nThis game kicks my ass, 10/10 this game is awesome I am not very fond of the fighting elements, very short attack distance and very unforgiving. The roll mechanic just seems to roll you right into enimies and cause you damage. This happens constantly, lots of frustrating deaths.  I am always looking for a good metroidvania but this game didn\\'t scratch the itch for me, inspite of the fact that everyone else seems to really like it. The best out of the Momodora games It\\'s cute, but also good. Gameplay is smooth, music is amazing and the artstyle is pleasant.\\n\\nGet it. Beautiful design, tight controls, fun bosses, good platforming, and a tremendously dark and evocative atmosphere. Loving it. It\\'s a bit like a cutsy, 2D version of Dark Souls, right down to the gloomy atmosphere.\\n\\nFun game. Good, responsive controls. You can probably finish it in 4 or 5 hours - more if you intende to find every secret. This game is so good that I\\'m taking a break for posting reviews only for waifu games and NEEDING to support this title. For fans of the soulsborne and metroidvania series, this game is amazing. My only negative feedback is that I wanted more of the game by the time it was done. \\n\\nControls are tight, pacing is well done. Difficulty is challenging yet fair (normal and hard perspective) . The atmosphere of the game so well conveyed through such minimal elements. I genuinely cared about certain events that happened despite having such limited interaction with them. It was a compressed experience of playing Dark Souls for the first time, which I would consider the greatest game ever made. While the game is pretty short (100% completion of the map + good ending in 4 hrs 16 mins), the game itself is excellent, and with the price it\\'s at it\\'s definitely worth the money.\\n\\nThe combat is fun and the soundtrack is really good too. I got a bit of a Souls/Bloodborne vibe from the tone (one boss especially).\\n\\nDefinitely would recommend it. This game is great! Bought it on a small sale and couldn\\'t put it down until I beat it. The game took roughly 5 hours to beat, but it\\'s also inexpensive and has NG+. Keyboard controls are okay, but a controller is much nicer in my opinion. Definitely would recommend for any fan of Castlevania, Metroid, or Megaman. This game was well worth the money I spent on it, which is 7 dollars as of a recent sale.\\n\\nThe gameplay itself is remarkably smooth, though one has to get used to the control scheme a bit. No big issue there; once you master it, it becomes as easy as breathing.\\n\\nThe graphics are amazing despite being so scaled down, with every character feeling alive and unique instead of being stiff entities.\\n\\nThe music, while not exactly memorable on my end, is perfect for the game. Calm, atmospheric, but intense when it needs to be and doesn\\'t overtake the sound effects. Even when I had to re-fight several bosses, I still loved the music.\\n\\nAll in all, it is a greatly enjoyable experience for those that like something a bit more difficult than your average video game. \\n\\nIf I had to give it a number score, I\\'d give it a 9.1/10. Challenging, beautiful, and fun. What more could you ask for? Really cool game to play, graphics are amazing, and it gives me a challange to beat every level. Definetly worth it. Feels good to play, sprite work is nice to look at (by that I mean it\\'s really good), and the cat is adorable. Not as hard as some make it out to be, but there are definitely some challenging sections, including some bosses. This game is down-right beautiful. Definitely one of the best of the metroid-vania genre, to my knowledge. Simple/challenging. Art is fantasmo. HIDDEN STUFF. All in all, great game.\\n\\n(Pssst! Would also make a super bombtastic H-Game)\\n\\nJust so you dev folk are aware..haha Overall one of the better metroidvanias out there. My only complaint is that, except for one boss, it\\'s too easy, especially because common enemies take way too long to attack and spamming attacks automatically stun them. If you are fast and good enough you can complete the game without ever seeing some enemies attack animation. 10/10, although I was disappointed with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I will just say this: I reloaded my save looking through the entire map looking for something I should have collected or something I wanted to find to get an alternative ending.\\n\\nI ragequitted when I discovered there was no such thing, and that I actually experienced the true ending. RIP my character.\\n\\nNever send a leaf to do steels job.\\n\\nEDIT: Woah woah, ok there IS an alternative ending. Shit fuck idk how to get it. Ever since I played the Castlevania games on PS1, GBA and DS I\\'ve craved the platforming map discovery genre known as \"metroidvania,\" and this game very much satisfied the craving.\\nThe only downfall to this game is the fairly short story and lack of content. I would be delighted to see some DLC for this game such as new areas, bosses and playable characters. Nice little game, I felt it was worth the price especially if you plan to 100% everything. Was loving this game up until the battery in my controller died and after I replaced the battery with a freshly charged one it wouldn\\'t pick up the controller again.  Keyboard input worked, but wouldn\\'t let me get to the menu and change back to the controller.  With as unforgiving as this game is, it needs to be able to pick the controller input up right away if this happens. I liked it. Not bad, but not good.  Would rather have my money back. The atmosphere IS the story.\\n\\nYou\\'re fighting to save the world from corruption, and it\\'s like the world actually has a persona.\\n\\nIt\\'s awesome.\\n\\n If you like metroidvanias, you willl enjoy this game.\\n\\n The gameplay is short and sweet, lasting roughly 7-8 hours for one playthrough.   The game has an amazing diversity of unique enemies and areas, with a great soundtrack to tie it all together.  The platforming is solid, and bosses offer a pretty fair challenge.  The story isn\\'t the main focus of the game, but for an 8 hour game it\\'s intriguing enough.   \\n\\n\\nI\\'d easily recommend to anyone who enjoys metroidvanias, it was a very satisfying 8 hours.  I\\'ll easily come back to it in a few months to beat it again.  \\n This game is fucking incredibly good. I can\\'t possibly recommend it enough. It feels and plays amazing and it\\'s gorgeous. Play it. This game brings back all the classic gameplay i used to love as a child and even more gameplay mechanics such as dodging that i enjoy in modern games. it reminds me of studio ghibli with it\\'s characters and castlevania with the gameplay,\\n\\nThis game is worth buying if you love 2D action platformers. It\\'s a good game. Didn\\'t really expect much when I bought it on sale, but I was impressed when I started playing it.\\n\\nPROS\\n-amazing gameplay\\n-great soundtrack\\n-can be pretty challenging\\n-good boss fights\\n\\nCONS\\n-it\\'s pretty short, wished it was longer The classic style of 2D platformers like Castlevania and Metriod, with some modern inspiration from games like Dark Souls. A very well done game. This is the 4th entry in the Momodora series, but it is most definitely the best. The new visual style and design choices are truly top notch. Bombservice has taken the series in a direction that I believe will spell out some great success, and I can\\'t wait to see what else they have planned for the future. ok bloodborne meets castlevania I really adored this game, for fans of platformers (namely, Metroidvania), it\\'s a must-have. I was surprised when I realized that the main content can be completed in about 5-6 hours, because it felt like a large, rich experience. Not that it\\'s the paragon of all platformers never to be topped again, but everything about it seems to be focussed on the player\\'s enjoyment. Beautiful, smooth graphics with dramatic scene reveals, a good deal of different monster patterns to learn, surprises, secrets, and multiple endings... it\\'s a good time! I would find myself drifting off at work wanting to get back into playing it.\\n\\nAs someone who seeks out challenging Metroidvanias for a good time, I\\'d say this is a 5/10 on the difficulty scale. Not only is it small enough that you don\\'t have to write notes to figure out where to backtrack, but once you get used to the controls, it becomes very intutitive. Even if you are aren\\'t a pixel-perfect expert, you\\'ll be able to handle the bosses once you learn their moves. There are challenges like no death, pacifist, or special rewards for taking no damage in the boss battles, so seasoned MV players shouldn\\'t pass it up either. Don\\'t expect much story, but the real MVP is the gameplay. It feels fun to play, and I really look forward to seeing more from this developer. Loved it! Pretty hard, but lots of fun toys and an engaging set of enemies to learn. And a good metroidvania world to poke around in.\\n\\nWish it was a little longer, but I guess that\\'s the way the best games leave you feeling. This game\\'s pretty great. It feels a bit short but it\\'s well-executed. Check out @halfcoordinated\\'s speedruns if you\\'re interested in how it plays. They dont make em like this anymore, hihghly reccomend for anyone a fan of the side scroller genre. perfect difficulty of challenging, yet fair. Pixelated Dark Souls. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game I can highly recommend to anyone that likes a Metroidvania.  The gameplay feels a little like classic castlevania since your primary weapon has a delay coming out and ending so you can\\'t madly slash at everything without consideration.  You get a dodgeroll that is pretty useful and cancels the ending of your attack animations.  The bow is insanely useful once you\\'ve gotten enough practice with it and enough of the abilities this weapon becomes a tool of mass destruction since it\\'s so fast and the damage output is pretty good.  You can jump while firing your bow so you can stay mobile while dishing out any damage whether you\\'re running from an opponent or chasing one down.  The level layout of the game is pretty good.  Each area is accessible to you after you\\'ve come to a certain point in the game and from there you can change your route to however you please with the exception of the garden.  You cannot enter the garden without doing the lower route at all.  The music is catchy, but I didn\\'t find it too memorable.  The actual level structure is okay.  There were a few times where I found that an enemy was placed in a position where it wouldn\\'t be convenient at all to try to kill the enemy without having to swirve around with the bow mid-air, but that\\'s what adds the challenge to it.  I do like the cameo of the Momodora theme song from one of the past games.  Aesthetically I think this game looks amazing.  For what it seeks to do with the graphical style is gorgeous.  You can tell what everything is suppose to be and even as sprites all the enemies and npc(s) emote enough so you can tell if someone is sad, angry, or whatever they are doing.  Overall, I think this game is pretty good.  I 100% this game feeling satisfied.  It left me with nice gameplay that rewards you for really getting the mechanics of the game down vs. just mindlessly destroying everything.  The music added to the atmosphere, but I felt like the music could have used a bit of touching up.  The aesthitics of this game are fantastic it was not what I was expecting from this style of game. This was a game a randomly found while scrolling through Steam. The visuals of the trailer caught my eye and honestly, they put so much polish into the visuals that I would just take time running around in the grass. While dodging mechanics aren\\'t often my thing (by that I mean I usually struggle with them), once I started using the dodge, it became such a fluid second nature. Because of that, the boss battles didn\\'t just feel like fighting a strong foe, they felt like I was literally dueling them, making them tough enough that I needed to learn their tactics, but never so difficult it felt impossible. This is something that is not only rare for me, but even made me so excited to seek out another boss. \\n\\nAs an aside, if you have a good controller, I would recommend using it. The keyboard works fine, but it did take about fifteen minutes to find a control scheme that felt smooth enough, something that I believe a controller might streamline. I enjoyed this game more than I expected to.  The combat  has alot  of weight to it,  The game was pretty challenging, but not annoying or cheap.   2d platformers are a dime a dozen on steam but this is one i\\'d definately worth a try. Pretty good and cute A very good action platformer, if a little light on story. While there are other games in the series, you do not have to play the other ones before. What an excellent game! Playing on Hard definitely made the experience much more worthwhile, enjoyable, and longer (it took me 7 hours to nearly 100% the game my first time through). I am deeply grateful for the developers and to everyone else who worked on, and was involved with, this game. Thank you. I just recently finished the game with 100% map completion and collectables and after this I can say that it was worth the time spent to do it. The atmosphere in the game is amazing as it gives off a very desolate vibe, like you are truly alone in the world exept for some occasional freindly faces which help to brighten your spirits before you are inevitably killed by the monsters that enhabit the world. One complaint that I do have is that there is a lack in enemy variety, with most of the monsters being reused in multipe areas and the ones that are unique to specific areas not feeling very special. In contrast to this, each of the bosses feel very unique and are an enjoyable challange while they last. My favourite boss was pardoner fennel as the boss theme was outstanding and the sword animations pleasant to the eye. In conclusion Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an amazing atmospheric semi-metroidvania game with great boss battles and generally fun gameplay. this quenched my dark souls thirst ... \\n\\nhas awesome bosses\\nhas i-frames\\nhas replenishable heals\\nhas triggerable checkpoints\\nhas decent enemy design\\nis kinda gritty\\n\\nrun it on normal its like running with 25+ vigour\\nrun it on hard or harder its like running with \"5\" or less vigour\\n\\ngo hard for your much needed dex fag challenge :D Fans of Super Metroid & Castlevania: Symphony of the Night absolutely need to play this game. 10/10 This game is fun , It has Interesting art for a 2D game and you can use different weapon combos which is also nice.\\n\\nIt\\'s kinda challanging in the beginning but once you get good at it , it will be so much enjoyable. One of the best MetroidVania games. Amazing soundtrack and Pixel art. This game is astonishingly good.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t ready for just how dark this game was going to get - after a cutesy opening area the game gets really dark, really fast, and really uses its pixel art and accompanying soundtrack to create an atmosphere that\\'s downright oppressive.\\n\\nThe controls are really tight and the roll and (later) air dodge feel really good. I finished the game on Medium which offers a decent challenge (I died I\\'d say somewhere around 20 times over the course of the playthrough).\\n\\nThe game is short, but these days my time is at a premium and I really love these one-nighter kinds of games for those rare days I actually get time to sit and down and play games for a good chunk of time. Instead, the length is pretty well pitched - the pace of the game never falters and is far from outstaying its welcome by the end. I much prefer a tight, if brief game, than a bloated one with hours upon hours of repetitive sidequests. In any case, like many 2D classics, from Metal Slug to Kero Blaster, it\\'s all about the replayability - and I think I\\'d like to take this one on on Hard (and maybe Insane).\\n\\ntl;dr I finished this game in one sitting because it was too good to put down. Buy it. Momodora is an alright game.\\n\\nThe atmosphere, levels and music is reminiscent of a Castlevania game. The music is non-intrusive and great to listen to, and the sprites are high quality with a creepy-cute design that plays into the similarly creepy-cute and foreboding atmosphere. The levels are similarly varied; you can go through a forest, the cursed city of Karst, a flooded dungeon, a monastery, a castle, a memorial park, and the cultist chambers. On top of that, the controls feel quite responsive. These combine to make a quite striking game that is worth a playthrough.\\n\\nThe game is also fairly challenging. On the Normal difficulty, even as you gain Vitality fragments to increase your max HP, you can expect enemies to take off large chunks of your HP in a single hit. In turn, you can kill most common mobs in 3-5 hits, and the healing item costs a quarter-second of your time. This forces you to play smart, taking your time instead of ramming your face into the enemies until they die. The same holds true for bosses, though one may find it surprising that the final boss is strangely easier than the bosses they would have had to fight up to that point.\\n\\nHowever, the combat leaves much to be desired. Momodora has an item system that allows you to have 3 active items and 2 passive buffs. You can pick up and buy items, but of the ones you can buy, most of them are highly situational and have no real combat value, and the ones that do have combat value don\\'t really have anything interesting going for them. They don\\'t force you to play any differently than you already would have (in this case, mashing X on enemies, rolling through their attacks, and mashing arrows when you\\'re too far away to mash X); they serve more as +damage with different flavors.\\n\\nYou can shoot poisonous arrows, set enemies on fire with the maple leaf, cast magic and gain temporary attack boosts, but the magic is hilariously ineffective against bosses and pointless against mobs, as well as coming too late into the game to get some use out of it. Similarly, the combat enhancements and attack boosts are only really good by virtue of being the few items that you can use in combat.\\n\\nAs well, the bow\\'s charging mechanic is surprisingly not very good. It takes quite a while to get a charge initially, and the damage increase doesn\\'t feel worth the time spent even if you hit all your arrows. You also lose your charge when you roll, which is flow-breaking and feels bad to work around. You can improve your charge speed and get another charge level, but these improvements also come rather late into the game to do the player much good, and the extra charge level is just as pointless; Level 1 shoots 3 arrows in a spread and Level 2 shoots 3 arrows in a straight line with no observable damage boost.\\n\\nAlso, this is a personal thing and may not necessarily affect your playthrough, but shortly after I finished up with the first half of the game, I found myself stuck with no obvious way to progress for the better part of an hour. This may not necessarily be your experience, but several people that I talked to also found themselves stuck at around the same point in the game.\\n\\nSo to sum it up, Momodora is alright. Worth the $10 and 5 hours of playtime, and even has some replay value. It\\'s not quite a masterpiece, but for those looking for a Castlevania-styled game, you can\\'t really go wrong with Momodora. It\\'s good, like really goood!\\n\\nI neeeeeed more games like this...\\n\\nmore games need the feature of atacking the save point to quick save\\n A FUCKING LEAF Way too short to justify the price.\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering about my playtime, I left it on overnight. Twice. Learned that slapping boobs with maple leaf can kill people. Kill things wtih a leaf. What else do you need? Next game in SoulsBorne series should add maple leaf sword and Kaho as NPC. Very pretty and well designed game. If you like it casually, you won\\'t really mind the length as you should hopefully appreciate all the work that went into the polish and the art of the  6~ hour first run through. However if you really it, and enjoy NG+ modes and nohit challenge runs, you\\'ll find even more to love. This is a great platformer game! In some ways, it reminds of Megaman ZX for the Nintendo DS, as there are similarities in general gameplay mechanics.\\n\\nThis is a great game to get if you enjoy excellent sound and level design, just the right amount of equipment customization, tireless platformer/action gameplay, and a solid but not frustating challenge! If your looking for a great story, this probably isn\\'t for you. Everything else is top notch. short. good Overall:  6/10\\ntl;dr:  Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a satisfying game, but its nothing special beyond its aesthetic, it ultimately rings hollow, and you\\'re never really going to come back wanting more after you finish the first time, regardless of difficulty.

Its recommended you play with a controller.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=774694999\\nI\\'m going to start this review on a high note; the graphics and music are excellent.  The mood they set is the best feature of the game by far.  In fact, many people pick up this title for the aesthetic alone.  Beyond those, the game is pretty ordinary and doesn\\'t have much going for it.\\n\\nI maybe got 6-7 hours out of the game (with 1-2 hours idling), though I know most people said the game was essentially 5 hours long.  Thats short honestly, but it felt shorter because most of the game was... empty.\\n\\nLevel design is okay, works well with the graphical style and there is a bit of exploration.  Most of the areas are clearly defined, but don\\'t seem to have a real place in the world.  They\\'re just there... and in some cases, the placement of areas and overall themes feels like its a bit too inspired by the Castelvania games.  The transition from the tutorial area to the dark city was much too abrubt, however; we\\'re talking Michael Bay levels of abrupt transitioning.\\n\\nGameplay was fun but it suffered from creeping boredom.  The game starts with a learning curve, but you\\'ll pick up most of it quickly.  When you pick up a new mechanic or item, things do get entertaining again, but after the novelty quickly wears off its almost a chore to progress to the next one.  Unfortunately, most of the really interesting tools and abilities were placed very late game and you hardly get any use out of them.  You never actually feel like you\\'re going to stop playing, but the pacing is not good enough such that its constantly piquing your interest.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=774694969\\nBoss fights were challenging and interesting, using the dodge mechanic on a 2D field is neat.  Being unable to skip cutscenes between retries was annoying, however.  \\n\\nBeyond boss fights, the game is pretty easy (even on normal).  Scaling the difficulty doesn\\'t do much, since once you get the patterns of enemies down you\\'re going to dodge most of it or ignore enemies altogether, even if there are more of them and you have less health.  In fact, there is no way to mix things up; there is a set way to go through any encounter (unless you ignore it, in which case its also straightforward), so playing it on a higher difficulty isn\\'t going to make things more interesting.  The most your strategy might change on higher difficulties is rolldodging more and using more ranged attacks, which isn\\'t that entertaining to be honest.  The combat against anything but bosses boils down to mashing the attack button before the enemy can react to you, where they get hitstunned to death.  Few enemies actually have any armor, so the game overall makes pretty poor use of the dodge mechanic as a way to bypass shields and such; its there purely for dodging past enemies or attacks.  This straightforwardness of your approaches makes your progression brainless after you surpass the initial learning curves, and that does contribute to the hollowness of the game.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=774694983\\nThe biggest flaw is how limited your interactions with other characters are.  The game seemed to try really hard to get you attached to those characters within the brief few seconds you spend with each.  It sort of succeeds, but in doing so it backfires.  There are quite a few characters, and many of them barely get any screentime or dialogue at all.  I often found myself wanting more, but that more wasn\\'t going to come because the character interactions are barebones.  Thus, I was left looking at the void the game left, and it just made everything seem that much more empty.\\n\\nWhile I had some fun, ultimately I was just left wondering how I managed to get 7 hours of gameplay with this sucker. Finished the game on Hard mode on my first time playing it and finished in about 2:19 minutes. The rest of the playtime I have is from being AFK and respawn times and the sort. \\n\\nGame plays similar to a classic Metroidvania title, but with stores to get most of your upgrades instead of finding them around the world. Health expansions are pretty much the only secrets to find in the overworld, and all passive upgrades (that don\\'t use up an equipment slot) are rare, with only 4 to collect, doing fairly minor things (Air dodge, Faster bow charge speed, Bow charge lv2, and one that allows you to fast travel between same points. There\\'s also apparently a way to upgrade your leaf to get the \\'true ending\\')\\n\\nCombat has you dodging enemies attack with a dodge roll (and later, an air dodge), attacking enemies with either melee or ranged attacks, depending on how you want to play. The bow is bound to a separate button so you can very easily combo enemies after your standard 3-hit combo with melee.\\n\\nOther upgrades available are items that must be equipped taking up one of two passive item equip slots available to you. They do everything from letting you deal more damage, adding fire/poison to attacks, making enemies drop more money, to giving you health upon an enemies death instead of the in-game currency. There are also consumable \\'active\\' items, which you must manually use. There\\'s one that\\'s used to heal, some that give damage buffs, one that turns you into a cat to reach areas with small entry points, and some more.\\n\\nThe game in punishing but not unfair. Weirdly enough, I went through the game never dying to a boss once. Most of my deaths were from basic enemies, which is a change from standard Metroidvania gameplay in which the bosses are usually harder than the nearby enemies. I suspect this may have something to do with the fact that enemies do a surprising about of damage, and there\\'s often many on the screen at once.\\n\\nThe games bosses, past a certain point, can be completed in any order you wish with varying difficulty depending on what upgrades you have. There are about 8 bosses in the game total, with one appearing twice.\\n\\nThe game features some damn amazing sprites and backgrounds, along with an amazing soundtrack.\\n\\nAll in all, the game was solid, and I\\'ve heard that there are multiple endings but I can\\'t find it in me to replay the game, especially after getting 91% of the map completed and around 70% of all items in the game, on my first playthrough of the game, on hard mode, with a total playtime on my save of around 2 hours and 20 minutes. The game is simply too short for the price of admission, and seeing as you can buy some amazing procedurally generated rogue likes with similar metroidvania gameplay with far more replayability (like Rogue Legacy or Nuclear Throne) for only $5 more than this, I can\\'t recommend you buy this game unless it\\'s on sale or gets a price drop.\\n\\nI also noticed that it\\'s rather easy to become far too powerful in this game if you can be bothered fetching an item that grants enemies a chance to drop double currency on death early in the game. By the end of the game I had a setup that had me, no joke, 4 shot the final bosses first form, and 5 shot their second form (Two passive items, one called the Black Sachet that increases attack damage for a 5% chance to deal 10% damage to self on attack, another called the Necklace of Sacrifice that increases attack damage by 100% when low on health, which i found triggers at 25% health and below, and by using an active item that gives a 100% attack boost for 30 seconds in exchange of some health, and using the lv 2 bow charge which fired 5 arrows but only counts as one attack)\\n\\nOverall, I\\'d give this game a solid 8/10. It stands very strongly on its own merits, and will satiate you if you\\'re looking for a decent Metroidvania title. That being said, as I said before. Wait until this game is cheaper, like on sale or something because it\\'s honestly not worth the $9.99 USD they\\'re asking for it. very good This is a fantastic game. It\\'s somewhat short, but for $10 you can\\'t go wrong with this game. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is smooth and fun. 9/10, could be a little longer, but the other difficulties give it replayability. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, was the most refreshing gaming experience I have had in a while. The game looks beautiful, well polished, great gameplay, and has a great soundtrack to boot. If you are intersted in retro style games or just want to enjoy a well made, atmospheric game definitley check into Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. Its like castlevania, except with more waifus\\n\\n11/10 The game was as short as I expected, but it was much better than I expected (I was looking for a short game anyway). I bought the game because Steam said that it had overwhelmingly positive reviews and I was not disappointed. The gameplay takes a little while to get used to and you have to get the controls how you like them in the settings, but, after you face the first real boss,  it\\'s gold. \\nGameplay is much like you see in the Steam pictures. Like a lot of games of its type you go around a connected map that has save points across it, that you can eventually warp to. You have flowers that you can use as potions, so you have to pay attention to your health gauge as you get hurt often.\\nArt is one of my favorites for this type of game.\\nMusic was great.\\nDefault controls for the keyboard were awkard, but you can change them.\\nEasy, Medium, Hard, and (unlockable) Insane difficulties. I recommend Medium for the first game as Hard can be frustrating if you aren\\'t used to the controls and game-flow.\\nGeneral game length is about 5-6 hours.\\nPost-game you have Insane difficulty with different abilities and single hit death, collectables, a few \"side quests\", an alternate ending, and New Game+ with added difficulty while you keep equips. I really enjoyed this game. It feels too short after playing through once, but honestly at the same time it doesn\\'t drag on like some other games. Being so short, it leaves a refreshingly positive memory for me. If you like metroidvania style games with tight controls, this is the game. Tight controls, rewarding and challenging combat, satsifying exploration, beautiful art and a charming and surprisingly dark story, Momodora delivers on almost every level. This game is adorable. The art is so smooth and it handles very well.  I imagine I\\'ll play through this game a few times. ＫＩＬＬ\\u3000ＡＬＬ\\u3000ＴＨＥ\\u3000ＷＡＩＦＵＳ\\n\\nFun game with good controls and its own fair share of exploration. I like how the story is elaborated upon by the environments and the items you receive rather than directly through dialogue, which encourages going out of your way for secrets, and in some cases, perfecting boss fights. I like doing bosses on Leaf%.\\n\\nAlso has a very nice soundtrack.\\n\\nJust be sure though, to ＳＡＶＥ\\u3000ＴＨＥ\\u3000ＦＲＡＭＥＳ，ＡＮＤ\\u3000ＫＩＬＬ\\u3000ＴＨＥ\\u3000ＷＡＩＦＵＳ． Its a really good game, it reminds me of the old school castlevania games\\nsmooth controls, great mechanics, secrets everywhere\\nhas new game+ This game really impressed with me with both its aesthetic and its smooth, precise gameplay. There\\'s a surprising amount to explore and it\\'s a lot of fun to do so, especially if you\\'re a fan of worlds that interconnect. The game started out pretty hard for me, but I felt like I kept getting better at it and the endgame wasn\\'t too bad. And I could listen to that ambient soundtrack for ages! If you\\'re me and you grew up on 2D platformers with powerups and hidden stuff, this is absolutely the game for you. Come for the aesthetic, stay for the solid gameplay. Sad ending : | This game is gold, I\\'ve only played it through 4 times, but every single time I\\'ve had tons of fun. This game is very much worth it\\'s price. Even if you\\'d only ever play it once, it\\'s still great. Beating it on insane is very rewarding and I would suggest playing a pacifist run too. All in all, 100% recommend it to anyone. Excellent game. It could be a little longer, completing 100% was a bit quicker than expected, but that doesn\\'t diminish the greatness of the game. Well, I\\'m not a huge fan of side scrolling games what-so-ever, but everytime I died I found myself instead of rage quitting or leaving the game in general, I would shrug it off and keep playing. I\\'ve only played an hour of the game and I really like it, I see myself reccomending this to my friends whom have Steam and like side scrollers. I look forward to the content the game has in store for me in the near future! This game just seeps with heart, everything about it is just lovely; the soundtrack is beautiful, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is beautiful. I could just go on and on about how wonderful this game is and I probably still couldn\\'t do it credit. If you\\'re ever looking for something to play for a good few hours and have some extra money on Steam this is definitely a must play. I played this for 12 hours (It doesn\\'t show on my profile due to me playing it offline), but I have to say this is a impressively made game. It\\'s hard, but it\\'s difficulty adds to the fun of it. I haven\\'t played a game in a while that manage to pull me in like this game. My only complaint is the shortness of the game, but other than that I would recommended it to anyone. If you are searching for an classic Jump\\'n\\'Run/Hack\\'n\\' Slay Game then [i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] might be indeed for you.\\n\\nThe Game has all the classic Features you would expect from a Game of this Genre and after the first Playthrough I came to the following conlusions so far:\\n\\n[list]\\n[*][b]The Beginning felt very rough[/b] - It got even to that point where I wanted to request a refund from Steam but something told me that this might be one of those Games that literally demands from you to invest more then those two hours to get over the hill till you enjoy it.\\n[*][b]The Game won`t help you at all[/b] - I got more then once lost in the Game because I didn`t know what I should do next. This can be for some a Game Breaker while others demand exactly that from Games nowadays so be warned that if you are someone that needs always an Pointer where to go next this Game won`t be at all for you.\\n[*][b]Only 4:3 Aspect Ratio[/b] - Even the Game doesn`t support any other Aspect Ratio then 4:3 it was at no point a real Game Breaker for me since the 2D Art was always on Top and let me easily forget that Limitation as soon as I had played the Game for more then 30. Minutes in a row.\\n[*][b]It`s short[/b] - A Playthrough can be as short as three to four hours if you know what you have to do but at the same time can easily expand up to ten hours if you go and try to find every Secret in the Game or use one of the great Steam Guides. If you hate short Games you should stay away from the Game.\\n[*][b]Playing with the Keyboard felt sometimes a bit confusing[/b] - I played the first half of the Game with an Xbox Elite Controller and the Gameplay felt very smooth and enjoyable. Playing the rest of the Game with my Keyboard felt sometimes a bit confusing so make sure that if you are playing with the Keyboard that you don´t use the Default Setting.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThat`s pretty much it after the first six hours with the Game and my first Playthrough. If those issues aren`t a big deal for you then you will enjoy the Game as much as I did and so let`s sum it up:\\n\\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]\\n\\n[b]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/b] from [i]Bombservice[/i] is a solid Jump\\'n\\'Run/Hack\\'n\\' Slay 2D Game that does have a cute Protagonist, a nice Story with a sweat Soundtrack that you will enjoy most of the time and if you are aren`t afraid of a few rough Corners here and there then you will enjoy the Game, even while it`s short, as much as many others already did before me for sure too.\\n\\nThumbs Up.\\n\\nThat´s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-) Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a beautiful game. There is so much detail and the animation is so fluid and pretty! The combat system is fairly complex and you need to learn to time your dodges and your attacks well to defeat the bosses and various monsters you will meet along the way. If the game is too easy for you, you can pick Hard and Insane difficulties to really challenge yourself. The only thing I feel like this game is lacking in is the story-telling. It\\'s not bad, I just feel like the game could have expanded on the story more, or told it a better way. In conclusion, the game looks amazing, plays amazing, and is really something that is worth getting in my opinion. First of i would like to say that anyone who has looked at this game and then taken the time to read the reviews of it should already just give in and buy this game. The handling of this game is flawless the design is by far one of the most beautiful i have seen in a pixel game and the bosses give a fully immersive flow of battle while in fight.\\n\\nThe only problem i have with this game is the fact that it ends... A wonderful game that is very dear to my heart. Very challenging, but lots of fun!\\nThe pixel art style is awesome and the characters are cute. The story is wonderful too!\\nAlso KITTIES! <3\\n\\nI recommend. Highly recommend to any fan of action-based games.\\nTight controls, but also with some dedicated frames during attacking similar to games such as Castlevania. Dedicated dodge button\\nAbsolutely georgeous art direction\\nSame goes for the soundtrack-does a great job at conveying the theme of each area. I also enjoyed that some tracks go for more ambience-focused as well.\\nThere\\'s plenty of room to explore and find items that can change how you combat enemies.\\nPleasently challenging bosses that reward skill, and with no-damage clears give items as well. \\n\\nOverall absolutley fantastic work, I wish more games in this time would just focus on making a solid experience such as this I really enjoyed this game. It kind of reminds me of dark souls a bit. It was a bit challenging but that made it more rewarding when you got past an area. I loved the level design too, all the areas were beautiful. Great game! It has simple controls, gameplay mechanics are great, artwork is nice, never felt bored walking around the map, bosses are challenging, and the story is really nice and well presented. Would definently play it again. Great game. Just remember to enable V-Sync by using the .inf. Can\\'t do it in-game. Remember the wind box.\\n\\nIn all actuality this game is a hidden gem and you should definitely play it if you get the chance. One of the best games I have had the pleasure of struggling through easy on. you allowed to hit decayed woman boobs with maple leaf \\nUnderlooked gem, feels like if Super Metroid and Dark Souls had a love child and made it kind of creepy-cute. Buy this game, I\\'d put it up there with Shovel Knight and Cave Story as the great retro games. Pretty short (3-5 hours) but REALL well designed. Combat is simple but impactful and every enemy has a noticable tell for their attacks. Bosses are challenging and satisfying to beat, and they reward you with really powerful items if you don\\'t get hit. The map is sizable with optional paths and secrets like illusory walls. yea its gud. Play it with a snes controller, do yourself some justice. Almost perfect. The game is responsive, animation is fluid, combat is fast and challenging.  But the way it handles its two difficulties is frustrating. Fresh off buying a 1080 GTX, this is the game I ended up playing first.  It\\'s just that fun. It\\'s a very fun and exciting game. It may seem short bit trying to get 100% is gonna be hard, there\\'s also a new game+ for after you beat it for the first time. I really recommend this game. Amazing metroidvania game with solid mechanics and dark themes; short and sweet, all of that for the right price. Had a lot of fun with dis game the combat was solid looked amazing and was worth it if you want to stick with it. But I\\'m bad at vidya games and gave up. Give it a look though. in my opinion this was all around a great game, it took me about 8-9 hours to beat this and get most if not all of the items. if you like 2D platformers with a nice story, amazeing fluid animations and combat, i can not recommend this more for you. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game that has had me thinking quite a bit about achievements lately.  Growing up, there was simply no such thing as in game achievements.  Despite this, I recall doing many self imposed challenges in games.  I can\\'t imagine how many different ways I played through Mega Man X on the Super Nintendo.  Now, you might be thinking, “Steam achievements are common place today, what does this have to do with anything?”  I\\'ll get to that shortly.  When I first learned about Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight the one thing that had me second guessing whether or not I should buy the game right away was the fact that many reviewers said it was a short game.  Clearly I decided to purchase it.\\n\\nReverie Under the Moonlight is actually the 4th Momodora game, but as it\\'s a prequel there is no reason to be concerned that you won\\'t understand what\\'s going on.  The story is fairly simple.  You play as Kaho, a maple leaf wielding priestess from Lun.  She was sent to the now cursed city Karst to find a way to dispel the evil and corruption slowly creeping across the land.  As you explore Karst and the surrounding areas you meet assorted characters and learn how the curse has changed their lives.  Several of the characters were interesting enough that I found myself wanting to know more about their backgrounds than is actually revealed in the game.\\n\\nAside from the introductory segment, you are given nearly complete freedom to explore the map.  Barring the beginning and end of the game, you are able to fight the bosses in any order you wish.  There are items that allow further exploration, but typically not in such a way that causes the game to be strongly linear.  Kaho is able to have three active items and two passives equipped at a time.  Active items have a set number of uses and can be replenished at any save point.  She can also obtain key items that don\\'t require using a slot and bestow various bonuses.  The ability to choose what you equip allows for a degree of customization.  I found myself using a set of items for general exploration and another set for major battles.  Most of the items were useful but there were a few that probably should have been key items instead as they didn\\'t seem good enough to warrant taking up a slot under any circumstances.\\n\\nCombat plays a fairly large role in the game.  I played through the first time on the hard difficulty setting and couldn\\'t afford to take more than a few hits.  Kaho\\'s dodge roll is one of the primary ways of avoiding damage due to the fact that she is invincible while rolling.  For dealing damage she can combo with her maple leaf, use offensive magic, and attack from a distance with her bow.  The bosses are a lot of fun, but there is a boss reward system that I\\'m not so sure about.  If you defeat a boss without taking damage you\\'re awarded with a bonus item.  Many of these items are incredibly useful.  What\\'s the issue with a reward for playing well?  As far as I recall the game doesn\\'t actually ever tell you about the reward system.  I knew about it going into the game, but a friend played through the entire game without getting any of them and had no idea he missed out.  For better or worse, the game is short enough that it wasn\\'t hard for him to play through it again and to obtain them.\\n\\nYes, what they say is true.  Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is indeed a short game.  My fourteen hour playtime reflects going through the game three and a half times.  As I mentioned earlier, this game had me thinking about achievements.  I found myself going out of the way to run through the game without killing enemies, without dying, and also eventually on the highest difficulty.  Other than a New Game+ mode where you keep the majority of your items, attempting to get the achievements is unfortunately about all the replay value this game offers.  I\\'m not sure I would have done these unorthodox runs if there hadn\\'t been achievements for them, but I am sure that I wouldn\\'t have done it if I had not found the game to be thoroughly entertaining.\\n\\nAlthough it doesn\\'t take very long to complete, it would be a shame to miss out on this game due to its low completion time.  Nearly everything about this game is fantastic.  The world is gorgeous and has a very original feel to it.  The piano based soundtrack is generally calm and subdued, but changes appropriately when action picks up.  And perhaps more important than anything else, the action provides a solidly entertaining challenge.  The only major flaw that comes to mind is the lack of ability to customize button mapping for game pads.  Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game that left me excited for the possibility of future installments in the series.  The developers would be crazy not to further expand upon this universe.  I\\'d absolutely recommend this game to any fans of action platformers that are alright with what might be a fairly low playtime.  This game was definitely worth the asking price.\\n\\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25660729-CelerySpin/]Like the review? Follow my curator page to see my thoughts on other games.[/url] I can say this game is worth of its full price. Really well done sprites, fun and slightly dificult gameplay, nice story and a good soundtrack. If you like metroidvania and old school gaming, this is definitely a game worth of playing. ((See negative comments near the bottom))\\n\\nWonderful!! Reverie Under the Moonlight is a perfect example of a game being high quality not because of graphics, retro nostalgia or a never before seen gameplay mechanic, but caring attention to detail and an appreciation for the little things. Combat is solid, relying mostly on your skill and tactic rather than just having the best weapon. There are upgrades to increase your damage and effects, but what\\'s nice is that most of these upgrades come in the form of items you equip at the cost of your pocket space, which is also where you equip something like say, the item that magnetizes money to you. Essentially, this game forces you to have a customized playstyle. Your limited space for equipables leaves you to stop and think for a moment about what your inherent playstyle actually is. Which is good, because with all the exploring and backtracking that is par for the course in Metroidvania games you\\'ll have plenty of opportunity to experiment as you hunt for goodies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more the story and presentation is excellently executed. As someone who hasn\\'t played any other games in this series, I had a fairly good idea of who I was, what was going on and what I was doing. Things never go into much depth, but it serves as a tight setup for the actual game. There are a few moments where you have to make decisions on behalf of your character, and I remember them being relevant moments of gameplay that actually affected me. Mostly because the more morally just choice to make was the one demanding the most sacrifice. I always love it when I inadvertently get the Happy True Ending my first playthrough just because I myself decided to go the extra mile for the sake of just doing it. I wanted to see everything the game had to offer, which actually brings me to the negative.\\n\\nThis game is a bit short. It\\'s still fairly robust I\\'d say, but even with the map getting completely explored you could beat this in a day if you plan your schedule around it. The map does its job I suppose, showing where the save points are and giving a small indications as to what areas still have rooms to explore. However that being said, why couldn\\'t this practical map be a part of the warping between bells ability? When you get the ability to warp from place to place, you have to pick and choose from a typed list of the named locations. Which is awkwardly impractical in use because I don\\'t always remember what areas are named what, I just know I need to do more in the bottom corner. I\\'ll be honest, I hardly used the warp feature at all. Even when I finally found the bell that was closest to where I wanted to go, it just made me wonder why I couldn\\'t be allowed to go to any bell rather than one of the few at the entrance of an area?... Last but not lease, I sometimes wished the visual cues were more varied. It was hardly an issue really, until the later boss fights when the attack telegraphs got mixed with the blips that indicate the air dodge is recharged.\\n\\nOther than that, Reverie Under the Moonlight is an excellent game. You can just tell it was a labor of love, and even if it never rises to popularity I will always appreciate it for being what it is.\\n Absolutely worth your time, straight forward story line and slightly difficult game play. Very recommended if you\\'re into this kind of content. It\\'s good. Buy it. ok i uusually dont write reviews but this is a real good game, if you have funds, definitely get it. it also has plenty of secrets for all any completionists PROS:\\n+Awesome combat system.\\n+Good Soundtrack.\\n+Boss fights.\\n+Unique itens.\\n+Pretty good lore so far.\\n\\nCONS:\\n-Can be pretty hard/annoying, but nothing more than this.\\n\\nRecommend for anyone who likes Metroidvania stylish games.\\n10/10.\\n Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight was frustrating the first time around due to certain annoyances in the game. Of course, the 2nd time around felt just a bit less frustrating. I would even dare to say fun for few parsec of a second. I just made it sound like it wasn\\'t fun for too long. \\n\\nFor those whom don\\'t know, a parsec is 3.26 light years in lenght\\n\\nAnyway, fun is still fun!\\n\\nAllow me to spill.\\n\\nThe moment you encounter the first common enemy that actually attacks you; that was the moment anyone would be like \"HOLY $@$#\" that hurts. How can a cute little imp do so much damage. Little imps, witches, spiders, hounds and etc, all of them can send you straight to trama. \\n\\nAlthough it isn\\'t the first game I encounter that has common enemies that can almost kill you in one hit. Of course, getting hit too often can be annoying if you\\'re trying to figure out how to play a game. Once you get uses to it, than everything is a breeze.\\n\\nThan there is the first boss fight; How do you fight a boss that can kill you in one hit. A boss that puts you in a pinch with puffs of poison on on your back. If trying to put a player in panic was their idea, well done!\\n\\nYou know what I like about games like Momodora: RUtM, the entire map is a big gaint labyrinth. Although sometimes a labyrinth style game can be short. Momodora: RUtM did felt short, but I was mused. \\n\\nFavorte part of the game was walking into a room with a crazy cat zombie witch. \\n\\nOverall, I\\'m okay with the starting off annoyance. The art was nice. Certain items were either funky or pointless. Of course, having options and trying to figure out what works and what doesn\\'t is always a good thing. I think the story could have been driving deeper.\\n\\nI give it a 3.5 out of 5. (1st review hype!)\\n\\nIf you have played any new \\'RPG\\' game recently, you\\'re probably getting used to being told where to go, what to do at least 3 times a day. It\\'s just the way developers figured out to hook a good part of the audience (the \\'even below the average casual\\' part) that would otherwise leave for \\'easier\\' games, games where you don\\'t ever get lost, probably not even RPG games.\\n\\nOn my experience, Momodora restores a good part of the \\'Hey, it\\'s you who is supposed to play this game\\' deal in videogames. Made me realize how used to I was to this current trend of easy-to-follow tourism-simulator games.\\n\\nThis game is reasonably hard, hard enough to punish you if you\\'re not paying attention, which I guess is the right amount. It\\'s also mysterious and this plays a great deal in your playthrough. The game won\\'t tell you what to do and where to go. It may tell you what to do [u][i]or[/i][/u] where to go at some points, but still you have to figure out most stuff for yourself. Given it\\'s non-linear style, that\\'s a lot of running around, but there is plenty of things that you can do and you don\\'t have to follow any order for the most of them. The game also gives you a nice map of the areas you\\'ve visited, so run for the unknown and you\\'ll be rewarded !\\n\\nMomodora is a cute, fun and complete experience, with smooth fighting mechanics for a platformer, lots of rewards for the most tenacious players, and of course adorable cute crying sounds when you die...\\n\\nThat\\'s it.\\nHave a goood run ! Honestly this is hard on so many level at only normal. But once you tried hard.. and insane.. That shit aint easy. 10/10 could do a speed run Good game. Solid 7 / 10. Not great, but definitely fun to play. Wish it was a little more challenging. Bosses especially. After having recently come of HLD, which felt very well balanced and had great heart thumping boss encounters, this aspect was a bit of a letdown. But, again, a good game.\\n\\nOne piece of feedback for the devs: improve your map. Colour code areas, and mark locked doors as well as points of interest -- beyond save points and chests. At some level it\\'s fun to remember where stuff is and then backtrack to it... but, near the end of the game I found myself wandering around a bit too much just to find out how to continue. Very well crafted controls and game mechanics, and hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. A masterpiece.\\n\\nMomodora is an amazingly well-executed action-adventure title. I mainly enjoyed it for its atmosphere, its firm-but-fair difficulty, and the extraordinarily captivating music. It also features one of the most memorable boss fights I\\'ve experienced recently. Highly recommended. I highly recommend this game. The story is awesome, the artwork is amazing, the combat is satisfying. PLAY THIS NOW Wonderful gaame. Reminds me of the old school adventure platformers. oh yes my only issue is that is a little short and we cant get all the momodora games on this platform I will keep it short, as is this game, short and sweet.\\n\\na huge plus is that you don\\'t have to play the game in a specific order, i beat it twice and i went in a completley different boss order the second time around, plus found some new secrets, the game has replay value since you could always find a new secret or shave of time from your previouse round.\\nthere is also more then one ending wich is a plus.\\n\\nif you like metroidvania type games then this is a no brainer, get it, play it, enjoy.\\n\\n This game is awesome! Much more polished than all 3 other games, and is much more chellenging, too. Would reccomend this game to anybody. Why? BECAUSE IT IS FRICKIN\\' EPIC. 9.2/10 I really enjoyed this game and I reccommend it to anyone that likes metroivania style games. It\\'s fun, not too long, and difficult at times, but not to the point of frustration. I loved the soundtrack and the sound design, as well as the pixel art. I recommend expert mode, too much fun. If you liked any post SOTN 2d Castlevanias, or Super Metroid and newer Metroids, this game might be for you. \\nYou\\'ll also get incredibly pretty pixel artsy 2d sprites and backgrounds, a neat soundtrack and Dark Souls\\'esque UI aesthetics.\\nDifficulty should be below Super Metroid, but it isn\\'t your modern \"imma blaze through dis\" game.\\nWhat might be a negative point for you, though, a 100% playthrough is possible in like 7 hours, maybe less, maybe more, depending on you. I still think the 9.99$ pricetag fits the title greatly, as I\\'ve enjoyed this game far more thoroughly than many full priced games (which I even played less). The atmosphere - the combination of the soundtrack, the style and the characters - is what made this game have a special place in my heart forever. \\nDefinitely recommended. For 10 bucks you\\'ll have some great evenings with this game. I\\'ve always been of the opinion that a game should feel a bit too short compared to overstaying its welcome. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight hits that spot. My first playthrough was just a hair under 4 hours with 98% map exploration rate and I found myself wishing it had been just a bit longer, with one more area to explore or another boss to fight. The game does have longevity in the form of additional difficulties and things like pacifist-runs for which achievements are given as well.\\n\\nThe normal difficulty is a bit easy for people experienced in 2D action games, so those harder difficulties are appreciated. But despite the lack of challenge in normal difficulty, the game is a joy to play thanks to the smooth controls and lovely pixel graphics. Some people have compared this to Dark Souls but the similarities are few. There are no RPG elements of any kind, nor a wide array of weapons to wield. There are health items that are replenished at save points, but that\\'s pretty much it as far as similar gameplay elements go. Momodora is more like a Metroid game or a later Castlevania title. Loved the concept, graphics are SUPERB, animations are SMOOTH, everything is lovely and flows gently. A really great platformer. Congratulations!!! Gameplay is kickass.\\n\\nNow, if I were to say something bad about it, would be about it\\'s storytelling. The NPCs you find and talk with usually have some really boring dialogues, and the worst defect of all, is that all of them sound like the same person - we know it\\'s a developer who writes their dialogue, but that should not seem obvious. Yet all of them are without personality, they all have the same attitude, same manner of saying things, all the same boring \"everything is doomed\" talk. I\\'ve talked to every characther, up to all possible dialogues and they utterly bored me. Except maybe for the imp girl.\\n\\nSo, as a constructive critique, I would suggest that better attention be put in the dialogues, in actually crafting the NPCs with distinctive personality and useful things to say. It\\'s okay if one of them is there to tell the story to the player, but all of them repeating the same mantra without any relevant new details is tiresome. Which was dissapointing, because I really liked the concept of the characthers and expected them to tell me interesting things. Amazing game, truly wonderful in gameplay and story. Though very short and had lots of potential, it\\'s still a good game to play enjoy the story. This game is lovely. They Bleed Pixels meets Dark Souls style gameplay in Momodora. The controls are tight, the art and world design is stunning and the bosses are satisfyingly difficult to find, fight aand defeat. The Royal Pinacotheca is all you need. That song is krey Very pretty and satisfying game. Feels like you exploring. Great, yet simple gameplay. Usually when I come acorss games like this with very simple battle mechanics I grow bored very quickly, but this game was different. It felt great, the enemies and battle system are very well balanced, and it felt like I was playing metroid fusion again. Metroid fusion/ any sidescrolling metroid is more complicated, has a bigger world, is harder etc., but this game was close enough to that metroid feel leaving me happy. Kinda short relative to most games, but I think the length of the game works well for this title. It\\'s also pretty cheap. My only complaint is I wish it had a deeper story and more character development, which would require a longer game. Great, simple, and relaxing game nonetheless. Hey! I recently played through every Momodora game and made a review on them Including this game. The Short answer is I would recommend - Great game. If you want to see the review on this and the rest of the Momodora games here is my video. \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peGzJ2a7MIs A fantastic action platformer with tight controls, challenging gameplay, and a large world to explore.\\nThe game takes about 5 hours to complete one run. \\nHas a nice art style and a solid sound track.\\nThere is also a fair amount of replayability.\\nI\\'d reccomend this game to anyone who has interest in this game or is a fan of the genre. It’s a smooth, silky, moody game with beautiful locations and criminally low sales. You definitely should buy it, if you are into cute, but dusky metroidvania-esque games. It\\'s not very big, nor superb, but still a good and solid game nonetheless.\\n \\nI could call this game a “cutelvania”, but it has somewhat grim and dark theme, which reminds me of certain game series where you must roll, not die, git gud, and replenish healing items at checkpoints. In this game, you will explore well-designed, melancholic and moody locations, fight various monsters and not so generic bosses. \\n \\nGameplay: it is your classic metroidvania: you explore; you pull some levers; you find bosses; you defeat bosses; you aquire abilities to progress through previously blocked paths (there are not many of those, though). Actions like jumping, rolling (which has invincibility frames) and attacking all feel smooth, silky and very responsive — the character does exactly what you want. The combat is fair (I highly recommend playing on “hard”, since “easy” is just too easy), quick and more or less interesting. \\n \\nStory: sadly it\\'s not that engaging and not very deep. I can accept environmental storytelling, with the lore hidden in shadows, item descriptions and character dialogues, but Momodora has none of that.\\n \\nCharacters: Kaho will transform into a cat with a maple leaf in the teeth, which is lovely. Meow.\\n\\nP.S. For more hidden gems, follow the steam [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/10722089/]CRIMINALLY Low Sales[/url] curator. A really fun and enjoyable game reminiscent of Castlevania. A real bargin at that price though a somewhat ephemeral experience. An absolute must have game. I got it on sale for seven bucks and it was a fucking steal, this game is polished till you can see your face shine in it. The art is amazing, to any of the art team if you\\'re seeing this you have talent like noone i\\'ve ever seen before. This combined with the music that sounds like it was produced by a triple A studio truly sets this wonderously ominous and exciting atmosphere that I\\'ve never felt in a game before. The gameplay is like that of a metroidvania, combined with elements of dark souls. Now before you stop reading, I was never into the souls style game as I thought it was always unfair, but this game makes me want to revisit them! The game will test you, its challenging but fair. Every death you have (aside from an insta-kill pit or two) will make you want to try again. The game is designed to make you feel like you\\'re fighting an uphill battle, but that there\\'s hope and that you can beat that boss you\\'re having a hard time with, or that section you just can\\'t get past. The boss fights in this game were something to behold, each one stands out with their own music and uniqueness that makes them unforgettable. They all act differently, and while some didn\\'t have a huge intro they still felt important. You still felt as if there was tension, that there were stakes, that something was at risk. The small problems I had, specifically how you got the \"good\" ending, don\\'t do enough to ruin this amazing experience. Now if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'m gonna go run new game plus. I highly recommend this game for people that like difficult 2d side-scrolling platformers with challenging bosses, 2d action based combat, fantastic pixel art and plenty of collectibles to find in game. I enjoyed the atmosphere and sprite designs and the music never felt out of place or intrusive. \\n\\nFor me, the combat never crossed into being too frustrating to enjoy even on harder difficulties, but your experience may vary.\\n\\nThe only mark I have against Momodora: RUtM is that I felt it was lacking in terms of character development; you play as a silent protaganist (which is not a bad thing in itself) and there really isn\\'t much going on with any of the side characters.\\n\\nI picked this game up on sale for $6.99, and I\\'ll say it was well worth the price. Ah.. Being able to play good games once in awhile is amazing. Forget where I saw something about this game, but I knew I\\'d like it just looking at it for like.. 30 seconds. Anyway, onto the review!\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an Action metroidvania game. it has a nice visual style with tight controls and challenging gameplay. It has lots of exploration, decent enemy design and amazing boss fights. If you are interested in anything you see here, I\\'m confident it will be worth it to you. If not, I really suggest you give it a try anyway, just wait for a steam sale to come around. I highly recommend it, even if you don\\'t want to finish it, its a very fun and enjoyable experience overall.\\n\\nTLDR; A nice action platformer with tight controls and amazing boss fights as well as rewarding exploration. Its a great metroidvania game, and anyone interested in games like that. This is definitely for you, even if you\\'re not so interested I highly recommend this game.\\n\\n Positives:\\n\\n  - Great visual style\\n\\n  - Tight controls\\n\\n  - Amazing boss fights\\n\\n  - Rewarding exploration\\n\\n  - Challenging\\n\\n  - Decent soundtrack\\n\\n Negatives:\\n\\n  - Sadly no real \"story\"\\n\\n  - Sometimes goes into that territory of \"frustrating\" instead of challenging\\n\\n  - A bit repetitive at times\\n\\n Conclusion:\\n\\n  Momodora is a neat metroidvania title thats challenging in most areas, as well as relaxing to play at others. I highly recommend this game to anyone whos slightly interested. It has tight controls, challenging gameplay as well as nice visuals and a neat soundtrack to go with it. I hope more people give this game a chance, and buy it if they\\'re interested!\\n\\n Incredible spritework, haunting soundtrack, tight controls and a love for detail, borrowing from classics like Super Metroid and Castlevania Symphony of the night but staying true to its own character, Momodora RUtM is a delightful little platformer with tons of charm. It\\'s awesome! Masterpeace! I finished the game five times on different difficulty and I wanna do it again. momodora is an amzing game. I played it on hard and it was the perfect balance between challenging and fun. The atmosphere the game brings is very captivating.Also the combat keeps your mind very active on whats going on, from trying to beat each boss without taking damage to making your way through enemies to get to the save point. Absolutely fantastic metroidvania. Great art, great gameplay. I haven\\'t played the others so this may be ignorant, but it has certain aspects that seem Souls inspired, such as consumables recharging at every checkpoint. If you were ever a fan of Castlevania or Metroid, please pick this up. -the art\\n-the sound\\n-the controls\\n-the difficulty\\n-the feels\\n-the momodora\\n-the recommends You beat the tar out of random creatures that stand in your path with a maple leaf. A freaking maple leaf. You\\'re doing this while saving your village I guess, but YOU. BEAT. THINGS. WITH. A. LEAF. This game is amazing, it\\'s like 2d souls \\nThe game looks beautiful especially for a sprite based game. Everything is fluent. The main character looks especially good.The music is pretty good. Its atmospheric and memorable.The controls are great. Not the best in 2d games but still very solid. If you die its not because of the controls.There are a quite number of upgrades you can get.The atmoshphere is just amazing. Its creepy , you feel isolated and its just does such a great job at showing you the situation this world is in. \\nMy first playthrough took me about 4 hours sooooooo yeah the game is pretty short but honestly I think its worth your money. There is a reason why the reviews say \"Overwhelmingly positive\". Fantastic art, interesting ambiguous story and difficult timing-based gameplay. Clearly heavily influenced by Dark Souls. Similarly to DS, I\\'d recommend only playing with a pad; the keyboard controls feel pretty clumsy to me.

Check out our Forum here.[/url]\\n\\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game which proves that simplicity is sometimes the best way to achieve greatness. One of the consequences to this approach though is that the game is very short - I think it took me less than 5 hours to complete. But, in the Metroidvania Genre this is standard fare, and the game has multiple difficulty levels and achievement upgrade items to unlock for perfect running bosses, so I think there is still a lot of value in the price tag. Most important in that value though is a great memorable challenge. \\n\\nThe Priestess you play as has only two weapons for the entire game; A Maple Leaf and a Bow. Using a controller, the Bow is fired with one of the shoulder buttons, and your maple leaf with the face buttons. The bow has a chargeable attack which deals more damage and fires a spreadshot, and because of this control scheme you can charge it while you perform melee attacks, allowing for an interesting dynamic of combos and skill. The Maple Leaf seems like an odd choice for a weapon, but in practice it whips out similar to some sword animations in other games, and it has a familiar three hit combo you can mess with. \\n\\nRUTM is tightly designed around these two mechanics making traversing the castle interesting because of the gameplay alone rather than because of variety in upgrades. Attacks have a crunchy impact to them, hitstunning enemies in a satisfying way. You also have a dodge roll that moves in the direction you push the button, so it\\'s less awkward to use than the Symphony of the NIght back dash - if you don\\'t mind me comparing Momodora to its Metroidvania forefather. \\n\\nSince there are no other weapons, exploring the castle unlocks new traversal options that add variety to the combat in interesting ways, and like any well-designed Metroidvania, it\\'s fun and satisfying to explore to find new relics and upgrades. \\n\\nI\\'ve spent this entire review talking about the gameplay, and I could just leave it at that - it\\'s totally worth playing for that alone. But I don\\'t think I could end this review without mentioning the beautiful pixel art and music. The art speaks for itself - the screenshots should be enough to show how good it is. But between these two elements, along with the afforementioned game design triumphs, Momodora is a beautiful little game. \\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is short and sweet, but also challenging and deeply satisfying, making it one of my favorite Metroidvania games,\\n\\n4 out of 5 A lovingly crafted game. You get the same magical feeling playing Momodora as with other legendary titles of similar genres, such as Cave Story and Undertale. Momodora nails the artwork, gameplay, and music, but so do many other games. What really sets it apart is a sense of wonder and mystery that is impossible to desribe, but that you can feel within the first minute of playing.\\n\\nI loved every second of this game and I highly, highly recommend it. This is a great little Metroidvania type game. Of the DS games, closest to Order of Ecclasia in that it can be difficult at times. After the intro the game opens up for exploration with plenty of collectable hidden about. Art style is awesome... Great Metroidvania game! Would really recommend this game to Castlevania fans! Wish it were longer. Short but very fun game. It can be a bit hard at times but certainly worth the effort. Gives a Castlevania meets Bloodborne kind of vibe. A well made metroidvania type game. Visuals, animation and sound are good. View the screenshots and video on the store page for examples.\\nThe difficulty is well balanced. Normal difficulty is challenging enough to not feel like a waste of time.\\nInitially the controls felt a bit clunky, for example you can\\'t cancel out of a dodge roll and you can\\'t change direction mid attack. Eventually I got used to it.\\nThe game is very short, around 4 hours, which felt a bit lacking. That game is amazing and will suit every Metroidvania lovers.\\nDifficulties are on point, enemies are fun and varied enough for this short game.\\nThe story is also simple, simple but nice.\\nI hope to see more from these developers ! This is an excellent game. It keeps giving you items and abilities to let you progress further into the game so it is not so linear. However, I feel like if I were to stop playing for a few days, I would be lost on where I was going. There are many secrets and some deep dialog in which I had to just stop and absorb the emotion behind what some characters say. It had great visuals, art, and music. The gameplay was very fluid and responsive. It’s game like these that need to become popular and praised. \\n\\nOlder styled games like this, Shovel Knight, and Cave Story seem to have the most fluid and enjoyable gameplay, along with great pixel art.\\n\\nHowever, I have just beaten it, and the ending kind of sucked. It was a good ending, but it was just so fast and the final boss was too easy. I wish I could have seen something like a cutscene of the world being cleansed and everyone happy or something other than text telling me I brought peace to the world... It was also a very short game, I beat it in less than 5 hours, but I guess I can replay it. It says there are some changes to the game once you have beaten it, but I have not explored that yet. I would have liked to have seen more to this game, more weapons, more characters, more environmental interaction (from weapons)... just more. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this game if you have the money to spend. I liked the experience and I am sure that I will replay it some day in the future. This game is awesome to say the least. The combat is great and the music is very enchanting. Would highly recommend anyone to play this game! Graphics wise it looks good and pleasing to the eyes. Cant wait for a sequel if there will be one. :) The game is definitely worth a $10 buy, if not more. My only real issues stem from a desire to see  stronger story elements, as those presented are quite fractured and leave a bit to be desired, but the gameplay is undeniably solid and fun. VERY good metroidvania, even though a little bit too short (your first run will probably be 6 hours without going for 100%), I would have loved a couple more areas and bosses, but what I got here is so good that I don\\'t mind at all.\\n\\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\\n+ Controls feel VERY good, not once have I died or even took damage because of them, if you mess up it is 100% your fault;\\n+ 3 + 1 difficulty settings;\\n+ Nonlinear;\\n+ Lots of helpful items, everything\\'s useful for a different scenario, but you never find yourself depending on them;\\n+ A fair amount of secrets and illusory walls;\\n+ Replay value; (2 endings, NG+, unlockable Insane mode, achievements for pacifist and no-death runs)\\n+ Well animated pixel graphics;\\n+ Fitting BGM;\\n+ Silent protagonist; (yes this is a plus)\\n+ Female protagonist; (also a big plus)\\n+ Protagonist can transform into a cat;\\n+ So many things remind me of Dark Souls and Castlevania: mainly the atmosphere, and also the music, the bosses, the NPCs, the item descriptions revealing bits of lore... and so on, but I don\\'t want to sound like \"lololol dork soulz ripoff xd\"\\n\\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\\n- Not enough traps;\\n- Not enough ambushes;\\n- Not enough spikes;\\n- Not enough bewb slapping; Well worth a play through, doesn\\'t take long and the game is extremely well put together. Awesome Metroidvania, I spent about 7 hours on this so far and it doesnt seem old or tired in the least at this point. I highly recommend this if you want a Castlevania SOTN-lite kinda game. *load up game*\\n*put insane difficulty*\\n*insta regret*\\n*proceed to get destroyed by pixel*\\n\\n10/10 would go die again One of the most interesting Metroid-Vania\\'s I\\'ve ever played. You won\\'t be disappointed.\\n9/10\\nProTip: Play on Hard. Sprites are cute, animations are nice, controls are pretty fluid once you get the hang of the buttons. Also kind of sad at times. Overall a very complete experience, would recommend. The backtracking is something serious, they should really make games that do not need that much of it to progress. But the game is well done and fun, I am liking it so far. Beautiful visuals and perfectly elegant sound combine with tight, responsive controls and an intriguing dark premise in Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight.\\n\\nAt first, I was daunted by the difficulty, even at the easiest difficulty. However, I soon remembered my old adventuring skills from games I grew up playing. Despite the welcoming art style, the game is not easy in any sense of the term, but it is fair, and that\\'s something a lot of games now don\\'t have. You\\'ll notice, when you play Momodora, that a mindfulness to level design is present here. It\\'s subtle -- which is part of why it\\'s so excellent -- but the developer clearly put a *huge* amount of care into making sure everything was fair.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the developer is also quick to respond to any question or request for help from the community, and clearly cares about players\\' enjoyment of the game. That really rated highly with me, especially when the game itself is already so well-made.\\n\\nThe story is a little minimalistic, and that might be discouraging for some. It\\'s also not a particularly happy story, but it is satisfying in many ways. The dark elements and horror really make the aesthetic work perfectly and, for me, that was part of the strong appeal of the setting\\'s immersion.\\n\\nSome of the enemies might seem a little cheap sometimes, but really it\\'s more that they\\'re just challenging and later environments can be very tricky. Every enemy has a strategy, just like every boss has a pattern; an exciting added challenge is that if you beat a boss without taking damage, they will drop a special, usually very powerful, item. It adds genuine replay value, which is much appreciated.\\n\\nOverall, Momodora satisfies and keeps its appeal strong even after completing it. There\\'s great incentive for returning to it, and the developer is so active in the community that there\\'s no possibility you will ever feel abandoned, or that the game isn\\'t a priority to its developer. I\\'m highly impressed by both game and developer and, as long as you\\'re up for a challenge, I unreservedly recommend Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight.\\n Great game! Its not fun. Its dificult and the controls are complex and unintiuitive. I GUESS if thats your cup of tea, you MIGHT like it. Their is no story present (as far as I could tell in the amount I played), and unless your on the lowest difficulty, even the simplest monster will kill you in 2~3 hits. Definitly a game that will make you rage. Major Souls Vibes from this game, It\\'s a Sidescroler with an amazing story. Also to top it of very nice replayability. I would reccomend this to everyone who likes a good RPG Really good Metroidvania type game. The gameplau has a bit of a feel of Cave Story plus Dark Souls to me with tight combat that often requires thought put into the situation you come up against. Besides all the this the great pixel art graphics, atmospheric soundtrack, and mysterious but interesting story help it be an even better full experience than just a bunch of good gameplay. This game is way better than i though it would be. It\\'s an exellent 2D action adventure. Incredible pixel art and animation. Great level and game design. Fantastic music and atmosphere. Probably one of the best metroidvania like games I\\'ve played in the last couple of years. If you like metroidvania games.. well, what are you waiting for !?!???... Seriously, it is a very good game. I bought this game on a whim months ago and never touched it, but I decided to give it a chance.\\n\\nAbsolutely no regrets. It\\'s a phenomenal game and I wish I had played it sooner. The pixel art is great (especially the bosses and water effects), the gameplay is incredibly challenging but rewarding to learn, and the music is pretty decent as well. If you are looking for a good metroidvania style game, you\\'ve found it. The only real downside is that the game is fairly short, but that\\'s helped by its high replay value, with such optional challenges as a pacifist run or killing all the bosses without taking damage. \\n\\nIn short, buy this game; I\\'m sure you\\'ll enjoy it. I suck at this game 10/10 Top quality metroidvania game !\\n Best metroidvania I\\'ve played in a long while. The aesthetics are through the roof and the gameplay is tight/satisfying. Hard mode is actually fairly challenging as well and I\\'ve been having fun playing though it. If you\\'re like me and you always feel like there simply aren\\'t enough good games in this genre, I highly encourage you to buy this immediately. I\\'m pretty positive you won\\'t be disappointed. Good game \\n\\n9/10\\ntoo short Great little game made with a lot of heart. Solid attention to detail in level design and atmosphere. Surprisingly good amount of memorable characters and bosses, and a varied and excellent soundtrack to back it up. Not much else to say, it\\'s a game that stands solidly within its own identity while taking inspiration from genre greats like Metroid and Dark Souls, and it doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. . 8-bit dark souls basically, really fleshed out with unique enemies and fun boss fights. need I say more? \\n I have no idea what to say. The game is strongly recommended. Momodora is a well realized Metroidvania-lite.  Progression is not tied to unlocking new movement abilities, but in progressing through areas and defeating the bosses that dwell in them.  There is a light inventory and ability management system that serves to enhance the tight and enjoyable combat.  I recommend a controller, as this game requires precise control in combat and platforming.  For those of you who like a challenge, the bosses reward perfect gameplay with diffuclt to obtain items and enhancements. \\n\\nGraphically the game is beautiful.  The spritework is some of the best I\\'ve seen, and the environments are varied and interesting.  \\n\\nLength wise the game could be completed in one or two solid nights of game play.  \\n\\nI recommend anyone who enjoys the Metroidvania genre to give this game a try. The story telling in this game is like-for-like Dark Souls, and I love that vague, cryptic style of story telling, especially when it\\'s dark fantasy. With an amalgamation of Dark Souls and Metroidvanyia elements, smooth, fast combat, and challenging bosses with good phases and patterns, it\\'s hard not to recemmond this game. The developers did a grade A job with this one. Beautiful Pixelart\\nAwesome Gameplay\\nFunny Boss Momodora is an excellent 2D action platformer packed with challenges. The game is short (5h or so) but it doesn\\'t need to be longer, it delivers exactly what you want in that time. I absolutely recommend it for those who love Metroidvania games. Best 10 dollar game I\\'ve ever played hands down. Highly reccomended if ya like metroid+dark souls combined. Exactly what I want from a Metroidvania. This is a really good game and its loads of fun and the music is amazing and also the art work 10/10 Gorgeus art with gameplay that requires skill in harder difficulties. My first playthrough (and so far only) was on hard. In the beginning it was annoying to die in one or two hits, but as I played I got better and could defeat bosses without taking damage.\\nThere\\'s also wide variety of different items to go with your play style, I personally went for items that increased my damage. This game is beautiful without a doubt. A mustbuy for platformer fans who want a good challenge! Not a bad metroidvania. a little easy and short but the art is very nice. 6/10 I don\\'t know where to begin.\\n\\nBeautiful art.\\nGreat gameplay.\\nFun bosses.\\n\\nAn impressive little gem. [b]The review featured below can be seen with glorious images and captions on[/b] [url=https://voxludicus.com/2016/07/03/review-momodora-reverie-under-the-moonlight/]Vox Ludicus[/url][b] - below, everything but them.[/b]\\n\\nReverie Under the Moonlight is the fourth entry in the Momodora series, a fast-paced action game which clearly draws from games such as Metroid, Cave Story and Dark Souls. Within a genre that the developers have been working on for the past years, the question that I asked myself when I first went into the game – having only played Momodora III before – was how much of an identity it managed to have. Here’s what I found out.\\n\\nThe first thing that I have to mention are the aesthetics of the game: from the detailed pixel art and varied animations given to each interaction and creature in the game, to the lush backgrounds and appropriately haunting soundtrack, there’s much to praise in both the game’s style and the cohesion of its elements. Nothing feels out of place, and the bizarre characters you’ll find – from speaking skeletons to rude imps and talking cats – all add up to contribute toward the worldbuilding and lore of the series.\\n\\nIn terms of gameplay, Momodora contrasts with most of its genre brethren – if you were to classify it as a MetroidVania – due to its inherent simplicity. There are two types of attack – a melee attack with your sacred maple leaf, which you can chain up to three times; and a ranged attack, with a bow, that you can charge to shoot in multiple directions or to fire rapid volleys of arrows. Combat is slick and unforgiving, with Kaho unable to take more than a few hits before dying, and the boss fights were particularly entertaining, as I had to switch between bow and leaf regularly, dodging projectiles all the while, with the added incentive of bosses dropping special items if you defeat them without getting hit. You start the game with the ability to double jump and dash, which grants you invulnerability frames, and in terms of navigational capacity you won’t unlock much: only a cat form, which allows you to access smaller places; and an aerial dash, which makes platforming and fighting easier without actually opening up any new areas.\\n\\nThe other items and collectibles you can find are either generic, such as slight increases to your health pool, ivory bugs you can exchange for items or additional bellflowers (the game’s potion, or estus flask given it replenishes at save points), or non-game-changing – from active items that allow you to summon damaging winds and protective spheres to passive ones that make your arrows poisonous or increase your leaf’s damage. Since they don’t open new locations or drastically change the way you play the game, going after these is entirely optional. This makes Reverie Under the Moonlight a game light on backtracking – it took me just under twelve hours to 100% the map, find all the items and collect all the ivory bugs, done in two playthroughs, and you can expect your first, regular playthrough to last anywhere between four and six hours.\\n\\nAside from finding everything in the game, beating it on hard mode unlocks the insane difficulty, which makes everything kill you in one hit. Conversely, if you’re not fond of challenges you can turn it down from normal to easy. While the game itself is rather lean, it encourages multiple playthroughs by means of different endings and the higher difficulties.\\n\\nIn terms of story, Reverie Under the Moonlight is a patchwork of different tales and stories – told by the world’s inhabitants you meet – and never does it get any clearer than cryptic. A curse has settled in the city and its surrounding areas, and because of it many people are suffering – including those of your village – and as the High Priestess of Lun it’s your job to seek out the Queen and find a way to seal this curse. I found it borrowed a lot from Dark Souls’ way of storytelling, with little explicitly told to you but much to find out in the item descriptions and optional dialogues. There’s also a huge bell you can hit at the top of a tower.\\n\\nIt’s by merit of the mysterious, dark world and its no filler design that Reverie Under the Moonlight carves out a spot in a genre that’s known for lengthy affairs and complex, backtracking-intensive maps. This is also the fourth game in the series, and it shows: gone are the clearly Cave Story-inspired graphics and designs, replaced by a new, exclusive artstyle that’s great to look at, specially when in motion, and as good looking as the series has ever been. It’s short enough that it doesn’t lose momentum, but by the time I had finished it twice I felt like it had content in just the right measure, and enough of a challenge in its core gameplay that I enjoyed the process of learning each section and boss fight until I knew it by heart. For those fond of Cave Story, Metroid or Castlevania games and even Dark Souls, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game I absolutely urge you to play. A wonderful hidden gem that seemingly came out of no where!\\n\\nLike most others, I had never heard of Momodora before stumbling upon this game. Looked at the trailer and a few pictures and I was already sold. Started the game and played a few minutes and I was already in love with it.\\n\\nThis game is very simple and elegant. It looks gorgeous and it\\'s very beautifully animated. It\\'s satisfying to control, easy to pick up and somewhat difficult to master. However, although the learning curve is a bit steep at first, it stagnates quickly enough and becomes fairly easy. I completed the game on normal difficulty and although I did have a harder time the first few bosses, the game became increasingly easy to me.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a massive game but it doesn\\'t try to sell you something it isn\\'t. It is reminescent of Dark Souls in a few aspects without trying to be Dark Souls either. Enemies can be pretty tough and you get punished for being reckless. Bosses are pretty tough most of the time and you have to be patient and dodge attacks carefully. You have save points which heal you and replenish your healing items and doors that \"Do not open from this side\". The game is also non-linear, which sort of explains why the difficulty doesn\\'t change much.\\n\\nThe map is not particularly big but it was very fun to explore, the game is not very long but you definitely get your money\\'s worth. There are also a bunch of hidden stuff all around, which might encourage you to complete more than one playthrough.\\n\\nThere is very little story but it\\'s perfect the way it is. You get small tidbits of dialogue that put you in context from time to time, without drowning you in pointless hours backstory.\\n\\nI feel like I could very well have played this game on the SNES back then. It feels oldschool but also shares a few more modern design choices, which makes a very good mix in my opinion.\\n\\nDefinitely recommended this game to anyone that likes metroidvania style games, platformers, A-RPG, that sort of stuff. One of my favorite discoveries this year! I love the game. I had fun, and I believe that was the point. Now I feel compeled to play the other Momodora games. Dark Souls with waifus One of the best platformer games ive played in a long time, i recomend this to anyone who loves the good old platforming games! I first had seen this game during the summer games done quick 2016 event ran by halfcoordinated, and decided to try it out myself. The games atmosphere, music, and graphics are beautiful and amazing, game has alot of exploration to do as well as challenging enemies and bosses. very fun game! <3 :D Fun and short. The games difficulty ranges from decent challange to easy mode depending on how much you want to cheese the combat. The difficulty spikes way too much after the 1st boss as I show in this video  https://youtu.be/SZ3GnMzl2GU\\n\\nI honestly like the graphics and attacks (Charge with bow, sword attack and double jump), but sadly they have wizards firing through walls and 2 shots kill you, so it\\'s impossible for me to fight these wolves while dodging wizard blasts, especially when they are out of range; they\\'re cheaper than Mario\\'s Hammer Bros. The roll doesn\\'t really help much as you are fighting wolves in the meantime. You are also vulnerable for a moment while trying to heal and the healing item is only good for recovering 1 hit, making it completely pointless if a wizard is gunning for you when you use it. A relatively short but challenging game with great mechanics and replayability. One of my favourite games this year. Luuuuv it. Da graphics, da plot, everything dat ya would wish fur. \\n\\nWishful Thinkin? This game is a metroidvania. You side scroll through a large 2D map unlocking access to new areas by gaining new powers. It sticks to the genre tropes pretty strongly, but it does them well so there\\'s no problem here.\\n\\nReverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th game in the Momodora series (or something like that, I\\'m not totally sure). That being said, you don\\'t need to play the previous games to enjoy this one.\\n\\nThe sprite art is really well done. It\\'s very easy to tell what everything is by looking at it. The soundtrack is nice to listen to. It isn\\'t particularly memorable, but it sets the mood well for the tone of the game.\\n\\nThis game has a lot of backtracking, but thankfully you gain the ability to warp between certain save points so secret finding isn\\'t a slog through stuff you\\'ve already done 100 times.\\n\\nThe combat is well built. It especially shines during boss fights. You will be tested by the bosses. Thankfully your health items regenerate at every save point so you don\\'t need to go grinding out more potions every time you die to a boss.\\n\\nI recommend this game because it has solid polish and it succeeds at doing what it sets out to do. Short but sweet metroidvania game. Well, from the get go, you\\'re gonna realise Momodora: RUtM takes its inspiration much from Dark Souls; it\\'s got quite the difficulty to it, forcing you to take advantage of invincibility-frames with your dodge rolls, learning patters of your enemies, and deciding how you\\'re going to face all of your enemies; cautiously & patiently, or going ham-sandwich. I saw the game over screen a healthy amount of times mostly because you just can\\'t run into the game and hack\\'n\\'slash your way through.\\n\\nMomodora\\'s got a pretty nice soundtrack, and a nice set of boss battles to keep you entertained. The visuals and sprites are animated so beautifully, too. It\\'s very \\'Metroidvania\\', so if you\\'re just not advancing at all, you probably aren\\'t supposed to be there yet, and all of these upgrades just speed up the pacing of the game in a satifying way.\\n\\nHad no idea how to get true ending btw had to google it, but I give it a 79/43. It\\'s great. Charming, clever, and gorgeous. Not terribly long, but a good Metroidvania doesn\\'t have to be. Controls are very responsive, but your attacks have a lot of heft to them, so you can\\'t just spam your way through everything. Also does a good job of \"showing not telling\" the story, which I think is particularly important in games like this. Secret bonus items for beating bosses flawlessly add some interesting replayability, and possibly some speedrunning depth, too. You won\\'t regret picking this up. [b]Game status at time of review:[/b]\\nCompleted the game with over 95% map completion and unlocked the \"True Ending\" achievement. I\\'ve started a NewGame+ but have not progressed far.\\nTime played: 6 hours.\\n\\n[b]Quick Score[/b]: 6 out of 10. A capable \"Metroidvania\" with solid atmosphere and respectable challenge. A little shorter than expected, but it doesn\\'t wear out its welcome either which I think is equally important. You\\'ll have a fun weekend with it, and you could spend $9.99 on a lot worse.\\n\\n----\\n\\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\\nThe gameplay is decent. You move, jump and attack at a pleasant speed. Collision detection is spot on. Dodging seems finicky at first, but it\\'s just one of those nuances you\\'ll get used to before long. Attacking also causes your character to move forward, so unless you\\'re careful you\\'ll find yourself stepping into enemies too often. I also feel like jumping from ladders should have given you more height, as traversing them tends to feel a bit tedious. Those are really my only complaints.\\n\\nThere are a few hidden traps here and there but nothing that isn\\'t telegraphed relatively well, and certainly none of those cheap instant deaths that seem to be all the rage these days. It would have been easy to include some of them and try to pass this off as more \"souls-like\", so I\\'m glad they didn\\'t. Likewise, it would have been incredibly easy to throw character levels / experience system or stat-based progression and I\\'m [b]extremely[/b] thankful they didn\\'t. That alone made the game much more palatable, so if you\\'re one of those people who absolutely [i]needs[/i] bars to fill or statistics to calculate, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nAs a quick note, I liked the item-based approach, though I ended with over 5k \"Munney\". It seemed like a lot of single-use or limited-use items that would have just cluttered up the heal / ability menu to me, so I didn\\'t buy them. The Passives were okay, nothing to write home about, and I\\'m glad there wasn\\'t just a \"moar gooder\" option that became the automatic default. I do have to point out that the ring that alerts you to when there\\'s a secret hidden on the screen is always a welcome addition to games like this and I was pleased to find it was given out early. It could have used a little more variety in the items but what was there was solid.\\n\\n[b]World / Level Design: [/b]\\nI\\'d say slightly above average; not a lot of tedious \"snake\" hallways that Metroidvanias are notorious for. There weren\\'t a lot of really [i]clever[/i] rooms, but what\\'s there is solid. Not a tremendous amount of backtracking, but players who are out to check every corner will find themselves having to circle back to check the path not taken. Enemy placement is handled nicely, and there\\'s a variety of them as well. A decent amount of boss fights, none of which are particularly cheap; I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.\\n\\nA good number of secrets, but not so many that you\\'ll grow weary of tracking them down. There were quite a few \"I am an obvious mystery, come back later!\" points, with no real inclination to come back later. Now that I\\'ve started a NewGame+, I\\'m seeing a few places where I\\'m thinking \"Oh yeah, I never did come back to see what random character on the log wanted.\" Your millage may vary but it seems like finding every little thing isn\\'t worth it.\\n\\n[b]Visuals:[/b]\\nThe art style is fine, resting somewhere between the NES\\' limited pallete and SNES\\' sprite and animation. The levels do lack a little variety; outside of the starting area and one other exception, it tends to stick fairly heavily to dark, gothic spaces, but it makes sense in the context of the story. Animation is very nice, especially for the bow attacks.\\n\\nIt [i]is[/i] little too \"anime\" for my tastes. I was initially turned off from the game by the trailer, which showed a giant undead anime girl boss with a pair of overly aniamted breasts. Awkward. Having actually played it, that sort of thing is actually fairly minimal (though I have to point out the giving the undead girl boss breasts that [i]very visibly[/i] bounce around when you attack them, something no other boss does, kicked up my squick factor more than a little). Having said that, if you have a tolerance for that sort of thing, you\\'ll be fine, and I\\'ve honestly played games with worse (Shantae, for example, is wall-to-wall fanservice). At least it doesn\\'t feel as out of place as the post Dawn of Sorrow Castlevania games.\\n\\n[b]Audio:[/b]\\nThe starting area is probably the only area where the music really has any impact, and after that it\\'s mostly just atmospheric, with a few notes here and there. It doesn\\'t really have a lot of character, I\\'m sorry to say, but again, I get what they were going for. Boss themes are sufficient to get you in the right mood. \\n\\nSound effects are decent enough, with solid audio cues (you\\'ll quickly learn to identify when there\\'s one of the \\'caster\\' enemies nearby). Nothing too obnoxious (the starting area has some enemies that bounce around making annoyingly high-pitched squeaks though). You\\'ll likely get a little tired of the scream your character makes on death.\\n\\n[b]Storyline:[/b]\\nI\\'m not sure if this is the latest in a series of games, but it doesn\\'t seem to matter. The storyline sticks to the NES school of storytelling; you\\'re here, you have a thing to do, occationally you run into other characters who flesh out the world through short blurbs, but for the most part you\\'re left to your own devices. No annoying cut-scenes, long-winded dialogue boxes or omnipresent narration. You get a general sense of the world and how various elements fit within it, but you don\\'t need to pay it any attention and it doesn\\'t intrude.\\n\\n[b]Replayability:[/b]\\nI can see myself circling around to give this another go in a few months; there\\'s still a few rooms I didn\\'t discover, I didn\\'t grab all of the Ivory Bugs collectables (of which there are only 20 total, which seems a [i]shockingly[/] resonable number in this day and age).\\n\\nThanks for reading. It\\'s like Dark souls, Castlevania and Cave story had a orgee.\\n10/10 would kill people with a leaf again. I first found this game through Horikawa Otane, a YouTube Let\\'s Player. I fell in love with the graphics at first sight, and had to check it out for myself. I booted up the game, but didn\\'t feel motivated to continue playing past the first few screens after dying multiple times, something uncharacteristic of me. I think it was because the game felt incredibly calm and serene, something that I was not accustomed to playing. But after pushing myself to get past at least the first boss, I became enthralled with the story, not to mention that I was also finally comfortable with the character movements and other game mechanics. I highly recommend this game for those who love 2D platforming with a metroidvania feel to it. I really recommend this video game. Momodora is a cute, charming game that provides plenty of hours of good fun platforming and exploration. It has a perfect combination of being challenging without being stressful. You (hopefully) won\\'t spend more than a few attempts at any given boss. The narrative is simple yet enjoyable in an atmosphere that is sure to keep you smiling through the whole game! The art style is just as smooth as the mechanics of the game. It\\'s really rekindled my love for the metroidvania genre and it has earned my inital purchase and any sequel that comes after. \\n\\n I didnt enjoy an indie game for a very long time\\nsatisfied Avery good evolution to momodora games\\n-it has more elements added that resemble dark souls elements\\n-hard mode means you dead in 1 hit son\\n-great game\\n\\nit looks gorgeous\\n 2D Bloodborne with many of the great features of a true metroidvania, I couldn\\'t put it down from beginning to end. Also some of the greatest pixel work and most attractive character designs I\\'ve seen in a game like this.\\n\\nHighly Recommended. A short but sweet game. It\\'s a true metroidvania, heavily inspired by Castlevania with its dark stylings. \\n\\nThe controls are solid and getting around and exploring is fairly straight forward and intuitive, though the game could have used more depth. You get a few usable items (which are restored when saving) and you can purchase a number of accessories with passive effects\\n\\nPerhaps where it shines most is the boss fights, which are challenging but not ridiculously tough (at least not on \"normal\" difficulty\").\\n\\nThe pixel art and animation are good. The music sounds more modern, and has more of a toned down ambient sound.\\n\\nIt only takes a few hours to complete but there are items to collect and it does have a sort of New Game+ mode. Overall I was pretty happy with this purchase. Momodora RUtM is a metroidvania, souls-like game, and It is absolutely amazing.\\n\\nThe art and sound is beautiful, and the gameplay is tight and natural feeling. It\\'s a great purchase, and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for an engaging world and straight forward story, as well as a great challenge. Great game in the Metroidvania style, excellent tight controls and beatiful pixel art. good shit An excellent metroidvania experience with strong influences from the Souls series, all wrapped in a beautifully constructed pixel world with a fantastic soundtrack.\\n\\nWell worth the money, especially if you want a challenge.\\n\\n(Don\\'t play it on Easy, there is literally no point). Full price or on sale,this game is good so you wont be disapointed for purchasing.The devs have come along quite a bit with this newest title and it shows.More like this and I couldn\\'t be happier.Gameplay of course is metroidvania and the bosses can be tough but as you progress and get new items you can work your way around and kick some arse.Storyline is simple but haunting and the music,sound effects,create a perfect atmosphere for playing.I give it a perfect 10/10 for me,I am sure you will enoy it as much also. cool little metroid inspired game with a very smooth pixel animation and artstyle. Good Metroidvania title. Great game with fantastic art and music. A bit short, bout 7 hours on my first playthrough on hard, but has good replay value. This game is short, yet sweet. There\\'s a little bit of replay value with unlocking the achievements, but aside from that, not much unless you plan on speed running. \\n\\nMy only complaint with the game, is that for some reason, the soundtrack dlc is missing the track for Sacred Ordalia Grove and I can\\'t find the file ANYWHERE. It\\'s really a shame because that\\'s my favorite song from the game :( An incredibly solid metroid-like with some nice impactful combat and challenging bosses. Thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game. Short and sweet. Great art. I came in fully expecting this game to be amazing but it only took me 18 minutes to realize it might be the worst game I\\'ve played in years.  There was barely any real difficulty to be found but the fake difficulty was near constant. Nearly every enemy had a shield that you\\'re supposed to roll through so you can attack \\'em from behind but sometimes the enemies turn around instantly so that doesn\\'t work & then you get knifed or you bump into the enemy because your attacks make you move for no reason & the enemy didn\\'t budge because you hit their shield because they unexpectedly turned around instantly. Combine this with the fact that those enemies usually come in groups of 2 or more & they throw knives with infinite range even from offscreen & it\\'s insanely unfair. I died about 3 times to collision damage &, once, I died to poison because pushing Y made me strike a pose instead of using my healing item.\\n\\nNormally, I\\'m willing to accept that kind of unfairness because most games don\\'t do that kind of thing often enough to kill me 4 times in 18 minutes.\\n\\nAlso, at one point a spider showed up but, instead of attacking, it said \"Uguuu....\" like it was in pain & did nothing so I figured it might be friendly. I approached it & nothing happened. I pushed buttons but nothing happened. I walked into it & got hurt by collision damage but nothing happened. I pushed the attack button but that predictably made me attack it which caused it to involuntarily swing & hurt me with collision damage. With nothing else left to try, I murdered it but nothing happened. The moment I\\'ve murdered a harmless NPC because I was out of options to try with that NPC & I don\\'t even know whether or not killing it was bad, the writing has failed.\\n\\nI even tried Bulletwitch for about an hour before I gave up on it but this game is so willfully bad that I don\\'t even know why I gave it 18 minutes. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is the best in the series. As usual, the game has taken the things that worked in the previous games and gone ahead to try and improve. It has been a delight to watch and play this series as it has evolved over the years.\\n\\nThis game is mainly a platformer with a soulish feel to it as it features hidden walls, tough bosses, and challenging gameplay. Further examples include,  the \\'bell flower\\' which serves the same purpose as the \\'estus\\' and the prayer bells which are essentially the bonfires. However thats about it for the similarities, Momodora is less punishing and there is even a choice of difficulty from the begininning. \\n\\nLike in the previous games the platforming is solid but unlike the previous games you actually start off with the double jump this time around which was pretty cool.\\nThe sound design is as good as the previous games perhaps a step up if anyhting. You will definetly be appreciating the tunage as you play.\\nThe creator has improved the aesthetic and made this one look the best in the series, the 16bit graphics are phenominal and the colour palette is very mood; Colorful but washed out is the best way I could describe it. The characters are taller this time around too, which is a welcome change.\\nThe metroidvania in this game is more present than the 3rd game which indifferently to the series level design tried to be more linear.\\n\\nThis game is truly fun and worth the money. I recommend.\\n\\n9/10 It would be nice if we could get the option to change aspect ratio to 16:9.\\n\\nAside from that, it\\'s a really fun game. I enjoyed everything about it. Slapped a giant witch\\'s boobs with a maple leaf. 10/10 Lovely game with smooth control and reasonable combat. I caressed a witch\\'s giant boobs with a leaf gently, 10/10 Awesome game, I got to demo it at Pax East and was hooked immediately. It\\'s a nice metroidvania game with tight controls, beautiful art, a nice story and is kinda like a 2D bloodborne. I enjoyed it a lot and will certainly give it another play through. IF you are a fan of metroidvania and difficulty (such as dark souls). I would highly suggest this game. My favorite side-scroller since dawn of sorrow I\\'m writing this review very shortly after completing my first playthrough of the game. This gameplay experience was captivating enough for me that I\\'ve put Momodora III on my wishlist, and shortly intend to complete one or two more playthroughs of RUTM.\\n\\nI\\'m a very large fan of Metroidvania style games, and this particular title is an exemplary model of one. Gorgeous aesthetics, natural controls, and a sense of fulfillment from both challenging combat and expansive exploration are what you should expect coming into this game. My *minor* gripes include wishing there was more narrative with the story telling, and a greater focus on challenging platforming, but as a whole I would still highly recommend this title.\\n\\nFor that first gripe, it isn\\'t as if there isn\\'t plenty of story in the game; there is a lot left for you to infer based on dialogue with characters and environmental hints. This is actually rather par for the course with many Metroidvania style games, and in a sense I\\'m thankful that RUTM didn\\'t weigh down it\\'s incredible tight gameplay with unnecessary plot dump. With some distinct pages taken out of the Dark Souls series\\' book (illusory walls, to name just one), I feel that taking another hint from those games and implementing some more in-depth item descriptions would\\'ve helped enhance the story and perhaps give further incentive for completion of optional tasks and areas. That\\'s just a \"what if\" though, and I would say I\\'m very much so content with how the story played out in the game - please don\\'t let this musing be a detterent!\\n\\nThe platforming on the other hand did leave a little to be desired. Do take this with a grain of salt, however, as I would consider myself quite versed with Metroidvania games, but my personal taste would have seen more challenging platforming and navigation. This isn\\'t so much in regards to the map as a whole - it was sufficiently maze-like and open ended with optional areas, but rather I felt a lack of challenge in regards to navigating particular rooms. Again, there was plenty of enjoyable challenge with *combat* in those rooms with various creatures and enemies, but I suppose the best way I could put this was there wasn\\'t a single time where I was stuck in a room and actually had to stop and think about how to proceed. On the other hand, this could be seen as a positive by other gamers, given how puzzles in other Metroidvania games could be needlessly complex or just there to slow down your progress. I\\'d like to clarify that this *isn\\'t a negative on the game* as far as I\\'m concerned, rather just personal taste, and I\\'m highly confident that anyone else who likes Metroidvanias shouldn\\'t be bothered by this either.\\n\\nNow that I have my two \"issues\" with the game out of the way, I\\'d like to reiterate that I\\'ve very much enjoyed RUTM. It\\'s gorgeous design for both characters and environments immediately hooked me, and I was appreciative of the strong level of detail throughout. Combined with a strong soundtrack and audio design for the various areas, this game is very easily able to set the mood and keep your interest. In addition, from the very beginning, the controls feel very intuitive for both movement and combat. I\\'m sure that both newer players and those more experienced with Metroidvania style games should find themselves at home with controlling Kaho. \\n\\nI touched upon it earlier, but there\\'s shades of Dark Souls in this combat, given the commitment to actions including attacking and dodging, as well as having a myriad of equipable items that alter your offensive and defensive options, all of which I feel rewards skill development and learning your preferred playstyle. It\\'s another reason I\\'m interested in playing through the game again - in order to take on various enemies and bosses with different items and strategies. (Okay, let\\'s be honest, I actually just want more Lubella in my life.)\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game that, in spite of my minor gripes, is thankfully not overly complex, yet also accomplishes so much with its design. I\\'m incredibly satisfied with my gaming experience so far with just my first playthrough, and I\\'m sure my subsequent playthroughs will make me appreciate this game all the more. For anyone looking for either a solid challenge, a gorgeous looking game, something to try and speedrun, or just really likes [spoiler]kitties[/spoiler], this is a game you should **absolutely** add to your Steam library! [h1]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/h1]\\nThis is a great metroidvania!\\nOne of the best game I ever played!\\nAtmosphere is awesome, and pixel graphic is pretty good!\\nAnd other games from Momodora series are awesome,\\nAll the characters are nice. \\nI gues you better find it out by yourself.\\nThe plot is fantastic and masterpiece!\\n\\n[h1] 9.5/10[/h1] Creepy, Difficult, Platformer, Good Soundtracks... Thats all i need to enjoy a game. This game is a lot of fun, so if you like 2d platforming games you should try this one. The atmosphere of the game reminds me of the RPGmaker horror game Ib, which I love.\\n\\nEdit: Just finished the game and got the Final Ending. Must say this game is one of the best 2D platformers I\\'ve ever played in my life! This game is a must for all 2D platforming fans! Excelent game. Tight controls, gorgeous music and visual style, charismatic characters and quite unpredictable turn of events in the storyline. If you\\'re a fan of platformers in general, I can\\'t recommend this game enough. A 4-5 hour long love affair. What a game. Sublime execution in terms of the world building and game mechanics with the most charming visual style. For everyone who crave for the solid metroidvania experience with some twists. \\n\\nPros\\n* Graphics and style. \\n* Interesting characters.\\n* Bosses.\\n* Things to collect without boring backtracking.\\n\\nCons\\n* Short.\\n* Some of the equpment is useless in the context of the game. 30 minutes in some vendor offers you an artifact that basically tells you where every secret in the map is. \\n\\nSorry but if I wanted to have my hand held like that I\\'d buy a AAA game, at least the graphics would be better. \\n\\nPros\\nThe game is very similair to the megaman ZX games. \\n\\nCons\\nOnce you get to 50-60% map completion it is very easy to get lost. Finding what you have to do next is like finding a needle in a haystack. \\n\\n\\n\\nSidenote: not dark souls/not castlevania Super fun game\\nTight controls \\nMemorable boss fights, yet some are really easy\\nBeautiful sprites\\nSome of the best settings I\\'ve seen recently in gaming\\nFeels overall very thought out and loved, you can tell the devs put a lot of soul into this game Cute 2D Souls. Soundtrack is amazing, character models are great and the gameplay is well tuned! Only wish I could have more. The HYPE is all true, sadly the only complaint I have is the length of this gem! ALL GOOD.I want OST lossless version download. In a post-Shovel Knight era, it\\'s hard to look at the \"Indie\" label without a scrupulous eye for game design that doesn’t merely leverage on nostalgia nor old-school aesthetics. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th installment of a series of games developed by Guilherme Martins “rdein” that demonstrates how far a developer could go just from learning and improving upon a solid foundation and refining its execution, regardless of looks. At first glance, it might seem like another action exploration platformer in the same vein as Guacamelee, Super Metroid and post-Symphony of the Night Castlevania titles (often referred to as metroidvania). In fact, it shares more in common with the classic style Castlevania than, as others might claim, Dark Souls. Despite all semblances, Reverie manages to feel fresh and engaging; it doesn’t feel like just a mishmash of the aforementioned games. It manages to carve its own identity using the series own roots as a basis.\\n\\nThe Momodora games started out as action adventure games that bear more similarities to Daisuke “pixel” Amaya’s indie hit game Cave Story. The first game, in particular, shared similar super-deformed aesthetics as its source inspiration with the main character taking up the width and height of one in-game block. The game had a more linear focus with regards to its level design. Numerous weapon pickups were available, but the most apparent was the magic leaf that Isadora, the protagonist, wields as her primary melee attack as she desperately finds a way to revive her mother from mortality. This becomes one of the defining traits of the series continuing with the second game, Momodora II: Once again playing a female protagonist wielding a maple leaf, this time a girl named Momo, you’re out to hunt for the Undead Queen. Progression has been expanded upon to that of a standard metroidvania with ability based upgrades along with a more open world design. The presentation itself has taken an upgrade, and players would save and restore health in the now series-familiar prayer bells. By the 3rd game, players could choose to play either as Momo or Isadora, with boss battles becoming a prominent highlight, doubling in number from the previous installment. Momodora III opts for a more solid palette of colors accompanied with a cleaner design, showcasing more nuanced sprite animation than its predecessors. This is helped by the variety of environments with its distinct set of vibrant palettes.\\n\\nAll of these aspects coalesce resulting in this latest entry. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight has the open-world design of Momodora II, the equipable item ability from Momodora III, and a protagonist who was merely hinted in lore from the previous games. You play as Kaho, a priestess hailing from the village of Lum, seeking a way to stop a curse from spreading to her homeland by traversing the Kingdom of Karst. Like its predecessors, themes of death and the sending off of spirits once again crop up. Not only does it feel darker in tone, but Reverie leverages on its evolved presentation, with the primary cast and non-playable characters represented in a less abbreviated stature than in the former games, putting more focus on positioning, dodging, and chaining attacks, with environmental and enemy placement feeling more dense, focused, and compact. Every screen prepares the player to be on their toes for an encounter, as seldom are there just rooms which merely serve as vistas for items and NPCs: While previous games in the series are no stranger to emphasizing enemy placement, Reverie does pull new tricks up its sleeve with regards to diversity and how they control the space within the screen, as often times one might feel pinned down in an inopportune spot, yet never does it feel unfair. Unlike preceding games, Kaho can now roll to get behind enemies to hit them from behind and pass otherwise undodgeable attacks unscathed. Combat is also more nuanced and meaty; there is a sense of weight to each stroke of the leaf Kaho unleashes and even the arrows she fires has a nice sense of swiftness, and all of this is mesmerizingly animated by the wonderful sprite work with a wide breath of expressiveness. Controlling the game not only look great, but feels right.\\n\\nReverie features a handful of entertaining and challenging boss battles. New to the series are obtaining items from bosses upon defeating them without getting hit (A similar reward mechanism is also present in Mega Man Zero 2). While these items are not prerequisite to obtaining the true ending of the game, many who feel the urge to get 100% completion (or are just obsessive compulsive like me) might find this feat particularly daunting, especially for first-time playthroughs. Luckily, a New Game + mode unlocks upon completion of the game and retains all your collectibles and most of your upgrades including your completed map, allowing to set oneself properly for the encounter ahead.\\n\\nIn terms of scope and design, Reverie’s open-world has a nicely knit network of areas that, while large, never feels overwhelming; backtracking is alleviated by some smart design choices, and retraversing sections to get from one screen to the next never felt like a chore. The map itself not only houses a handful of secrets, but places them in areas which make backtracking feel rewarding (This is not an easy feat to pull off, as many developers would sometimes keep upgrades and ability items as a sole reason to backtrack, not in-spite of). To help with matters, much like in Momodora III, prayer bells would eventually let you warp back to previously explored areas. Exploring 100% of the world is not that difficult a task, but the game itself is by no means too short.\\n\\nWhich brings us to Reverie’s overall length: After traversing 7 unique areas, the game never overstays its welcome and ends right before things begin feeling rote. Even despite repeated playthroughs, there are so many approaches one could take thanks to its non-linear progression: After the first boss, it is possible to beat consecutive bosses in any order which you see fit. The abilities you gain from each defeated boss can be subsequently used to your advantage in any other boss fight, creating a form of Mega Man style effect of boss progression. It is also possible to beat the game without defeating a single common enemy (known in-game as a Pacifist run), or try for the Insane difficulty that leaves you to perish in one hit; These are more bragging rights rewards than anything, but the fact that the game can be played and completed in either fashion shows how much thought went into its design.\\n\\nIf one is interested in wanting to see how far a single designer could take their idea by learning from each iteration, the Momodora series would be considered a textbook example of how to refine a franchise: Taking inspirations from various games, learning to experiment and keep what works, trim what doesn’t, while holding steadfast to the core principles, which in this case, is a maple leaf.\\n A Metroidvania with some Soulsborne elements, including replenishing healing items at save points, high difficulty, and saddening, ambiguous endings that are sometimes difficult to get to.  The art style is gorgeous, and has a strange dichotomy of cute and eldritch that works. Gameplay is rather standard Metroidvania, with various exploration and combat abilities gained as you advance through the game. Criticisms include ambigious i-frames while dodge-rolling, ocassional difficulty determining what areas are instant-death falls and what are not, and a few moments of ambiguity around foreground and background areas. Please play. I don\\'t get why some people compare this game to the souls/bloodborne series, as they have nothing (except maybe the healing system) in common. It\\'s not because a game is \"hard\" that it looks like dark souls....\\n\\nTalking about the game : Momodora is a classic metroidvania, you operate on a labyrinthine castle and reveal the map gradually, gain new powers that allow you to discover new areas etc.\\n\\nIt\\'s a really good game, due to his atmosphere, his beautiful music and decor. The gameplay is fast and nervous (you really feel the impacts when you hit).\\n\\nIf you like game like old castlevania, just buy and play it, you won\\'t be disappointed. If you liked Castlevania SOTN, you will absolutely want to play this game! Its Beautiful, has good sound but for a semi casual like me the difficulty is to much. Very fun game. Quite challenging for newcomers to the Metroidvania genre. Have not played any other games in the series but this one makes me very interested in the world and characters. First playthrough and beat within 5 hours so a bit on the short side but that\\'s the only strike against a very solid and beautiful metroidvania. Can\\'t wait for the next one. You get to be a cat and go searching for bugs. One of the best metroidvainia games i have played in a long time! \\nBeautiful sprite work, and soundtrack!\\nFelt like an instant classic\\nI had a hard time putting this game down before i finished it!\\nPlayed through on Normal had a decent amount of challenge, cant wait to try Hard\\n\\nOnly bad thing i could say about it, is it felt a little short.\\n\\nP.S. Found out after beating it that its the fourth in the series of Momodora games!\\nKeep rockin guys! I have not finished this game yet, but so far I would definitely recommend this game.The art style, atmosphere and feel are terriffic, control is pretty tight (though I really wish I could use my ps4 controller natively). The challenge of the game is pretty moderate, it feels like an older Castevania title.  Looking forward to spending more time with this title to finish it, this is a fun game and feel this is a studio worth investing in by buying their game(s). Fantastic and beautiful metroidvania with some Dark Souls influence. Combat and platforming are both fluid and responsive, and there is a good variety of items and spells to play around with. NG+ also mixes up some of the enemy spawn locations, so it\\'s a little different for your second playthrough. Wish it was a little longer, if anything! THIS GAME IS SO GOOD AMAZING 15/10 A short, lovely platformer-adventure. Beautiful environments, animations, and music complement an open level design full of shortcuts, secrets, and wildly creative bosses. Draws influence from Wonder Boy In Monster World, La Mulana, and good old Castlevania SoTN, with some quality-of-life touches courtesy of Dark Souls. Not a tough game on the first pass, but there\\'s a new game+ and Insane difficulty for players looking for a little more. \\n\\nLovingly crafted but never imposing, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a solid game on all fronts. Highly recommended for \"Metroidvania\" junkies, or for anyone looking for a comfy platformer to round out their library. Awesome game! A must-play for metroidvania fans.\\nI eagerly await the next Momodora. My friend showed me this game\\'s store page and I was instantly sold. Not knowing what I was getting into, I was pleasantly surprised with mechanics that remind me of the SoulsBorne franchise. Not like this is a bad thing, the mechanics compliment the game nicely. The game is difficult, but the combat is entertaining enough to keep me going. Exploration is rewarded with mostly health upgrades. Unfortunately, there\\'s only 2 upgrades for your bow, and just a meager 1 upgrade for character abilities: to dodge mid-air. That\\'s it. Nonetheless, the game was entertaining and worth the money. Cavestory meets Castlevania, with a nice, dark, bloodborne esq undertone.\\nMomodora: Get Rekt and keep playing!\\nvery easy control scheme, especially with a game pad and with interesting side missions, characters and content to be worth the light price tag :D Really, really good game, too bad it´s TOO SMALL.\\nThe story isn´t anything original, but it´s good enough to keep you wanting to proceed.\\nThe soundtrack is AMAZING.\\nThe art overall is really good, very polished. Your movements are fluid and fight, even tho simple, is really fun and challenging at times.\\nIt makes funny mentions to other games.\\n\\nIMO it´s a 2d castlevania/metroidvania fans must have.\\n If you enjoy 2D platformers, exploration, or even just challenging-yet-rewarding games. I would highly recommend Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. From the wonderfully crafted artwork to the dark, and formidable tale; it\\'s a journey well worth experiencing. Fantastic. This is the way metroidvania types should be made. Cute version of Dark Souls gameplay with subtle story.\\nChallenging enough but not to the point of tears and sweating blood.\\nVery pleasant alternative to a AAA title you\\'re currently playing and want to take a break form for something different. Tight combat, fun platforming, and light exploration that will put up a good challenge and leave you wanting more.  As of the time of this review Momodora RutM is my personal game of the year and I can\\'t recommend it enough to people itching for a good action adventure game.\\n\\nFennel spinoff game when? I normally hate metroidvania-style games due to their controls, and I always feel like combat is too hard and complicated to be any fun.\\n\\nThis is not the case for Momodora.\\n\\nSure, the controls could be better (I prefer to have the mouse included in my mouse and keyboard setup), but everything else makes up for it. The art and ambience is beautiful. The mechanics are quick to learn. The difficulty curve is eased in quickly but slowly enough that even a novice (such as myself) can figure things out before I get thrown into the hard stuff.\\n\\nI\\'ve only played this for half an hour so far, but even with just 30 minutes of play, I\\'d suggest this game to anyone, fan of the genre or not.\\n\\nEDIT: After completing this game (multiple times), I can say that this game is still worth it. When it\\'s on sale (like it is at the time of this edit), there is absolutely no reason not to buy it. The cancer I got from watching too many cringe complimations, was cured by this game.\\n\\n420/42 A smooth and great platformer. It gives off dark souls vibe in how hard it is. The fighting system is great and I like how the game stops for a millisecond whenever you hit an enemy, Overall its a really good game if you wanted to get your platformer/Metroidvenia dose.\\n\\nIt gave out what it set out to do if that makes sense lol. Amazing game.  Bit short but other wise 10/10. The story\\'s simple. A preistess whoes trying to save her land from a curse. \\n\\nThe game looks really good. \\n\\nThe platforming is simple. Not that many endlless pits and instant death spikes. \\n\\nThe combat is easy. You can either slap enemies with your magical leaf or use your trusty bow and arrow, and you can dodge roll attacks. \\n\\nMusic fits the area to me. \\n    \\nIt\\'s a short game. You can beat it in about 3 hours if you\\'re playing on the easy difficulty. 4 or 5 if you\\'re trying to complete the map and on normal. Maybe a bit more if you\\'re trying to get EVERY item and trying to beat it on the harder difficulties. \\n\\nI think this is a good game and also a good intro to metroidvania games for people who didn\\'t really play those types of games. OS: Windows 10\\nPlayed with: Gamepad\\nPlaytime:  5-6 hours\\n\\nSolid platformer with excellent visuals (character design, backgrounds, animations). Challenging enough I often found myself dead outside the boss fights. Well worth the full asking price and a great deal if you find it on sale. Not much backstory beyond the occasional reference to how the Queen\\'s curse spread to the protagonist\\'s village. Character development is nonexistent but on the plus side you get to beat up enemies with a Maple leaf, sometimes while transformed as a cat.\\n\\nMomodora 1 and 2 appear to be freely available (unless you are feeling charitable) from the developers personal webpage: https://rdein.itch.io/\\n\\nMomodora 3 is available on Steam as well. Haven\\'t played it yet, but planning on picking it up to see if it adds anything to the overall story. This is game is a perfect improvement on Momodora III. It\\'s one of my favorite indie games of all time. The other games were mostly a way to cope with the lack of Cave Story content left to be experienced, by playing a Cave Story-esque game, but Momodora:RUtM is its own game that really developed its own feel, away from Cave Story and other indie games. It\\'s definitely worth the money. With multiple endings and plenty of secret collectibles, this game is far more than a linear adventure game. It\\'s pretty much as open world as a platformer can get. I\\'d give this game a 9.5/10 This is one of the rare games that actually does get better after the beginning.\\n\\nTry not to judge the game on the first couple of hours. Once you get past the dodgy hitboxes, uncomfortably stiff controls, enemies that only telegraph some of their attacks, a dodge roll that leaves you vulnerable to contact damage with enemies, bullshit ambushes, two-to-three hit deaths, the lack of healing in the first two areas, envirnomental hazards that sometimes kill you and sometimes do nothing because you have to go through them, enemies who can surprise-lunge at you or hide their projectiles in the foreground objects, enemies that spam projectiles at you from offscreen, early bosses that rely on rote-memorization because they have more attacks that kill you out of nowhere than you have hit points...\\n\\nWell, once you get past that nonsense, it seems to be a fairly nice game. For some reason, the first two areas are significantly harder than the third and fourth. I nearly quit and tried to get a refund, but kept at it due to the reviews. The powerup that increases your max HP gives you an insultingly small amount, but unlocking healing items doubles your available HP. I\\'m not sure why the developer put all of that behind a wall of bullshit.\\n\\nPaid $10, fairly happy with it so far. rdein, stop killing everyone pls Smacked some crazy witch lady\\'s titties, 10/10 game of the year. Movement +\\nCombat +\\nDifficulty +\\nExploration +\\nAudio +\\nVisuals +\\nLength \\'alright\\'\\n\\nAm I a total sucker for metroidvania games? Yes\\n\\nThe story left a lot to be desired, [spoiler] especially with the bad ending I ended with (Assuming there\\'s multiple endings). [/spoiler] Kinda just left me saying \"ok.\" at the very end but I don\\'t really look to story when playing a video game anyway.\\nEverything was great and executed really well with no real flaw IMO\\nOnly thing I experienced was the difficulty scaling. I died way more times to \\'Pardoner Fennel\\' (second boss) than to the final boss. Though that could be me getting used to the controls and combat. (All those health upgrades probably helped a ton as well :P)\\n\\nWould totally recommend this game. 9/10 Short game but at the same time very enjoyable, if you have the cash to spend on a game then i suggest you buy this one This game is a great metroidvania with beatiful colors, sprites and music. While short, I felt like nothing was rushed and everything was fleshed out. Very difficult (on hard at least), but fun. Super Great! excellent sprite animation and pixel artwork. only about 6 hours long but so fun i immeadiatly started playing again to get all the Acheivements. So all in all i\\'d say an 8 hour game. You can see how truly great this game is when all the (very few) negative reviews are about whiny people that don\\'t like platforming ~ exploration and / or difficult stuff. It\\'s ok to dislike those things, but if you do, why bother playing - and most important, reviewing - a game that\\'s all about this?\\n\\nWell, that aside, let\\'s talk about the product. Momodora is one of the greatest surprises I\\'ve ever had, first because of its price compared to the content you get (not anything too broad, but enough to keep you tuned for about 4~6 hours) and because of the quality of said content. The game is very pretty, visually and aurally combined, and you can feel the passion the devs put into their work at every single room of the map. The controls are simple but effective, and besides one or two design quirks that personally I would\\'ve changed (the interaction between the attack and roll animations, and the invincibility frames of the latter) there\\'s nothing to complain about - you have melee and ranged attacks, dodge, double-jump and items with various active and passive effects to use. The level design makes good use of that variation, and from time to time you\\'ll find yourself using everything at your disposal to keep progressing between all the nine areas from the map, each one with its own theme and boss. The difficulty level can be quite challenging too, but in a fair way, encouraging players to adapt to their enemies\\' pattern and play it safe until they can predict and master the outcomes. This is more evident during boss fights, where bosses that appears to be a menacing threat at first can be killed without damaging the player after understanding how and when they\\'ll attack.\\n\\nAll in all Momodora is an incredible game, a very inexpensive experience that will entertain and please you without overstaying its welcome (the game knows how to end without wearing its novel value) but giving enought reasons (collectible items, new difficulties, achievements) to be played again if you wish to. For fans of the Metroidvania genre (the non-linear and exploration heavy 2D formula popularized by, you guessed it, Metroid and Castlevania) this game will be more than enough to enter that sweet spot of great recent representatives, alongside Salt and Sanctuary, Ori and The Blind Forest, and Axiom Verge. All the praise Momodora receives is well deserved, and if you like anything about the genre, give it a try. You will not be disappointed. Really good if you like metroidvania games with a bit of a challenge. \\nGreat sprite design.\\nGood replay value. \\n\\n10/10 Yes. I\\'ll be writing a more detailed Review when i got all the achievements. Fun metroidvania with very nice sprite art and some good platforming.  The bosses are the highlight, as they are very challenging, but fair.  \\n\\nRoughly 100% playthrough on hard difficulty took me six hours.  There\\'s new game+ available as well as bonuses if you can beat bosses without getting hit (good luck). I was expecting Anime Castlevania.\\n\\nWhat I got was [h1][b]YOU DIED[/b][/h1] Some gal in a white dress pulled a blood-red sword on me and danced all over my ass to some sexy piano music.  Then she did it again and again.  After I won I put that soundtrack on loop for several hours and suddenly the game got easier.  10/10. This is a great MetroidVania with some interesting combat and a compelling in game universe. Loved it. fight a giant boob witch, 10/10 95% completion in 4 hours. Game controls are kind of annoying - full animations must finish before next animation can begin. So you can\\'t quickly dodge even though you can see the attack coming. Healing and other items have a timer that seems very slightly unreasonable. \\nOverall 4/10. Buy on sale or don\\'t bother. This game is SO GOOD! [strike]Joined my all-nighter game squad[/strike]\\nTotally worth buying at full price. Anyone who loves platformers and/or metroidvania games will love this. Amazing art, backgrounds, story and music!\\n[spoiler]And cute cats[/spoiler] This is such a beautiful game. I absolutely adore it! The developers clearly have a love for this game which shows in every aspect. \\n[list]\\n[*]The sound track is simply moving. So well composed. I connect with it on an emotional level and can feel the urgency and despiration of the in game situation in my core. If you are a fan of the music the OST DLC is absolutely worth the money. \\n\\n[*]It is visually appealing. Even if you aren\\'t a fan of the pixel look there is apprecation to be had for how each area is presented. The spritework is fantastic and the level design is so rich.\\n\\n[*]Very user friendly gameplay. Combat is solid. It can be challenging at times, but never frustratingly so (I played on easy.) I never once wanted to quit playing because an area was difficult, rather I looked forward to overcoming it.\\n\\n[*]The story is simple, but in a good way. It is easy to follow and become attached to. \\n[/list]\\nAlthough the game is short (Halfcordinated\\'s speed run of the game at SGDQ2016 was about a half hour,) it is fulfilling. You can take it at your own pace or get down to business. Definitely buy this game if you are even remotely interested. It exceeds it\\'s worth! -Good soundtrack (buy it with the game, seriously, it\\'s just good, go support the devs)\\n-Awesome gameplay & mechanics \\n-Best 2D souls game i\\'ve ever played\\n-Cute\\n-Interesting story and plot\\n\\nMade this man shed a tear\\n\\n10/10\\n\\nI hope another momodora game devs, i am so satisfied, good job! Fantastic game, one of the best Metroidvanias out there right now. This is the closest you\\'ll get to Castlevania: SoTN on the PC. Wish it was a bit longer but I love it. Solid metroid style game! This game feels great! It feels like a mixture of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Dark Souls. It\\'s my understanding that there\\'s more than just getting to the ending, so I\\'m very excited to continue playing and explore the world.\\n\\nI did a playthrough on normal, with my last Metroidvania experience being Symphony of the Night when I was a kid, and it took me about 7 hours. I was able to reach the final boss without any guides, but looked up extra information after killing the boss to help direct me to smaller bits of content I didn\\'t notice. I don\\'t usually write reviews, but I loved this so much that I have to make an exception.\\n\\nThis is the best Metroidvania I\\'ve played in recent years. \\nAs someone who grew up with Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night and regards Cave Story as one of the best Games ever made, I\\'ve waited years for something like this to come around.\\n\\nIt looks beautiful, its world, exploration, pacing and gameplay are great, and while it\\'s a little bit on the short side, it\\'s filled to the brim with content. It\\'s all killer, no filler.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and support the developer by buying this game, and its great predecessor, right now, if you\\'re anything like me, you won\\'t regret it. Praise the Momo! I\\'ve been trying hard to find games to fill my metrovania hole. This game came close, it was too short ultimately. Fun though. It\\'s challenging even on normal, not salt and sanctuary challenging but challenging. I would have liked to to be longer and with more upgrades but you only get 4 or 5 notable upgrades and one (the upgrade to maple leaf) can be easily missed even though wheter or not you have it effects the ending you get! This game won\\'t get the recognition it deserves. Truly a pleasure to play. Tight controls and verb set, haunting environments with highly detailed and layered pixel art, enchanting tunes to fit the mood, and sizable map with secrets to find.\\n\\nLittle bit Metroidvania, little bit Souls, little bit Cave Story, and an all around blast to play. My only wish is that there was more; but hey, for the price and the fact that it was made with such a small team, it\\'s definitely a fantastic game. \\n\\nAnd, I definitely recommend playing through previous entries in the series. While not as polished, they\\'re still impressive games with an emphasis on responsive combat. I\\'m personally a fan of the pixel-art visual style already, so when implemented with small touches such as the grass moving as you pass, it\\'s a real treat to look at. Gameplay is geared toward exploration: branching paths, secret rooms, etc. The majority of the time anything felt difficult, it was something I was doing wrong as a player (such as not being patient enough) rather than poor design.\\nOverall a quick atmospheric quest with lots of replay value. Wonderful combo of metroidvania and believe it or not a few SOULS series.This game is worth every cent.The only down side is the lenght(short).Not as good as Salt and Sanctuary but still a very good one.\\nYou could call this game \"kawaii souls\" An interesting metroidvania platformer that has a bit of a dark souls vibe going for it. Mechanically the game is solid and the level and enemy design is interesting and varied. \\n\\nThe only real problems I had with the gameplay was the tendency of the games boss enemies to feel a bit to heavy centered around trial and error, as not understanding how the boss\\' attacks work can get you instantly killed. The game is quite short, and I feel that the side characters and the setting could have benefited from being fleshed out more. It\\'s an interesting world, and I would have liked to have seen and heard about more of it.\\n\\nAll in all I think it is a good game and worth playing, although you probably won\\'t get more than 5 or 6 hours out of it at most. Fantastic Game. Has all the elements that I love in a metroidvania game. Extremely good exploration, pacing, upgrades, and boss fights. This is one of those games that I keep coming back to the store out of just pure curosity if I want it or not. I eventually cracked, bought it; now currently enjoying it. It\\'s a bit short I\\'ve heard but other than that the overal game is gorgeous in its own right. Pixle art is amazing, the music matches with the scenery perfectly, characters are interesting enough to keep me playing, upgrades are entertaining and make me play more to see what I get later on. Overall, this game kinda gives me a bloodborne esque at one point, the broken decrepted backgrounds, the moody music to add with it; all in one complete game. I completely recommend this game, but sadly only for sale due to it being quite short I\\'ve heard. I give it a 8/10 A combatcentric metroidvania with heavy souls influences. Very restrained in its systems, quality over quantity. Very nice 2D platformer with beautiful spritework and music.\\nDefinitely worth a try!\\nMight be a bit hard, but it feels so good when you can get to the next savepoint.\\nGlad I stumbled upon this gem.\\nSimple but effective combat and plenty of items to collect and use. Solid game. Controls are tight and the combat has a nice weight to it. Very enjoyable 2D metrovania. I was able to find almost everything without a guide which is nice. \\n\\nI feel you can show off your skill in this. A bit like Dark Souls really.\\n\\nAnyway, I recommend. Excellent in every way.  Truely something I\\'ve been searching to play.  The game controls as smooth better than I could dream.  The gameplay mechanics work in tandum with everything.  It feels completely natural to play, well animated and drawn, and the collectables are rewarding.  With the perfect amount of difficulty to which if you mess up, you can only blame yourself, and a story that you discover as you play, it leaves me wanting more.  The game isn\\'t too long but is more than enough for what it brings to the table. Get to fight with a witch with big titites...say no moar 10/10 LOVE THIS GAME\\n\\nThe Good\\n-runs on toasters\\n-nice atmosphere\\n-very, \"play it your way\" style\\n-completionists dream\\n-music\\n-You get to play as a cat (and its adorable)\\n-difficult\\n-the psuedo-minimalistic art is simply fantastic\\n-can last up to 8-12 hours trying to get all the items and goodies\\n\\nThe Bad\\n-backtracking (comes with the territory of \"metroidvania\" [god I hate that term] games)\\n-can be a campy type of difficult due to enemy placement\\n-(personal nitpick) like hyperlight drifter its a bit grating(repetitive)/empty when it comes to boss music \\n\\nThe Ugly\\n-nothing.......nothing is ugly about this game\\n\\nI say buy it to complete it Not good Amazing visuals, tight gameplay, and a satisfying minimalistic plot.\\nIt is super polished. The controls are very responsive, the platforming is just right, and, while difficult, the game never feels unfair.\\nAlso, there\\'s definitely a Souls influence here (which is great!): dodge move, refillable consumables, and unintrusive story.\\n\\nAll in all, Momodora is a great, albeit short, game. Beat DS3.\\nTraded in DS3 for Steam card.\\nBought Momodora.\\nThe cycle is complete. A lot of people claim a game is \"The Dark Souls of *game genre*\" but I feel like this one really deserves that title. Challenging side scroll action if you want it to be, still a cute platformer on easier difficulties. Could kill several hours to finish and it\\'s not too painfully tedious to warrant another playthrough. A great wekend trip, not long to be boring and not to short to feel unsatisfied. \\nAs a positive review and a recomendation to buyi it and play, I\\'ll write down the negative stuff only.\\n\\n-Enemies deal way too damage from the very beginning.\\n-Can\\'t cut the combo animation to roll/dodge.\\n-The shaking camera in boss fights. (I undestand it with powerfull attacks but when you deal a normal one, makes things confusing plus the insane amount of damage the boss deal.)\\n-No 16:9 screen.\\n-The water dungeon entrance. \\n [b]Pros[/b]\\n+ Gameplay felt very slick and responsive. Using the bow was a lot of fun.\\n+ The atmosphere, soundtrack, and artwork are all top notch. \\n+ Solid level design and a nice variety of different settings. \\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n- It\\'s way too short (About 5-6 hours on hard)\\n- A lot of items you can buy feel underwhelming compared to others\\n\\nI gotta say a few times I felt like I was playing a 2D Bloodborne and I loved it. If you\\'re a fan of Metroidvanias and/or the Souls games I would highly recommend you check this game out. It\\'s a hella lot of fun and is challenging enough that it feels rewarding when you take down a section and/or boss. \\n\\nFinal Score - ★★★★☆ I had been looking for metroidvania kinda platformer for a long time , would stumble upon such game every now and then but never felt this satisfied until I played Momodora 4, this game is just perfect, for some one who is looking through the internet to find that one game to satisy your thirst for such style of game play and exploration ,then your search ends here. BUY THIS GAME NOW. Literally the only thing bad to say about this game is that I wished it was longer. This game is hands-down one of the best Metroidvania games I\\'ve played in recent years. The feel of the game, the story delivered subtly through the environment and a few lines of dialogue, it\\'s all so wonderfully beautifully crafted. The controls are sharp; I never once felt like something was hard because the controls sucked (something you can\\'t say about a lot of games). Normal mode was plenty difficult for me, but there\\'s an easy mode for those that find the game too hard, and a hard mode for those that want a more punishing Dark Souls feel. Absolutely fantastic \"metroidvania\" game. With the sole exception of a single bit of obtuse backtracking needed for progression, I loved every moment of it.\\n\\nI only wish there were more.\\n\\nOh, not to mention secrets, additional difficulties, and NG+ (for when you want to go back and destroy the bosses you struggled with to start with.) Excellent, excellent Metroidvania. The platforming and combat is fluid and rewarding. The entire game clearly had a lot of love for the genre put into it, as nearly everything about it is fantastic. If you like Metriodvanias at all, this game is a must. This game is rad. Literally 2D Dark Souls. Get it immediately. I\\'m only writing this review because this game showed up in the Metroidvania bundle and most reviews claim it as Metroidvania-esque. On that I would humbly disagree. This game is more like a 2D Souls game minus the RPG elements. If that interests you, then you should look into it.\\n\\nMy criticisms:\\n\\nIf you compare this game to the two greats in the genre, Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night, it is quite clear it is not Metroidvania. Some aspects it shares, notably the map style and mechanically interesting boss fights/arenas. But it fails in what I think are some big important aspects of the genre and that is abilities, items/secrets, and map traversal/exploration.\\n\\nMomodora essentially offers little in the way of true exploration. You don\\'t get a space jump, or a bat form, or a mist form. You only really gain one ability to allow you traverse new areas and it is very apparent where and what they are and it is more of a way of metering your way through the game. Super Metroid and SOTN offer a plethora of skills or weapons that dramatically alter how you will approach or revisit a level. Momodora does little with that. \\n\\nItems come in the form of equippable trinkets that are either active or passive. These offer small benefits like a heal, more money, or a vacuum for instance. None of these really help you explore the world like say Missiles, Super Missles, Bombs, Gravity suit. None of them also alter the way you play the game like different weapon types ala Alucard.\\n\\nThere really is nothing to explore too. Sure, there are some hidden things, but they are truly unimaginatively hidden due to the previous two issues. There are no interesting abilities that allow you to explore new areas, so no hidden corners containing new Missile Expansions or Silver/Gold Glasses. Additionally there aren\\'t that many items that can\\'t just be purchased, so there are no avenues containing something interesting/equippable like Alucard\\'s weapons or armors or cards. \\n\\nIt takes away the aspects of Metroidvania that I really enjoy, notably progression through interesting itemization and exploration. What is left is a competent 2D platformer with a heavy emphasis on action combat. Its good at that. Its just not a good Metroidvania. Roll your way to victory! Do you wish Bloodborne had more cute girls in it, and was really cheap? Pick this up and play it on Hard mode.\\n\\nDo you with Metroid had more melee combat and items, and cute girls in it? Play it on normal.\\n\\nSeriously, this game is good. Great graphics, amazing atmostphere, nice bosses. 10/10. 10/10\\nOne of the best \"Metroidvania\" games ever made.\\nWorth buying, worth playing, and definitely worth supporting. Im gonna be honest here, I really liked the art style from the screenshots so I decided to buy, but I am having no fun. I expected a MegaMan X/Shovel knight speed and platforming, but the game is much slower and more calculated. I cant call this a bad game, but I found it slow and dull. (The art style is still apealing however) Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight= Dark souls + Terraria\\n\\n10/10 its just too hard Fun and solid Metroidvania, bit short so don\\'t pay more than $10 for it.  One issue is that FPS is bit wonky at times and game isn\\'t very well optmizied. I haven\\'t even finished this game yet and all I can say is that if this game looks interesting to you at all, pick it up you won\\'t be disappointed. I\\'m going to play the ever-living f*ck of out this game and I can already tell only having played half an hour.\\nWhat an incredible piece. I\\'ll be waiting after summer sale to buy all the people I can copies of it to support the developer.\\n\\nBuy it.\\nJust do it. very good, meroid+dark souls [h1][i] Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an action-packed metroid-vania platformer which manages to deliver almost perfectly in both atmosphere and gameplay.[/i][/h1]\\n\\nOverall, the game is pretty damn good. M: RUtM stays loyal to ye olde platformers that many of us have come to love, and even I, who has never played any of the Metroid, LoZ or Castlevania series\\' games, came to love this game. Note to self: gotta play those old-school platformers when I can!\\n\\n[h1]The good [/h1]\\n+ Tight, responsive controls\\n+ Great soundtrack\\n+ Fair yet challenging platforming\\n+ Beautiful pixel art and design: backgrounds, character sprites, enemies, look great.\\n+ Actually interesting and original characters.\\n+ Good enemy variety.\\n+ Fun boss fights\\n+ The animations all have this [b]*Wham*[/b] to it, you know what I mean?\\n+ Lots of secrets and easter eggs to find -- I searched everywhere but probably missed a dozen!\\n+ The story keeps progressing at a steady pace...\\n\\n[h1]The average [/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*] ...but the game itself may be a little too short (for those who don\\'t have a knack for secret-hunting and backtracking: my first playthrough was about 8h while searching every nook and cranny)\\n[*] Sometimes the bosses are very easy, other times they may be very difficult. \\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]The bad [/h1]\\n- If you backtrack, enemies don\\'t aggro to you and ambushes become pretty much obsolete (but let\\'s be honest, I really found nothing [i]actually[/i] bad about this game.)\\n\\n[h1]Critique and opinions [/h1]\\n[b]Now, this part onwards may have spoilers.[/b] If you\\'ve read the review without playing the game, simply skip this part.\\n\\nThere were some things I wished would have been done a little bit better. The game is amazing, don\\'t get me wrong, but some things could\\'ve been different, at least in my honest opinion. You could use your Bow and Arrow to simply cheese most of your enemies, even some bosses. I hope the devs will design their future releases trying to counter ranged weapon spamming.\\n\\nThe sudden difficulty gaps may be subjective, but I think it would\\'ve been nice if some bosses would\\'ve changed places with each others. Actually, every boss felt like a cakewalk after [spoiler] Pardoner Fennel[/spoiler]. \\n\\nTalking more about bosses, they could have used a bit more attacks. They usually have only 3~5 different attacks, and some of those even are ridiculously easy to dodge, even by standing still ([spoiler] example: Final boss\\' final form\\'s 2/3 attacks were straight aimed at the player, 1/3 was easily dodged by standing beneath it[/spoiler]). If a new Momodora game comes out, I\\'d definitely like to see more attacks, and maybe phase 2\\'s during bosses.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The conclusion [/h1]\\n\\nAll in all, this game is amazing. If you\\'re still wondering whether you should buy it, go ahead. It\\'s worth even the full price. It definitely has no real flaws and it\\'s a joy to play from beginning to end. The developers can -- and I hope they will -- improve and bring us even better games in the future.\\n\\nI can\\'t wait to play Momodora 5 when it comes out!! one of the best games based on the revolutionary war, red coat scum. Think if castlevannia and dark souls had a baby\\n\\n\\ngreat game, little on the short side but challenging boss fights. This game absolutely blew my expectations away and then some! Movement feels perfect, the artwork is beautiful, bosses are challenging but fair, cool side characters, sweet upgrades, definitely perfect. Buy this game and you won\\'t regret it [b] TL;DR 4/5. Short but great game. Really well done pixel graphics. Fun gameplay mechanics. A great mix of the metroidvania and Souls-like genre. [/b]\\n\\nThe fourth of the Momodora series, RUtM comes back with a revamped art style and gameplay, creating a great game that is satisfying to play and really put yourself into, where you find yourself saying things like \"I should have just dodged there.\", \"Why did I go for that attack?\" or other things that\\'d be considered vulgar language. \\n\\nThe music and art style is stunning and helps with the immersion in the game. Even if you are dashing through the zones, your character, the enemies and NPCs, all feel like they belong in that atmospheric background behind them.\\n\\nSeasoned metroidvania or avid Soulborn games fan, one can find something they\\'ll like in Momodora: RUtM. And the only downside for such a good game is that you can\\'t get enough of it. It is short (about 4-5 hours to finish), but its lengthy enough to feel dynamic when you play through it, making you wonder what abilities you will unlock, or what new items you will find whenever you step into a new area. So I recommend to give Momodora: RUtM a try atleast it is definitely a gem that seems to be overlooked and should be one game that everyone should atleast try and check out. As someone who is a huge fan of the platformer genre, as well as metroidvania games, I love this game. In my opinion, the art style is great, the gameplay is very fluid, and overall the game thus far has been very enjoyable. I myself think I\\'m having as much fun with it as I did first playing Shovel Knight, which by far has been one of the best games I\\'ve played in quite a while. \\n\\nPros - \\n[list]\\n[*]Great gameplay.\\n[*]Beautiful art style.\\n[*]Enjoyable and challenging boss fights.\\n[*]Appeals to the less hardcore players as well as the people who enjoy a challenge.\\n[*][spoiler]You can transform into a cat. Yay?[/spoiler] \\n[/list]\\n\\nCons -\\n[list]\\n[*]Awfully short game.\\n[*]Some content is very difficult to achieve.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\nI think Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an amazing game, and I have no regrets on purchasing it. If you like metroidvania games, or maybe even Souls-like games, this would be a wonderful game for you to pick up.\\n 10/10 The closest game you\\'ll get to BloodBorne on PC.\\nFor now at least. It\\'s not the longest platformer I\\'ve played, but I LOVED the easy to pick up combat, and the art style and ambiance of the map. 5/7 perfect score. Absolutely love this game\\nBeautiful soundtrack and artstyle really blend together and give an amazing atmosphere. With on point combat mehanics and a variety of routes and methods around the map i could play this many times taking differant approaches every time. \\n\\nThe enemy design and mechanics are great while also being absolutely rock hard. this game will fuck you if you miss time a dodge or hit and has a real darksouls vibe with its save mechamics mixed with its brutal difficulty. This especially goes for the bosses who are amazing desigened and each bring a differant startegy for taking them out that dont revolve around just spamming the same attack. \\n\\nThe theme and tone of the game is also extremely dark and many charecter interactions and rooms have a creepy aura that surrounds them which adds alot to the atmosphere of the game without having to completly spell it out to the player. \\nEasily entered as one of the best games ive played this year and probably onto one of my favorite games ever.\\n\\nJust buy it now This game is astonishingly beautiful. The spriting is very nice, the story is breathtaking, and the music is absolutely fantastic. A must have. The only problem I had with it was the keyboard controls, but if you use a controller you\\'ll be fine.\\n Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a charming mix of Iga-vania games with a splash of Dark Souls. \\n\\nMovement and combat are relatively fast paced and straightforward, which I appreciated. Variety comes in the form of active use items and passive items, which let you change the properties of your attacks, increased the amount of money you find, or trade health for a temporary damage boost.\\n\\nThe game is fairly brief compared to its influences, but that, too, was a welcome decision for me; as I have less time to play games these days, Momodora: RUtM was a game I could find the time to complete. Although it\\'s not a terrible game, part of the reason I wouldn\\'t recommend this game is based on its overwhelmingly positive reviews. I just don\\'t think it\\'s that good, and I think its score should reflect that.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the good. The game is beautiful. The character animations are wonderful, and the designs are great. It\\'s a Metroidvania game, and any Metroidvania is better than no Metroidvania.\\n\\nSadly, everything else kinda peeves me. The controls aren\\'t bad, but I always seem to be running into enemies. The double-jump\\'s second jump is painfully short. The active frames for the attacks in the 3-hit combo are very short, and enemies often sneak in between attacks and hit you. The range of the melee attack is a bit dire, and the 3-hit combo makes the main character move forward, which can make her fall into pits or walk into enemies between hits. I can\\'t seem to get the timing for the 3-hit combo right without mashing the attack button.\\n\\nMost of the areas are dark, which makes enemies and traps hard to see, which feels cheap. Enemy damage is kinda nuts, for most of the game 2 hits is enough to kill your character, which makes the tiny health upgrades seem useless. Walking into enemies doesn\\'t hurt, but jumping on them does. Enemies spam projectiles from way off-screen, which is super lame. Boss fights are practically impossible using melee attacks, but easy (but painfully long) with ranged attacks. The game is pretty short, at about 4 hours for a playthrough.\\n\\nI always feel bad slagging a game like Momodora, because the devs\\' hearts are in the right place. I feel like a few small adjustments could have made the game much less frustrating. If you are looking for a good Metroidvania, I would go for Guacamelee before buying this game. Darksouls platformer.\\nEpic boss fights.\\nSimple fun and rewarding combat.\\nGreat soundtrack. great game with beautiful pixel art, nice music and, god, you can turn into a cute cat, what else do you want. cute pixel dark souls yeah.     I really enjoyed this game! The combat was addictive and I beat it in roughly 6-7 hours of playing it straight. Things got extra fun when I got to explore multiple paths.\\n\\nPros: Tight controls | Addicting combat | Loads to discover | Well balanced difficulty\\n\\n    Sadly there\\'s some major game design flaws that\\'d be so easy to patch up. They almost kept me from playing the game. What the hell were they thinking making the entire screen flash red when you take damage? My eyes were killing me dear god! It\\'s more noticable during the first area considering 80% OF THE COLORS ARE COMPRISEd OF GREEN.\\n    Alongside maximum eyestrain, the first area contains an enemy used to teach you how to roll. You have to roll past em to attack their backs, BUT THEY TURN TO FACE YOU |IMMEDIATELY| unless they\\'re about to attack (NO WARNING, NO WIND UP), or just finished attacking! This gave the first stage an ungodly level of difficulty simply due to bad game design. (I\\'d start listing off more stuff\\n    The characters lack full believability considering they use the same dialect and all have the same opinion. The delivery of the story is stale and it gives you questions it never answers.\\n\\nCons: Eyestrain | Simple game design flaws | Stale characters/Story\\n\\n     Conclusion: Overall the cons are ignorable; it\\'s the gameplay that really matters. The game is fun and addictive :D and I might even re-beat it on newgame+ or hardmode! There\\'s plenty of replayability with the achievements and extra items to obtain. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a fantastic game with gorgeous pixel artwork and environments, a non-linear world to explore, and an amazing soundtrack to go with it. The combat is smooth and satisfying, and you can find a wide variety of items to enhance Kaho\\'s attacks or gain new ones. The atmosphere of this game\\'s world is one I deeply enjoyed - the characters, enemies, and bosses you encounter throughout the game all reveal interesting bits about what\\'s going on, and the contrast between different areas really makes you feel like you\\'re exploring a varied world. As for difficulty, being able to choose is nice - the game is much more challenging on higher difficulties due to low starting HP, but I never found it unfair or artificially difficult. It made me learn from my mistakes, and by the end of the game I was far more confident when tackling a tough enemy or boss. I definitely recommend this game to Metroidvania fans, but also to people just looking into it - the easier difficulties still allow you to enjoy the game, and can even help people try out this sort of game genre.\\nAlso, one last thing - I highly recommend buying the soundtrack bundle. The game\\'s music overall is really good, but the boss themes are exceptional and I\\'ve been listening to some of them over and over because they\\'re so good! seriously great game, my only complant was that it seemed kinda short An absolute joy to play. I enjoyed II and III (I was basically a Cave Story fangame, how far the developer has come) but this trumps all that have come before.\\n\\n Momodora: RutM is a slightly short but tight, challenging Metroidvania.  Don\\'t let the cute, well-animated graphics fool you; this is a difficult game, and the setting and story are saturated with an atmosphere of melancholic despair.  You\\'ll die a lot, but the game is never unfair; it\\'a always because you didn\\'t play well enough.  When you do reach the end, victory isn\\'t quite everything you had hoped for.  I\\'ve seen a lot of people compare this to Dark Souls, and while I hate the \"every difficult game is just like Dark Souls!\" comparisons you always see thrown around nowadays, this game really does have a similar atmosphere.\\n\\nThe important thing about a Metroidvania, however, is the gameplay, and Momodora is spot-on.  The controls are tight, combat is satisfying, and there are secrets hidden everywhere.  There are a lot of branching paths a a wide variety of different types of areas and enemies.  The boss fights are great; they\\'re all unique and fun, although the later ones are perhaps a bit less challenging than the earlier ones.  I could complain that the game is a little short; I finished 100% exploration on normal mode in about six hours, and I\\'m sure I could do it much faster on a second playthrough now that I know where everything is and I know all of the boss patterns.  That\\'s a reasonable length for the price, though, and every one of those hours is a great experience.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint about the game compared to other games in its genre is the lack of upgrades.  One of the key components of any Metroidvania is the gradual unlocking of new powers that increase your offensive capabilities and mobility.  Over the course of the game you\\'ll acquire a number of \"active\" items that you can equip and use to do things like heal yourself or increase your attack power, and you\\'ll acquire more \"passive\" items that add effects such as poison to your ranged attacks.  You can only have a small number of items equipped at once, though, which means you\\'ll probably find a couple you like and then never use any of the others.  Outside of equippable items, you\\'ll only find five permanent new abilities; two of them are upgrades to your ranged weapon\\'s charge attack, one of which just makes your melee weapon do more damage, and only two of which actually provide new mobility options.  At the end of the game, I didn\\'t really feel like I had many more options that I did at the beginning.\\n\\nStill, that\\'s not really a big problem, so don\\'t let it discourage you.  If this game sounds at all interesting to you, it\\'ll be worth your time. Great game, fun exploration, amazing bossfights, best played on hard. I get to kill a giant witch by slapping her boobs.\\n-10/10\\n\\nBut really, this game is amazing with absolutely solid gameplay and dark souls tier difficulty. Super fun game. I honestly don\\'t know what to say other than it\\'s fucking good A pixelated sidescrolling hack-n-slash? P-pleasegiveittome! This is a really great classic metroidvania style game. I don\\'t really have much unique to say about it but it was really good so I\\'m recommending it. \\nFun and solid comat.\\nNice underlying story, but it in the sorta Darksouls method of telling and that is fuckin figure it out yourself method, which it does well.\\nCute Charaters.\\nA difficulty for everyone, easy for people who just want to check it out, normal of look for some challenge, but not frustrating, hard for people looking for a tough challenge, and if hard wasn\\'t enough you have insane to make you go insane. Overall this is a fun and satifying game. Can be difficult, but once you get a good grasp of the dodging its not as bad. The main things I disliked were instakill spikes. Two particular spots irritated me. 1. A section where the checkpoint was just a bit\\ntoo far away. 2. In a boss arena. But other than those situation I greatly enjoyed this game and say that it is worth the money. Okay this is it this is the game that makes me write a review\\n\\nDid you like the GBA/DS Castlevania games?\\n\\nBuy this.\\n\\nYou didn\\'t play them?\\n\\nLook into this and then buy it.\\n\\nYou didn\\'t like them?\\n\\nReconsider, please, for this. Have to smash a giant girls oversized boobies with a maple leaf to kill her\\n\\n5318008/10 Among the best metroidvania on steam\\n\\nBeautiful music to go along\\n\\nTight combat\\n\\nAmazing pixel art animations Start the game.\\nSee that there are almost no options and specially controller/rebind options.\\nStart playing.\\nRealize controls/gameplay are really bad and unresponsive.\\nRoll through an enemy a bit too far so I end up touching him a bit.\\nRealize that touching enemies cause damage (almost half HP) in a game where you have a short range melee attack.\\nUninstall.\\n\\nI would give this game, with all its flaws, a pass some years ago, but nowadays, specially after playing much better games like salt and sanctuary... no way. I dont have many hours in the game but i have to say, it is perfect.\\nit reminds me of dark souls a lot and i love that game. has a lot cool enemies, fun boss fights, rage quits and the soundtrack is amazing, all of that in a single 2D pixel art game. i can\\'t congratulate the creator more for this game, i wish them the best of luck on their future games but i\\'m sure if they are 1% as cool as this one they are in a road of success.\\n 10/10 i recommend and i recommend again. This is a rather solid metroidvania given the price. It controls smooth and is rather fun to play. This game is rather short (it can be defeated in around two hours), though there are a fair number of secrets to discover. You are actively rewarded for skillful gameplay (bosses drop an special items if you defeat them without taking damage).\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s a well presented title that is worth a look if you are into this sort of game. I bought this game because \"Indie\"... I thought, I\\'ll give it a try, got to Pardoner.\\nEpic OST starts playing, palms sweaty, arms heavy, mom\\'s spaghetti... \\nIt\\'s on, until the point I started to regret it. It was exactly same emotion I felt after I killed Queelag in Dark Souls.\\n\\nSome of the bosses are dissapointing, but overall it\\'s a great game.\\nThis game has it, I don\\'t know how it\\'s called or what it even is... You\\'ll understand what I\\'m talking about when you\\'ll play it.\\n\\n Pixel Dark souls 10/10 A really solid game all around. Well animated, good platforming, simple-yet-varied combat, interesting boss fights, and some great music. A bit on the short side, but there\\'s some decent replayability for the completionists. [b]TL;DR: WORTH EVERY PENNY. A MASSIVELY fun game that you will find yourself racking up lots of hours playing if you\\'re a Darksouls/Metroidvania kind of fan or even if you just like platforming and combat.[/b]\\n\\nMomodora is a game about Kaho, a priestess from the village of Lum who sets out on a journey to rid her hometown of a curse by finding the source and purifying it. Armed with only a Holy Maple Leaf and a Magic Bow she must take down monsters of all kinds ready to kill her without mercy.\\n\\nPROS:\\nA Vibrant Bright World with Beautiful Graphics\\nA Nice Multi-Sectioned Map With Each Area Having their own Aesthetic\\nAn OST with Stupendous Tracks to Immerse you in the World and Fitting for Every Situation\\nA Simple yet Intriguing Story that Makes you want to find out Every Secret About It\\nEach Character and Enemy Have their Own Personality and Substance to them Despite any Lack of Text or Explanation\\nQuick Paced Combat Against Every Enemy and Challenging Combat Against All Bosses\\nA Plethora of Collectables that are Cleverly Hidden\\nAn Arsenal of Items to Choose from to Suit your Combat and/or Playstyle\\nEvery Single Accomplishment Feels Super Gratifying\\nA Lot of Replayability Value Despite its Debatably Short Length\\n\\nCONS:\\nToo Short (DEBATEABLE: READ THE CONCLUSION)\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nThis game will keep you entertained for hours. It drops you off and doesn\\'t hold your hand at all, it only tells you how to play and that\\'s it, you\\'re on your own from there. The challenge this game has is wonderful and suits any and all players. The multiple difficulty settings fit even the most casual players and the most hardcore players who get a kick out of the challenge. Insane mode is literally everything is a one hit kill <3 This game is worth every penny to buy and you won\\'t regret buying it one bit. You don\\'t even need a good computer to play this, it runs beautifully and looks beautiful with what they worked with and the art style. A perfectly polished game. The only downside I listed was that the game was too short. From my perspective the game was too short BUT on my first playthrough I had over 8 hours and loved every moment, and after that since there is so much replay value the game can last a long time without getting stale. What I mean by short in this situation is that the world is small, despite this though, getting 100% map completion and finding every collectible takes a lot of time if you don\\'t know where they are. This game is perfect in every aspect and I hope they make their future games just like this one but yet somehow happen to blow my mind even more with new creativity. Any price for this game less than the listed $9.99 (which is already astoundingly low) is a STEAL. BUY IT, and if you want to go the extra mile, support the devs by buying the OST which is beautiful all on its own.\\n\\nAmazing Game 10/10\\n\\n-Kayo Great little Metriodvania with a bit of Dark Souls mixed in for good measure. A solid Metroidvania which takes obvious inspiration from Cave Story. Beautiful art, fluid animations, a beautiful soundtrack, and solid gameplay. It\\'s pretty short (I finished my first run in a little under 5 hours), but it\\'s absolutely worth playing. All the charm and gameplay of Cave Story and Bloodborne\\'s aesthetic in a perfect package.\\n\\nThere is something visceral about a game that you simply cannot put down. Try as you might, your mind always goes back to it when you\\'re not playing it. On the surface, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight appears to be a standard Metroidvania. To those not aware of what a Metroidvania is, they tend to be combat-based platformers centered around exploring a large map and the various environments within - secrets are the norm and exploration is rewarded. Momodora collects these pieces and condenses these elements into the most fun I\\'ve had with a Metroidvania in recent years.\\n\\nThe story is short and to the point, leaving the player to fill in the gaps as to what happened. While there are a few minor subplots, the main goal of the game is to undo the queen\\'s curse and save your forest. You play as a scrappy priestess who uses a giant leaf and a bow as her weapons of choice. That\\'s all you need to know!\\n\\nThe first thing someone will notice is just how gorgeous the graphics are. Opting to draw from the pastel-coloured layouts and subtle gradients of Cave Story\\'s aesthetic, it adds a dark twist to it by aping Bloodborne to emulate the Gothic dreariness that comprises the majority of this game. So much detail is given to every sprite, environment, down to the particles themselves. The music itself is top notch, subtle enough to not grow annoying while remaining ever present through the gameplay. It does a wonderful job of framing every hub and dungeon to set the right tone and mood.\\n\\nBut where Momodora really shines is in the gameplay itself. The controls are extremely crisp and fluid. Enemy attacks, while quick, are all telegraphed, giving you a good indication of what to expect. Even so, the game never slouches in keeping you on your toes, sharing a semblance to the difficulty of Dark Souls without the frustration that comes with some of the mechanics. The only fault lies in with the player itself; it is up to you to spot traps and enemies and adjust your strategy accordingly. Not to mention, there are numerous items you can get to further augment your own abilities; some you can buy and some you can only get by beating a boss while taking no damage. There is very little artificial difficulty, if any - combined in conjunction with the numerous strategies and item builds, branching paths, secrets, and that sense of wonderment, this game is a rare gem in the cesspool of Steam\\'s indie game library.\\n\\nNot to mention, cute girls!\\n\\n10/10. Pro: Fun Gamepaly, Decent Music, Good bosses\\n\\nCon:Short (Took me about 3 hours to beat) great game buy it Beautiful small platformer. \\nCan Inland recommend it. A fantastic 2D platformer with great controls.\\n\\nThe story is very minimalist, which adds to the beautiful world around the game.\\n\\nGreat artstyle and gameplay aswell as tons of secret rooms, chests and items. \\n\\nGame is rather difficult but if you like a Metroidvania type of game, Get it now.\\n\\n(also, you can play as a cat :>) Great game and art style. Has Metroid/Castlevania and Dark Soul elements. Biggest problem is its length. Maybe they could expand the game? WHY IS THIS GAME SO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED? I mean sure its beautful, but the gameplay feels awful.\\nI started off with, okay this got rave reviews, lets give it some time to get good.\\nThen just trying to power through it until it gets good.\\nThen deciding most of the positive feedback is from the second boss fight.\\nThis is coming from someone that generally loves metroidvania btw. 2d pixel art souls-like metroidvania with amazing music and art.\\n\\nA bit short but still a must buy. Absolutely stunning. From start to end the game keeps you in it\\'s world. \\n\\nIt reminded me a ton of Dark souls while playing, and there was a ton of hidden secrets I couldn\\'t even find on my first playthrough. Really great. \\n\\nOnly con is the length, I got the true ending without guides in about 4 hours, but they were 4 hours I loved all the way, which is more than I can say for most games. \\n\\nBottom line, well worth the price. Highly recommend this game - it can be a bit of a short game depending on how quickly you explore the map and complete the side content, but the \"Dark Souls\" like atmosphere coupled with the Metroidvania styled gameplay and charming pixellated art direction makes the game an absolute blast to play!\\n Fantastic game. I will most defintely check out the other ones Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, is a solid 2d platformer with very impressive pixel art, and an above average combat system. \\nIt has an ok soundtrack and the story / tone do not end as well as they starts but if you can sweep thoose two things under the rug this game is perfect for anyone who likes anything similar to Salt and Sancuarty, in a metroidvania kind of style, just a bit easier.\\nThe 10.00 price tag guarantees a few hours of gameplay but if you think that is too hefty but still want to play other games in the genre I suggest Rouge Legacy, Salt and Sancturary, or Darksouls.\\nOverall Momodora is a really fun and pretty game! This game feels like an extremely solid Metroidvania title, in a similar vein to the Souls (Demon\\'s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne) series.\\n\\nRUtM features extremely tight and precise controls and gameplay, with an excellently natural difficulty curve that is punishing but not unfair or discouraging. While low resolution, the sprites are fantastic with a lot of detail, charm, and nuance behind them. The soundtrack is also phenomenal, helping set the mood for the game\\'s backdrop. The game features a large open ended world, with a large amount of backtracking and exploration as you\\'d expect from the genre, including a large number of shortcuts. (Much akin to Souls titles)\\n\\nOverall I can\\'t recommend this title enough. It feels like there\\'s been a bit of a drought for solid Metroidvanias, and this game has succeeded in delivering something wonderful. The game is charming with a lot of love put into it, and is sure to please any fan of 2d exploration-heavy platformers. Attacking a giant witch by tickling her breasts with a maple leaf...\\n\\n10/10 Best boss fight IGN Hard as fuck metroidvania.\\nGood, as you might expect. Short but sweet. The game\\'s soundtrack, atmosphere and pixelart are stunning. Dark souls inspired 2D platformer / action game. Very well polished. Worth to try it if you like Dark Souls or Megaman Zero. One of the best metriodvaina games i have ever played \\n\\nit feels like a heavy mix of darksouls and Symphony of the Night \\n\\ni had about 8 hours of play but could be more or less depending on how much backtracking and secret hunting you want to do Reminicent of \"Seek audience with...\" and may the good leaf guide you.\\nFINE 3                              FOUL 0 Momodora RutM was a superb and enjoyable game. The art style is beautiful in its simplicity and the combat easy to get into with a good sense of growth.  I felt compelled to 100% the map and I do not do that too often. The game, like any good Metroidvania, rewards you for being thorough and keeping your eyes open. \\n\\nThe item system, harkening to Dark Souls, gives you items that only refresh at save points, which fills you with dread when you know your steady supply of health backups had been depleted with no idea where the next save point is. On that note, being given a real incentive to being decent at the game, in the form of early powerup items if you beat a boss without getting hit, is a great way to make replaying the game as a better player more challenging and rewarding. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that it feels like it went by rapidly. This is one of the shortest Metroidvanias I\\'ve ever played, and I yearn to play more. Thankfully I have options to do so later with NG+, interesting achievements, and some of those achievements compliment the short style wonderfully.\\n\\nI highly recommend giving this game a try. It is well worth the $9.99 price tag, but keep an eye out for sales as well. This is just beautiful. The closest you\\'ll get nowadays to Symphony of the Night! GO. BUY. IT. NOW. <3<3<3 nice game If you like castlevania or dark souls check this out.It\\'s not salt and sanctuary but it does give you enough challenge and has incredible esthetic. Died 15 times in tutorial zone... I love it! If you like Metroidvania games at all, [b]please get this game.[/b] I got it 20% off during the summer sale and it\\'s worth it, sale or no sale.\\n\\nYou play as a preistess named Kaho from a distance village, determined to get rid of the curse spreading across the land. The weapons you get at the start are basically what you have for the rest of the game, and the combat feels really solid. The combat is standard throughout as well; you get to start out as a novice and practice up to being a master by the end of the game.\\n\\nIn terms of graphics, it\\'s all the gorgeous pixel kind, like what Shovel Knight and Stardew Valley has at times. If you like 16-bit graphics like those, that\\'s reason enough to get this game honestly.\\n\\nThe music is really good too. It\\'s super atmospheric and blends well with the gameplay.\\n\\nHonestly, I don\\'t really have anything I could name that would be a turn-off for buying this. All I can do is praise this game. If you\\'ve ever enjoyed a Metroidvania game, or are interested in one, [strike]or just like cats,[/strike] definitely give this game a shot! Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an exploration based adventure platformer game in lieu of the Metroidvania style. You play as Koha, a priestess who\\'s land has been afflicted by a curse, and are searching to find a way to fix it, going to the source.\\n\\nThe gameplay flows together in a nice mix, between the exploration, the combat, and the movement between the 2, with extremely responsive controls (which can be customized to your liking). While I had a few moments where I felt like I had a \"cheap\" death, it was either due to bugs or me being impatient. That is how well it weaves together.\\nIn terms of the exploration aspect in and of itself, it was a joy to find little nooks, crannies, and spaces I couldn\\'t reach before getting some equipment, leading to a nice feel of progression (where I constantly would go \"I remember an area where this new thing could be useful!). Most equipment is merely power-ups and the like, but there is a few things you get that open up new areas (namely the cat ability, which opens a lot of little nooks). Most of the exploration, however, is by your wit and your means to effectively use the tools given to you, between your double jump and other such abilities. Throw in the fact there is very minimal linearity (I found out I faced a boss that most people don\\'t fight until later, but I fought them as the 3rd boss). It is also worth noting there are lots of secrets to find, and good exploration will be rewarded.\\nThe combat also holds pretty well. You have a melee and a range attack with distinct benefits and weaknesses, and mixing the 2 to make an effective combat situation is simply satisfying, whether it is a normal enemy or a boss. When you start getting the hang of things it feels good and flows nicely to go in for a melee combo, back off and fire off a charged bow shot when they attempt to retaliate.\\nThe movement itself merely helps both of these aspects. As I said the controls are nice and responsive, and if you hit a button to go in a direction you will go in that direction, forcing it to be on your skill to make sure it\\'s the right one.\\n\\nThe story itself is interesting, if a little lackluster. Now, I like the concept of being an outsider, who nobody knows, and as such feel like nobody will care for you either. You aren\\'t some kind of \"Chosen one\" or any of that Mary Sue bs. You are a person doing their job nothing more and nothing less. And it is told in a way that doesn\\'t really interrupt gameplay, especially in an industry where a lot of games make you move from one cutscene to the next. However, there are times where fights, characters, etc. and how they play in the story feel a little... anticlimactic. Story Spoiler: [spoiler] Example being Lubella, who is apparently causing a lot of problems, but then after a fight it\\'s just... done. That\\'s it. I\\'m not asking for fanfare or anything, but it feels like I didn\\'t accomplish anything with that.[/spoiler].\\nIe. Great narrative, but a bit more emotional reward after accomplishing anything would be nice. Doesn\\'t have to be positive, but something to make it seem like I did something.\\n\\nThe music and visuals are simply astounding. It\\'s an artpiece to see and listen to. The music can get a bit repetitive sometimes, especially when you get stuck in an area, but it never got annoying. I quite enjoyed listening to the pieces as I went through the world. And each area has a distinct look and it provides a really nice atmosphere.\\n\\nIn terms of difficulty, it\\'s tough but fair. I never felt cheated, but I felt like I had to strive at points on Normal. If I had to compare it to anything, probably would be akin to Late Cave Story difficulty is the opening. Lunatic is only for those who are crazy (like I will be once I attempt it... you have almost no hp, anything instakills you.). If difficulty is a worry for you, don\\'t worry the game is at least lenient in that regards if you play smart and patient.\\n\\nThis game also has some neat touches, namely with bossfights, that keep you on your toes. I just wish they made better use out of this, since it feels like they could have capitalized on this a bit more.\\n\\nWorth noting: It has genuine replayability, be it increased difficulty, trying to find all the things, or simply wanting to get the extra achievements (like play through without dying once...), which are pretty engaging.\\n\\n\\nSo for some quick gripes:\\nI wish that the map screen at least divided the different sections somewhat. There were numerous times I would plan to go to one area, just to find out that the area I\\'m looking for is somewhere else on the map, or connected to something else. Same for the warping ability that warps you to bells, knowing which specific bell in each area I would go to would be appreciated.\\n\\nAnother thing is some bells (which are your save points) feel like they are in very inconvenient places (namely one in the Cinder Chambers area), where if I wanted to save I had 2 options: drop down and have to make a long trek back up, or risk a long journey to a whole different area since there was no others until then.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\\nA very fun Metroidvania game, with a really nice difficulty. The soundtrack and graphics are amazing, and the gameplay holds really well. A few small issues, but it is easy to overlook overall.\\nIf you can get it, I strongly recommend you do if you are a fan of great artworks in the game industry. Fantasic atmostphere, great music, gorgeous art and charming animation, challenging (but fair!) gameplay, tight controls, a story that\\'s interesting while being far more show than tell. The character upgrades are satisfying to earn and use, and don\\'t come off as useless or empty filler. Items you find and gain offer customization for varied gameplay styles, and the difficulty levels available offer enough of a spread to match up with the ability\\'s of most any person so that they can experience the whole of the game they purchased without ending up completely stuck, and even help them along in raising to the challenge of higher difficulties if so desired. There are plenty of little secrets to encourage and reward exploration and challenging yourself to play to your best ability. \\n\\nI bought this game blind having heard of but never played the previous games in the series from rdein and came away incredibly impressed with the quality of the game. Seeing the continued support for translations and the active involvement of the developer in the discussion forum both addressing technical issues and answering game-related questions that people have is super encouraging. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is absolutely worth the price in my mind. I look forward to future games from the team! It\\'s waifu souls, a challenging metroidvania with changeable difficulty levels for those who don\\'t want to take the time to get gud. I enjoyed that it rewarded skilled play by giving you extra items when not getting hit by bosses, and that it felt like a more casual souls experience. I love it being the first metroidvania style game I have played. I was blown away with how much fun I was having defeating bosses and fihgting enemy mobs. I mean who doesn\\'t wanna beat up people with a maple leaf for hours on end. As someone who really enjoyed the Castlevania games for the PS1 and the Nintendo DS, you\\'d figure that I would enjoy this game. And as you guessed, I really enjoyed this game, close to if not just as much as my favorite Castlevania games. \\n\\nAfter playing those games it  always puts a smile on my face to hear the term \"2D Dark Souls\" being coined a lot for games like this. It makes me feel more and more like Dark Souls is a 3D Castlevania. But that\\'s besides the point.\\n\\nI really like this game. My only regret is not paying the full price, as the game deserves every penny it\\'s asking for. It captures everythign I enjoyed about the games I mentioned already and it does so with it\\'s own really neat art style. I was actually surprised to see that this game actually puts some story in between the gameplay, since most games I\\'ve played like this tend to just be all about gameplay with minimum story to bring. \\n\\nI highly recommend this to any platformer fan to play through once. I personally have started playing it again just to see all the details and secrets I might have missed, but I can see others not wanting to do this. It also has a NG+ but I hear that it doesn\\'t add too much other than giving you a reason to play the game again like I have. It\\'s really kind of boring to be straight with you. I played for a little bit and I was pretty disappointed in its gameplay. Just like every other 2D sidescroller dungeon crawler (except for terraria). If you like those games, go ahead! Good story and amazing art, just not too original.\\n\\n(Really all I\\'m asking for is a refund ;-;) 2D souls esc game, fucking great! Great gameplay.  Great Soundtrack.  Replayability.  Medium to Hard difficulty.\\n\\n5/7 Do you like Metroidvanias? Challenging difficulty? Got 10 bucks in your wallet? Momodora:UM is well worth your time. Taking heavy emphasize from games like Metroid/Castlevania and then wrappng them up in a neat beautiful sprite filled package; Momo is simple and fun. \\n\\nIt\\'s got a great story which is easy to get into mostly because it doesn\\'t boggle you down with large amounts of text or cutscenes. The best part is it doesn\\'t require you to play previous  games even if this is the 4th in the series. But you\\'ll most likely want to check them out if you like this game enough! \\n\\nGameplay is super easy to pick up and very responsive. You have a standard jump, roll, and two forms of attacks (Arrows and Melee). Don\\'t let the simplicity fool you though, this is a tough game for the inexperienced; especially on higher difficulties. To help you on your journey though you also have an inventory system which allows the use of both passive and active items, which gives the game very ligh RPG elements. \\n\\nPresentation wise, the graphics are very pleasing and everything pops out enough to give both your character and the enemies a distinct visual definition to know what is going on in all the crazy dodging you\\'ll be doing. The levels themselves do a very nice job at conveying that Castlevania feel in the GBA titles. To go along with it is a soothing and well orchestrated soundtrack that really set the mood for each level/event. \\n\\nThe only downside for this game is that it is a bit short. But that\\'s not to say that there isn\\'t something to do for those who want to pursue a harder difficulty after they\\'re done or even 100% the game. If you really like Metroidvanias and want a little more \\'oomph\\' in your action platformers, you should definitely pick this up. Simply one of the best platformers I\\'ve ever played. Gruelling, witty, and dark; this series proves itself with this title that deserves it\\'s cult status and possibly should be regarded as much more. If you don\\'t own this it is most certainly worth the asking price. Cool art style and you get to slap a giant reindeer witch\\'s tits.\\n\\nIn all seriousness, it\\'s fun and has a cool aesthetic. Edit: Wow, so many downvotes! I guess I clearly must be in the wrong for disliking frequent unpredictable overpowered damage sponges.\\n\\nThis game is a solid action platformer with good exploration that feels nonlinear. The soundtrack provides great atmosphere while playing as well.\\n\\nHowever, I can\\'t recommend this game because of how the moderately frequent boss fights play out. In most games, a boss has some sort of animation or sound cue before they do a powerful attack; [i]this game has none.[/i] Your attacks do petty damage to the boss and the next instant, 80% of your health is gone in one strike because of a boss attack that you literally have no way of anticipating without somehow seeing into the future. \\n\\nYour character does have a ranged attack, but it does very little damage even to regular enemies; I\\'ve tried spamming it and the boss fights just feel like a chore. To add insult to injury, there sometimes isn\\'t a save point before a boss, so when you die you have to trek your way to the boss fight again and again.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost enough to make me put the game down because I don\\'t find myself enjoying it. There are plenty of games that are very difficult and challenging [i]but also fun to play[/i]. To me, this is not one of those games. Very short game, but a very high-quality sidescroller that was enjoyable all the way through. The art is gorgeous, the animations are smooth, the combat feels responsive and impactful... it\\'s well worth the asking price, and this is coming from someone who usually feels like games should provide at least 2 hours of playtime for every $1 spent. This is a perfectly functional metrodvania. Would I recommend it? Ehhhh.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty. The atmosphere is good. It\\'s pleasantly creepy. It is--and you can decide whether this is a plus or a minus--Touhou in a metrodvania game, with a priestess out to murder demon-girls. But:\\n\\n1. The world layout is odd. It\\'s fully non-linear, but it didn\\'t feel like there was a natural flow to how you\\'d explore the world. There\\'s a very linear path that connects the starting area to a plot-important area, and then all the other areas are just kind of stuck under the floorboards somewhere. Yes, yes, it\\'s a metroidvania. It still didn\\'t flow well.\\n\\n2. The difficulty is odd. In \"normal\" mode, the enemies at the beginning of the game can kill you in 2-3 hits. It\\'s a legitimate skill test, because any mistake can kill you. In \"easy,\" you have max health from the beginning, super defense, and hit point regeneration. Whoa!\\n\\n3. There\\'s a thin veneer of story, but it\\'s pretty minimal.\\n\\nSo, eh. It was amusing. It was amusing enough. I don\\'t care enough to get any more achievements, though. Loved the game~ I had a blasty blast with this series. It is long enough that it is well worth the price, and short enough that you don\\'t mind playing through it again to get the achievements. I played it on hard and found it rather challenging (took me 9 hours to finish a blind run with 100%), then I played it on Insanity and realized I didn\\'t know what challenging was. I managed to finish insanity quicker, but I didn\\'t get 100% and I knew enemy patterns and locations, so it was made a little easier. \\n\\nThe controls are solid, the graphics are well done, and the story, while incredibly simple, was told well. \\n\\nCheck this game out! It\\'s well worth the price, and any fan of the Metroidvania sort of games will like this. I played Momodora 3. It was decent. This version however is incredible. What an amazing game! Absolute amazing game to play!I love the CaveStory inspiration, the gameplay feels real fluid and while it can be really hard at times it is an absolute blast! I love the updated artstyle as well, compared to the older versions.I plan to try Momodora III next, I think it also would be really cool to see the first two redone in this quality. If you enjoy Metroidvanie style games, definitely worth a playthrough(~6 hours). Similar to Souls, but a bit easier. Really nice pixel graphics and a wonderfull soundtrack that fits with the theme of the area. Overall very fun. Was expecting a megaman style game.\\n\\nGot pixelated Dark Souls instead.\\n\\n10/10 Would Recommend I mean what can I say about this metroidvania title that has not already been said? It\\'s atmospheric, the controls feel fluid, and if I adjust my difficulty enough I get to hear the shrill screams of Kaho dying over and over again. \\n\\nHaving played momodora I to III, I just really love how the art has improved so drastically over the titles. I cant wait to see what Rdein and the team come up with next! \\n\\nI bought this game on sale, and would have gladly played full price for it. A really good game, based on the few hours I\\'ve played of it so far! If you enjoyed playing Castlevania: SotN, then you will love this. It draws heavily from Symphony (thematically, and the areas feel very much like Bloodborne meets Dracula\\'s castle) and other Metroidvania-type games, but this is definitely a game entirely on its own, and I don\\'t knock it for borrowing tried and true concepts. With a great soundtrack, amazing art style, and a world that is incredibly fun to explore, populated by colorful NPCs..... it makes me feel like I should have paid at least twice more than the asking price. \\n\\nThe gameplay, while it can be frustrating running into those particularly evil projectiles, is smooth and fun and a lot more forgiving than previous Momodora titles. But having very recently gotten into the series, this game alone has confirmed my investment in future installments. I am hoping that a future Momodora release will play even longer. I don\\'t feel that there\\'s much replay value (there are a lot of hidden things and I think there are two endings but I don\\'t quite remember) but the game is seriously great and worth the money. You won\\'t find yourself putting more than 50 hours into it but you\\'ll definitely want to take a look at the three other games. Amazing little game, highly recommended.\\n\\nFor some reason I was under the impression this would be a cute/twee themed game but it\\'s actually p. sombre and morose. The atmosphere, music and visuals are all cool as heck and it feels like a complete metroidvania experience that you can 100% in 5-7 hours. The controls are tight and mastering some of the boss fights without getting hit felt really good. \\n\\nDefinitely buy this if you\\'re in the mood for a short but sweet (& a bit sad) metroidvania game. :] One of the best games in my Steam Library One of the boss\\'s weakpoint is her boobs. What are you waiting for!? I enjoyed the previous Momodora games, but this one isn\\'t even in the same league. Beautiful spritework and a setting that people may have compared to Dark Souls, but that\\'s not really a bad thing. \\nWhile I have little to no gameplay complains, I do kinda find that the story, the little there was, could have been a bit better. From the cover art I thought that some characters would have  a bigger role (or even be playable) but that was never the case. The final boss encounter is also surprisingly disappointing for this game and I think this game deserved a better finale. \\nThat aside, great game! I own hundreds of steam games and haven\\'t reviewed a single one until now. This game is that good. Wonderful music and great art work, you don\\'t want to miss this game. This is a good platformer and skill based gameplay reminiscent of the Castlvania: SOTN and Metroid. Or any other 2D side scrolling you can get. \\n\\nRecommended This is the most fun I\\'ve had playing a video game in a long time. The controls are splendid (I used a controller), the combat system is fast paced and difficult enough that nothing\\'s too easy and the story\\'s not agressively force fed to you. \\nBuy the game. Um, can i just say this game is a perfect 10/10 for what it tries to do? the controls are thight, storytelling, atmosphere, animations everything is on point. struggeling through the game the first time is awesome. You discover secrets, learn about the world you\\'re in, and you really get scared like in dark souls when you don\\'t know if you are gonna make it to the next checkpoint (which are bells AND THAT IS AWESOME because you literally hit checkpoints to save). There is an achievement which requires that you do not kill any common enemy and it\\'s so different how you play when you want to get it. the bosses (which all are unique and epic) drop special items when you kill them without getting hit, these are pretty hard to get but some of them are extremely powerful. It\\'s about as Dark Souls like as a 2D platformer can be, in a good way. Metroidvania + \"Cute/Kawaii\" anime girls art style + a slight influence from Dark Souls = this game.\\n\\nReally wish that it was longer. I like this game. It\\'s like a Cave Story/Dark Souls blend that doesn\\'t make me want to set the world ablaze. It does sometimes, actually.  This is a marvelous game. Sprite quality is astonishing; probably some of the best animation quality in a pixel art game I\\'ve seen in quite a while. The gameplay is fun, and relatively simple, the game itself can be challenging at some points, but after getting used to how things work, it becomes pretty simple. The music is great; quite a few themes I really enjoy. My only complaint is that it sadly is a relatively short game, but I still recommend it, as it\\'s completely worth it, in my opinion. Great game for anyone who enjoys metroidvania games and It has nice aesthetics and soundtracks. If you play on hard there will be some annoying parts, but it is totally worth it! Can turn into a cutesy cat and hit people with a giant leaf.  Perfect. If there was a button between Yes and No I would probably press it on this one, But I do recommend it. It\\'s a beautiful and fun game to play. But I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s worth the full price, It\\'s way too short with only 4-5 play-time and the NG+ doesn\\'t really have anything new in it. You should wait for a sale on this one.\\n\\n Really nice metroidvania-style action game that makes good use of its mechanics and level design while having amazing art and visual design at the same time, took me jjust under 6 hours to complete. I\\'d say it\\'s definitely worth buying if you want a short action game that can be played whenever.\\n\\nAlso cute protag and t i d d y monster boss Great game, sad but cute. Wouldn\\'t recommend it for the full price, though, because it\\'s very short. Wolf\\'s easy guide to fighting giant Undead Witches.\\n\\nStep 1. Locate giant undead witch.\\nStep 2. Locate said witch\\'s chest.\\nStep 3. Hit chest repeatedly with leaf.\\nStep 4. ????\\nStep 5. Profit!\\n\\n10/10.\\n100/100.\\nBest game.\\nBEST GAME!\\n\\nLike 2D Dark Souls with cute waifu material. there was a character that said \"Uguu\", that\\'s enough for me to give the game 10/10 This is a fun and challenging platformer game with beautiful art and an emotional soundtrack. It\\'s filled with all sorts of little secrets, hidden rooms, strange characters, and cute monsters that ambush you at every turn. It\\'s the kind of atmosphere filled with mystery that invites the player to explore everywhere. Controls are a little complex, but easy enough to pick up quickly.\\n\\nFor those familiar with previous Momodora games, this one is probably most similar to Momodora 2 in terms of gameplay, but much larger in scope, less linear, and more meticulous in sprite and background design. \\n\\nWith all the little details attended to, it\\'s clear that this is a work of love by the developers Bombservice. And I enjoy playing it and immersing myself in the world it creates. An overlooked gem. Great spritework, amazing music, solid combat and level design. If you like metroidvanias, I strongly suggest checking this out. This game is great! It is worth to spend your free time and is addictive.\\nGameplay 4.5/5\\nSoundtrack 4.5/5\\nConcept 5/5\\nFeatures 4.5/5\\nI am waiting for the next sequel, in a better graphic love it Go, [b]buy this game[/b] at full price [b]now[/b], if you find yourself even remotely interested in metroidvania-type games.\\n\\n[u]It\\'s just beautiful[/u]\\n\\nColors, backgrounds, character sprites, animations and music: everything flawlessly blends into a stunningly atmospheric and coherent 2D game world. Seriously, Momodora knows its aesthetics. I absolutely loved this aspect of the game! [spoiler](Bonus points for playing as a kawaii priestess with a maple leaf as main weapon and being able to turn into a cat)[/spoiler]\\n\\n[u]Gameplay is simple, yet effective[/u]\\n\\nYou won\\'t find a ton of useless items, spells or use one of many gazillion button input combos. Nope. You\\'ve got your basic melee 3-hit combo, a chargeable bow, 3 active and 2 passive items. Combat works and feels just right!\\n\\nMovement is also tight and responsive: running, jumping, rolling and dashing through the world is a real pleasure!\\n\\n[u]Difficulty[/u]\\n\\nI played on normal difficulty. The game is challenging (especially in boss fights which require you to learn their patterns) but not too unforgiving. Weirdly enough it gets a lot easier towards the end since you find tons of HP upgrades and more powerful items. Looking back I\\'d recommend starting out on Hard.\\n\\n[u]The only downside[/u]\\n\\nAfter roughly 5 hours playtime I\\'m standing before the final boss, 99% of the map is cleared and I don\\'t want the game to end yet.\\nSeriously, it\\'s too short :( Beautiful little Metroidvania platformer. Game feels good to play, music is good, art is good, just wish there was a little more to the world/story and some more complexity to the enemies and bosses. There was very little in the way of interesting world traversal options. There were only two abilities that could open new doors/paths, and both seemed as though they were additions instead of core parts of the game. With regard to the enemies: moreso than other games, I felt like I was either cheaping the bosses out or just wailing on a damage sponge. There were some interesting enemy configurations, but nothing to write home about. I wouldn\\'t call the combat bland, but it could use some work.\\n\\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time with it, and am excited to see what the dev brings next. Solid 7/10 from me. This is one of my all time favourite games. Short but worth every cent, fun boss battles and gorgeous visuals. As soon as I finished it I played through it again, and again. It\\'s just that sort of game. 10/10 would recommend to anyone interested in a casual but challenging side scroller. A beautiful looking game oozing with atmosphere. Tight controls, smart enemy placement, and hard as nails. Main character is odd enough to be memorable (priestess that fights with a maple leaf), but isn\\'t TOO odd. Bosses are interesting enough in terms of design (the boss fights are decent enough). Some \"sub weapons\" you receive feel a bit too strong at times, but are rewards for beating bosses without taking damage. This is also countered by the difficult nature of the game, especially on Hard and Insane difficulty. So \"sub weapons\" that seem over powered quickly seem fair enough.\\n\\nOne thing I can\\'t stand, which seems to be present in many metroidvania-ish games, is different endings. For some this equates to more replay value. For me, it\\'s a nuisance. I made it to the final boss, let me beat the game. But I guess backtracking to get one item to get the true ending is \"\"good gameplay???\"\" At least you get warps, which makes backtracking less of a nuisance, but ultimately feels arbitrary. \\n\\nI also found myself not being that engaged with the characters or the overall plot. The game has wonderful polish and atmosphere, but I was left wanting something more to chew on. \\n\\nThe good definitely outweighs the few nitpicks I had though, and I definitely recommend throwing your monies at it.\\n\\n8/10 Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th [Yes, 4th] game in the Momodora series. Not that I\\'ve really played the first 2 yet.\\nBut I played Momodora 3, which got me into the series to begin with. Enough about that though. Let me properly review this game.\\nFor starters, the sprites look MUCH better in this than in 3. This game has more story than 3, and the music, Sweet cheese and crackers. The MUSIC is better than the 3rd.\\nHowever... Even if I liked this game more than what I mentioned a bajillion times before, it doesn\\'t mean its the best game I\\'ve ever played. [That goes to Freedom Planet]\\nI\\'m not gonna name out the few flaws it has, for times sake. I\\'m gonna let you play it to decide.\\nOverall rating; 7.3/10. Great game This here is a fuckin\\' MASTERPICE.  It\\'s like Dark Souls with little girls or Metroid with a kitten. where medium is hard and easy is to easy You can turn into a cat\\nand if you crouch you go into a playful pounce position\\n\\n11/10 game of the year edition wow\\nmountain dew [list]\\n    [*]cute pixelated characters\\n    [*]you fight using a maple leaf\\n    [*]also the game is awesome\\n    [*]and cat ball\\n[/list]\\n\\n One of the greatest MetroidVania titles I\\'ve played to date, I completed my first play through on Hard in just under 10 hours.\\n\\n- Art: Love it! Take a look at the screenshots, they are wonderful\\n\\n- Music: I didn\\'t feel like there were many tracks, but definitely loved the music when it was playing. Never felt like it was repetitive and kind of wanted to just leave it playing for a while in the background... when I would go to an area without music, I was sad :\\'( Truly incredible, I bought the soundtrack.\\n\\n- Level Design: Very similar to Dark Souls (in good ways).\\n - There are a few, carefully placed looping shortcuts (think Dark Souls 1)\\n - You rest at Bells (think Bonfires) to recover consumable items, like your Bellflowers (Estus flasks) and other consumable items (like spells)\\n - Illusory walls - they\\'re out there, even early on... check your map often. If something doesn\\'t seem to make sense, start hitting the walls!\\n - Locations you can\\'t get to now, but can return to later. Specifically, small passages. This is more like Metroid, to be honest, but is still a great design decision.\\n\\n- Gameplay/Combat: Fantastic and very satisfying\\n - No parry/block, but there is dodge/roll - think Bloodborne, sort of. Opponents are physical objects you cannot pass through unless you are rolling. While rolling, you cannot be hit, but if your roll stops while you\\'re \\'in\\' an enemy, you will take damage.\\n - Melee - you fight with a leaf. Stick with me here! It\\'s a 3-5 hit combo that is beautifully designed and causes the enemy to be stunned. Your attacks can effect multiple enemies at once and there is some knockback/knock-up in the process. Jump attacks do more damage, also.\\n - Ranged - Arrows are great. You can quickly fire off single arrows (though there is a random throttle on how many you can pump out... encouraging you to charge instead, I guess?). You can also charge arrows up to a scatter-shot burst (up close to shot-gun the enemy, which will take out most common enemies in the game).\\n\\nI will keep an eye on this dev for any and all future products they release. Am totally blown away by the quality and design. This is EXACTLY what a great game needs to look like. No frills, no BS, you are at the whim of your own wits, and the meager handful of abilities and power-ups you nab along the way. You are not spoon-fed a story or just playing hop-scotch with the keyboard to get to the next movie, you have to infer a few things for yourself. It\\'s there, and it\\'s rich. And a little heartbreaking. But very, very beautiful.\\n\\nI have friends who tell me, \"oh, Skyrim, I\\'ll be playing that forever.\" Sure it\\'s a game of 100+ hours, but if you distill the monotony of crap like character customization (aka lazy developers), level grinding (aka fake replayability), item creation (aka cooking class) and complex tech trees you never use half of, that game gets boiled down to probably 20 hours tops. At least, that\\'s what it feels like to me. Suffice to say, if there is a distinct lack of reason that compels me to play, that game has an expiration date long before 100 hours. And don\\'t even get me started on MMOs. It\\'s pretty much, \"click on an enemy and push this sequence of number keys and win. Ok do it again. Ok do it again.\" They\\'re all boring. Scrap all of that and play a real game today.\\n\\nNow I\\'ll grant you, in this genre with these kinds of platformers, they usually make the difficulty ridiculous. Nigh unapproachable, save the ninja elites. This isn\\'t. This is hard, but not so hard you don\\'t feel like you\\'re getting better, or can\\'t figure it out, or just try a different strategy and it will work. With my mediocre skills, the items you do get are JUST enough, and I like that you don\\'t always have to go to a store or farm items to replenish your supplies. I will say though, Fennel is ALWAYS a pain in the rear. But I\\'m not even knocking that, she\\'s just the illustration of why impatient people (me) will struggle with this game. There was only about 2 spots where it felt \\'remotely\\' dirty the way I died, falling into a pit of spikes. But when I slowed down just a bit, and paid a little more attention, it was no trouble at all.\\n\\nPlay this game. \"Recommended\" is such a drastic understatement of how great it really is. Enjoy. good Estus Flasks? Check.\\nBonfires? Check.\\nIllusory walls? Check.\\nElevators activated with pressure switches? Check.\\n\"This door does not open from this side\"? Check.\\n\\nBest 2D Souls game I\\'ve ever played. This was one of the best I\\'ve played in a long time. Good sound, visuals, and control. It was pretty hard but most importantly an amazing ride all the way through. lol 90 percent of the time i am dieing by the dang spikes -_- good game in style of a castlevania \\n Real solid game. The movement physics and visuals are top notch, historically relevant achievements. Required reading for anyone interested in the form. Hopefully Igarashi\\'s team are assigned playtime with this game as homework. Wonderful game with a great art style \\n\\nPros:\\nfun story\\ngood music\\nfun as fuck bosses\\nnice item finds\\ndangerous enemies\\n\\nneutral(some people won\\'t like these bits i personally didn\\'t mind):\\nareas kind of blend into each other like taking a left in one area will lead you to the deep part of another area\\nno real signal that you are about to run into a boss\\ncheckpoints\\n\\nCons:\\nactually im kind of hard pressed to find any with being super nitpicky if i had to say one itd be\\nspikes = insta death\\n\\nif you wanna see some gameplay you can check it out here (link to playlist) so you can see what hte game looks and plays like\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Nbi_vzkR1I&list=PLOELHXUhB6rmw6R36MttWZXiabuDr9f4b I loved it. These types of games are generally not what I\\'m used to playing or usually play, but I absolutely adored this game. \\n\\nThe combat system had a really nice flow, the inventory and item system was perfect, the music was amazing and the variety was brilliant. I loved every minute of this game.\\n\\nI highly recommend this if you\\'re up for a challenge, regardless of whether or not you play these types of games. I just loved it. 10/10 10/10 new favorite game plz buy Beautiful art and music. The retro feeling combined with simple battle mechanic though challenging = The Perfect Combination. I am amazed and I am very lucky to stumble upon this game. My nostalgic feeling of Megaman returned with the combination of Bloodborne feeling into this game just makes it even better.\\n\\n10/10 The game has a beautiful art style and a terrific soundtrack. The combat is impressive and rewards you for playing smart. It\\'s almost like a 2D Dark Souls, especially when played on Hard or Expert. \\n\\nThe locations are varied and interesting, and there\\'s enough collectibles (that are well hidden) to make exploring the environment rewarding.\\n\\nThe story is pretty straightforward, but it\\'s still interesting. The story doesn\\'t get in the way of the gameplay, and instead is sprinkled throughout the world in such a way that you don\\'t have to learn anything about it if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\nHighly recommend to anybody that enjoys 2D games like Metroid, Castlevania, or games that focus on the ability of the player, like Demon Souls/Dark Souls. Amazing game loved it! \"Thank you for playing!\"\\n\\nF*** you.\\n\\nThank you for making a great game.\\n\\n<3\\n\\nTime for a pacifist run. There aren\\'t enough great Metroidvania games out there (yet), but this one is definitely worthy of praise. I played through the game on Hard and NG+ and was pleasantly challenged. The game clearly takes inspiritation from the Dark Souls series and applies it to the classic metroidvania formula in a way that ends up feeling really solid. The difficulty is there but like Dark Souls it is presented in such a way that you can learn from your mistakes and don\\'t feel too frustrated (most of the time at least). There are plenty of secrets to find and it seems like there might even be multiple endings, though I\\'ve only found one so far. The power-ups feel impactful and the consumables refresh their charges at save points (think Estus from Dark Souls). The consumables were never explained however, so I went through most of my first run without ever using them.\\n\\nAll in all I really enjoyed this game, and plan on running through it again. Hope to see more games like this from the developer in the future. I might consider checking out some of the previous titles in the series as well. An one-of-a-kind 2D castlevania style platformer with amazing artwork, an eye catching story, tactical yet simple combat, and addicting overall gameplay. Buy it, you won\\'t regret it. Short but truly excellent Metroidvania with some Dark Souls flavour. Liked everything about it except for the giant breast boss. I am eagerly anticipating a sequel. rdein has a better understanding of what made dark souls great than the developers of dark souls 2 The combat, music, and art are very high quality. It\\'s pretty fun and casual. It\\'s way too easy and simply to be called a \"2d dark souls\" though. This recommendation is NOT a rating, it is simply what it is, a buying recommendation based on my overall enjoyment of the game.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Very nicely animated.\\n    [*]Good art direction, nice art work.\\n    [*]Nice music tracks that don\\'t get on your nerves.\\n    [*]Plays okay (it\\'s not, say, Castlevania: Symphony of the night, but definitely not bad either.)\\n    [*]No game breaking bugs during my playtime.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThe Not So Good:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Useless double jump (seriously, why is it even in the game in this state?)\\n    [*]Hard to spot insta-kill areas.\\n    [*]Outdated damage model (do enemies really need to damage the player when you touch them? Even though they have attack states? I had hoped we could have left this Vampire Killer/Castlevania bullcrap damage model in the 80\\'s.)\\n    [*]Getting hit pushes the character in a stun while being flung in the air (again, that 80\\'s damage model), this becomes a problem when fighting enemies or bosses in areas where \\'the floor is lava\\', as when you get hit but tried to do a dodge roll, will result in you flying of into the instakill areas of the map, seeing the air dash is on the same button mapping.\\n    [*]Bad difficulty settings curve (Easy is insultingly easy, normal is hard, and hard will make you want to smack your controller against the wall.)\\n    [*]Bosses have attack states in which they are not on the playing field (basically invulnerability states) so your damage buffs time out before you could properly use them while you got to play dodge ball.)\\n    [*]Bosses are not challenging, they are an exercise in perseverance and patience, as all the bosses for some reason needed to be bigger bullet sponges than bosses in Borderland’s ultimate vault hunter mode.\\n    [*]Healing items simply heal too little, the fact you need to use 3 to even fill the standard health bar shows a lack of balancing (especially with the amount of damage even the lowest level enemies do.)\\n    [*]A lot of stat boosting items are just fluff, what use is a 50% damage boost when a boss has such a massive health pool it will feel like you’re swinging a wet baguette instead of a sword anyway, same goes for the bow, why have arrows that will pierce through enemies and keep flying when there is almost never a situation where so many enemies are on screen (in a straight line no less) where that would be beneficial.\\n    [*]Not enough to actually do in the world, sure you can backtrack and collect some useless worms, but there simply isn’t that much to explore and discover.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\nNow, that ‘bad’ list seems to offset the good by a large margin, but it is also very dependent on what I find annoying and unnecessary for modern action platformers.\\nThis game borrows a lot from late 80\\'s early 90\\'s platformers, and quite frankly, i\\'ve played those, and a lot of stuff from those games always annoyed me (player and enemy hitbox overlap always damaging the player, not both, for example), and I had hoped we could have evolved a bit from those outdated gaming mechanics, but for some reason every \\'retro\\' styled game somehow needs to tick of those checkboxes on the \\'metroidvania\\' must have game mechanics list.\\nAnd that’s a shame, as the game does a lot of stuff right, and with a little more balancing, better designed items and better difficulty settings, it might have been a lot more entertaining to me, unfortunately, I find I have little fun playing it.\\n\\nSo, to iterate, it’s not a bad game per-se, but, up to a certain point it just doesn’t do it for me anymore. Now, if you have no problem with those outdated (or oldskool, depending on your preference) mechanics then by all means, get this game, if not, maybe avoid it (or atleast at full price.)\\n\\n\\nAs for my recommendation, in all honesty, i wish Steam offered a neutral option, as it truly isn\\'t a bad game, and recommendations are more often than not seen as a Metacritic style score/rating of either 10 or 0, which it isn\\'t. Classic Metroidvania-style game, a treat for fans of \"Bunny Must Die\" and similar games. The design and controls are very similar to the good old \"Switchblade\". Certain characters seem to be inspired by Tsukuyomi anime and the like. Lovely mesmerising background music. A bit too pixelated for my taste, but still sweet graphics. Overall, not *very* challenging, quite relaxing game. this is the dark soul\\'s of games with cute anime girls in them\\ni died a lot it was fun, Momodora III was amazing, and one of the few games I took the time to 100% and collect all the achievments for. Gotta say, Reverie Under the Moonlight manages to be even better. They really took the time to polish combat down to a brilliant shine, and it is just fun to play. Item combination keep things fresh and let you change up your style for the situation, animation is fluid and beautiful, and the boss fights are amazing. I also wouldn\\'t be surprised if some enemy and boss designs were partially inspired by Dark Souls because some of those fights really invoke that series. If you want a good Metroidvania style game with emphasis on combat that you can finish up in about 5 hours, this is the game for you. Though you should put in the extra couple of hours to 100% the map and meet the developers! The game\\'s graphical style is okay, and its exploration is mediocre for a Metroidvania style game. The mechanics are simultaneously imprecise and unforgiving, with combat that feels sloppy and ungratifying. The NPCs each tell you a few lines when you talk to them, and the lines feel shoe-horned in with no particular rhyme or reason. The enemies are fairly varied, and have a good mix of styles. The bosses are unimaginative and frustrating. Finally, the sound quality varies a lot, but never gets better than “average for 1995”, and frequently so bad that you’ll want to mute it (the character death and mage magic sounds in particular). This game was recomended for me from Dust: An Elysian Tail and Ori and the Blind Forest. It was not realy what I was looking for. If you like games that are more of platformers I would not recomend this game. This little gem of a game was something I bought on a whim out of curiosity- the game looked nice enough and it was cheap. It\\'s truly a masterpiece; the graphics are gorgeous, movement and combat is fluid and gracefully executed, the bosses are fantastic [and challenging], the music is lovely and well fitted to the atmosphere of the game, and the NPC\\'s as few as they are are lovable. The only real complaint is that the game is rather short and I desperately want more. Works best with a controller. Buy this game. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight or Momodora 4 is a short but sweet metrodvania styled tale of a shrine maiden who\\'s tasked with cleansing the world of evil. \\n\\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\\n+ The pixel art style looks great. I\\'m not usually a fan of pixel art style but for some reason I love the look here.\\n+ The audio and music are a treat and they feel eerie at times\\n+ The combat is much improved from the previous Momodora games. This time, you can actually perform combos with your titular primary weapon the leaf. Accompanying your primary you also have a bow as a secondary weapon which replaces your charms from the previous. Equip-able items also makes a return with some added stat based benefits like add poison to attacks. You also have a dodge roll which allows you to roll through enemies at close range. Learn to master this as it\\'s essential in boss battles.\\n+ The gameplay is challenging, I played on Normal and found that there was a good mix of challenge.\\n+ Fun and memorable boss battles. In the previous games some boss battles were kind of unfair a bit but now they\\'ve improved quite a bit.\\n+ The achievements, if you\\'re up for it seem like a blast to attain.\\n+ Controls are nice and tight and extremely responsive. No slippery nonsense here.\\n\\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\\n- There\\'s no indication of how long you can stand in poison gas before you\\'re poisoned. Though minute it\\'s still applicable.\\n- The map needs to be more legible with markings for what area is which. Often times you\\'d get confused as to which area is which when attempting to warp.\\n\\n[h1]Irritations[/h1]\\n+/- Boss can break out of their \"hitstun\" with no warning causing you to take unnecessary damage. Even though this can be avoid it\\'s really annoying when it happens.\\n+/- Your jump height feels too small often times you have to use your double jump or jam down on the button too hard just to ensure you get the extra height.\\n+/- Can\\'t warp to every bell in the game only a select few. The can prolong the backtrack quite a bit.\\n+/- A bit short but I rather it be short, sweet and fun than introduce filler for the sake of it.\\n\\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\\nThis is without a doubt the best in the series so far. It combines aspects of 2 and 3 with a tiny bit of Souls and a lot of SoTN for a fantastic game. Even though the game is short around 6 hours on Normal it doesn\\'t fill like it\\'s filled with any filler type bits nor does it overstay its welcome. I must say it\\'s one of my favourite games for the year so far. This game was fucking good. Although it\\'s a relatively short game, Momodora was an awesome metroidvania game. Both the story and characters were interested and created a lively (or deadly) world for the player to explore. There are some locations that may change over the course of the game, such as what happens to the [spoiler]girl crying in Karst City[/spoiler]. With brutal enemies and responsive combat, I\\'d recommend this game to anyone interested in a difficult platformer. Momodora is definitely a game to be experienced and savoured, as well as simply played; and I\\'m very glad I did.\\n\\nVisuals-\\nIn my opinion where Momodora stands out is it\\'s story and atmosphere, and it gets them spot on. The whole game is visually rich, from outlying forest to the dark, foreboding city. The dark and earthy pallet combined with subtle uses of vivid colour set the mood for the game very well. The animations are also very smooth and all seem to flow nicely, which makes the timing needed for the gameplay a lot easier (more on that later). \\n\\nSound and Music-\\nThis games soundtrack is stunning, simple as that. Without spoiling too much detail, you will get into a fight inside a monastery, and this is one of the few occasions where I have  paused the game to just listen. I think it may be both my favorite scene and battle in the entire game, and the music plays a major part in that.\\n\\nStory-\\nStory wise the game is deliberately vague, leaving you to push through to your goal and piece together information as you go. What little information you are given at the beginning is that the city is under the effect of a curse, that is now spreading to your homeland, and you have been sent to meet with the lands queen and find some way to end it. You meet very few people in the cursed city on your way, and nearly all of them leave a lasting impression.\\n\\nGameplay-\\nDespite all this the game is not a walk in the park by any means. The gameplay is surprisingly challenging throughout, and some trial and error is definitely needed. You know that favourite fight I previously mentioned? One of the reasons I got the chance to listen to that music so much was because that fight was kicking my sweet ass all kinds of ways. So much so that several attempts at it where simply an exercise of learning the bosses movement and vulnerabilities. \\n\\nThe games difficulty definitely encourages observation and timing, and blindly attacking will get you sent back to a save point quickly. However, as your reactions improve and you learn more about the enemies, these same challenges become noticeably easier, leaving a strong sense of achievement. Helpful trinkets and improvements scattered through the game also make difficult encounters more manageable, meaning leaving a fight for later and searching elsewhere is a valid (and sometimes advised) alternative.\\n\\nOverall, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is definitely a game I recommend. The game may be short (about 6 hours for my first playthrough), but it is definitely worth experiencing for the metroid-vania fan looking for a dark tale, a beautiful world, and a challenge. This game is... amazing.\\nBefore I had bought this game, I had seen a small amount of gameplay and thought it looked pretty fun.\\nFun was an understatement.\\nI have never even played a metroidvania title before, and I feel like this game acts as a good introduction into the genre.  I love exploring every single nook and cranny to find all of the secrets and hidden collectables.  It\\'s also a fun game for casual gamers and hardcore gamers alike, as there are a variety of difficulties to choose from depending on if you want a more relaxing playthrough to experience just the story or if you want a more difficult challenge (this game isn\\'t easy).  The art style is amazing and the soundtrack is atmospheric and ambient.  The boss fights are fun and the few puzzles that there are can provide quite the challenge.  It\\'s not too long of a game, but it\\'s still worthwhile to buy it.\\n\\nMy rating for this game is 10/10.  I would highly recommend picking it up.  (I grabbed it on sale but it\\'s worth full price) At first I found the game quite hard. However, once I got used to the combat system, it became almost a bit too easy. Boss fights were easy to win normally, so I tried to win every boss fight without taking any damage since that there is a reward for not taking any damage + made it much much harder. \\n\\nThis is not to say the game is bad or not worth getting. I really enjoyed playing this game. I especially love the graphic and the combat system. Controls were responsive. I look forward to future games made by this developer. I bought this game on a whim, I had some spare money in my steam wallet and I saw it pop up and found the artstyle interesting.  Saw a video on youtube that described the game as a metroidvania meets dark souls style game so by that point I was already sold on the idea.  So I played the game.  And I died a lot.  And you know what?  None of those deaths felt cheap to me, which is more than I can say about Dark Souls (cough cough).  I beat the game in a little over 3 hours, although I didn\\'t bother checking every nook and cranney for secrets.  In my opinion these guys did an amazing job mixing the metroidvania style exploration with dark souls style combat.\\n\\nPros:\\nAwesome art style.  The animations of the player character and enemies alike are amazing.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is quite good, especially the boss themes.\\n\\nThe controls are pretty responsive.  I played with a keyboard + mouse and the only issues I had were with dodge (Q), use item (E) and swap item (W).  It could have just been a person issue, but something to consider.\\n\\nCons(subjective):\\n\\nThe game is difficult.  If you don\\'t like the idea of a dark souls-esque metroidvania, you may want to get a second opinion.\\n\\nThe combat, despite being dark soulsy, is pretty simple.  You have a three hit melee combo, and you have a bow that you can charge up to 3 levels.  That\\'s it.  There are no fancy combos you can do, so combat comes down to either staggering everything to death with melee, or cheese bosses with the bow.\\n\\nBranching off of combat, bosses drop items if you manage to kill them without getting hit.  The issue with that?  Bosses don\\'t always stagger when you melee them, and in the middle of a melee combo it can be hard to see the boss\\' tells that they\\'re gonna attack.  Also collision damage is a thing, except for when you\\'re attacking and a little tiny bit after you finish your 3 hit combo.  This isn\\'t a huge deal, as the items you get from perfecting most bosses can be found/bought instead.  Problem is I hear a few of these boss items can ONLY be gotten from perfecting those bosses, so if you miss out?  You\\'re SoL. Tight controls, tons of well hidden secrets, large variety of common enemies and boss fights. All of these elements are combined to make a great metroidvania game. I loved this game to bits and I can\\'t wait for the next game. Fourth entry in the Momodora series that combines the Metroidvania aspect of the second entry with the refined ARPG combat of the third. It also ditches the small chibi porportioned sprites of the previous games and replaces them with more realistically porportioned ones(an improvement in my eyes).  By far the best game in the series(they keep improving with each entry) and a recommeded title for any Metroidvania fan(those who enjoyed the Castlevania ones will especially dig this one). Fun, short (about four hours) metroidvania with beautiful sprite art and an atmospheric setting. Really tight controls and fluid movement. Just a nice, casual platformer with a reasonable price point.\\n\\nYou probably shouldn\\'t buy this if you\\'re on a budget and need to stretch your hours/dollar but if you\\'re a fan of the genre and have a saturday night to kill I say definitly go for it!\\n\\n+ Controls/Movement\\n+ Adjustable difficulty\\n+ Atmospheric\\n+/- Short\\n- Story (If you don\\'t actually have a story, just cut it out completely)\\n- Not very inspired platforming. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an excellent Metroidvania, mixing up a fantastic soundtrack, really fluid sprite work, amazing boss battles, engrossing (and well developed) sub-lore, and high level Game Design. It is quite a surprise to see such an amazing piece of work on this sub-genre (not many times seen on western indie development circles) popping up on Steam.\\n\\nLast game i\\'ve played some game from this genre with comparable quality was Touhou Scarlet Family.\\n\\nHighly recommended!!! Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie 2D open-world action platformer spun-off from the main three numbered Momodora entries. You play as Kaho, a priestess who has come to the city of Karst to stop the spread of a curse that has affected her homeland. Armed with a magical leaf and a bow, she seeks an audience with the Queen to find away to put a stop to the curse.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve noticed, I\\'ve tried hard to not describe this game as a Metroidvania. This is because I do not believe it is one, contrary to what the Steam Tags say. The key components of a Metroidvania, as compared to a Metroid, is the presence of an RPG system (leveling, numbered stats/attributes and an equipment screen). Momodora doesn\\'t have a leveling system, but it does have an accessories system which grants some special passive effects, such as automatically attracting dropped money or allowing arrows to pierce through multiple enemies. Kaho\\'s sole source of power growth are Max Health pickups hidden around the world, and story-critical items that grant additional utility and power to Kaho\\'s basic powerset, such as being able to dodge in mid-air or being able to charge the bow to a higher level, both gained through exploration furthering parallels to Metroid.\\n\\nSpeaking of the gameplay, it is much more Symphony of the Night than Metroid, mainly because Kaho hits things with her leaf as opposed to shooting things with an arm cannon. With an emphasis on melee combat, combined with snappy movements and a good degree of aerial control, techniques like short hop attacks or retreating aerial attacks/charged bow shots, combat feels both very technical and tactica. And you are encouraged to use those techniques, even basic enemies deal a lot of damage so you have to fight smart and not just wade into a throng of enemies, at until you are familiar with what each enemy is capable of. Of course, with such hard hitting enemies Kaho needs a couple of boons to help her survive. First is the dodge roll, which grants a fair amount of i-frames (invincibility frames) and can be used immediately after landing a hit, cancelling any recovery frames and allowing you to narrowly escape retaliation. The second is the leaf\\'s property to make most enemies flinch upon a single attack. This is the reason why short hop attacks are preferable to landing the first hit rather than starting a combo on the ground, ground attacks have a bit of a windup whereas aerial attacks have a longer range and you retain forward momentum. It\\'s these small techniques that made combat very enjoyable for me. And with the ability to continue charging your bow (for higher damage or multiple arrows) while attacking or jumping (dodge rolls break your bow charge), there\\'s a lot to juggle and I never felt bored.\\n\\nI\\'ll briefly cover the item system, so along with equipping two accessories you can equip up to three items that you can switch between while out and about. These items have to be used to have any effect (obviously), and range from healing, to buffs, and to spells. However, all your items recharge their uses when you hit a save point. That\\'s right, the item system is similar to Dark Souls 1 and 2. Just a heads up in case you\\'re wondering if you have any worries of running out of items, as this system will likely change how you play the game.\\n\\nKarst City does a very good job of portraying a hopeless situation. Besides the deceptive first area and another area later in the game, the general colour scheme of areas are darker shades of grey, off and muted colours to really push the decrepit atmosphere of a place abandoned by people with average lives. Most of the population have turned into mad phantoms by the curse and out to kill or drive away anyone who aren\\'t similarly disaffected by the grim circumstances. There are a few NPCs you meet along the way, but they also display a lack of hope, despite putting on a brave or aloof front. I guess you could say that the atmosphere is reminiscent of the Soulsbourne series (though I find those games just a tad goofy).\\n\\nI\\'d like to take a few sentences to praise the artstyle. It\\'s very clear that it takes its influence from Cave Story. Good pixel art is really hard to do. Good pixel art with such smooth animations is even harder. I can\\'t quite tell how it was done, some of it is a little [i]too[/i] fluid. But whether it was done by tracing over and touching up a 3d model, or it was just painstakingly drawn pixel by pixel, or it uses some amazing pixelation filter (perhaps even combination of the three for different entities in the world, such as the tufts of grass in the forest area), the end result is a joy to look at. Not to mention that it\\'s true pixel art, no squashing, stretching or rotating of low resolution sprites (think Terreria, where \"pixels\" would often be displayed at non-cardinal directions), all the art was done at a consistent pixel density and outputted at a specific resolution to look good. There\\'s a few other games who do the same thing, obviously Cave Story (and Kero Blaster from the same developer) and Shovel Knight. It\\'s always nice to see someone commit to true pixel art.\\n\\nMomodora is a great game, though it is a little short for a Metroid-like. My hard playthrough took me about 6-8 hours which probably inflated my time played as bosses could kill me in a single hit, but that\\'s okay, it never felt unfair as their attacks are ofetn telegraphed with a circle graphic (think Metal Gear Rising\\'s eyeshine effect). If you are in to Mtroidvanias--even if I don\\'t think this is one--it shares enough DNA that you would probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it, and at $10 I think that\\'s a pretty good proposition. Momodora is a great game, although albeit with some (incredibly minor) flaws.\\n\\n-The lack of weapons beyond the leaf and bow. For pretty much of your entire journey these two things will be your bread and butter and while that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing, some different weapons would be nice. \\n\\n-The lack of weapon upgrades. The bow can be given an extra charge and a boosted charge/fire rate alongside a multitude of effects. The bow is fine, it\\'s the leaf that\\'s the problem. It only has one upgrade and that\\'s for story purposes. As a result bashing monsters with the exact same leaf but in a different color might bore some players. Again, different weapons would be nice but does not really ruin the game.\\n\\n-Combos. What combos? Other than the standard 1-2-3-Finisher there\\'s no button combinations, no fancy attacks, just bash bash bash finisher. Again, that\\'s not bad but since one of the things touted about this game is about it\\'s combos well y\\'kinda raise people\\'s expectations.\\n\\nOkay enough of the nitpicking, let\\'s talk about everything else.\\n\\n+Difficulty: On normal, the game provides an ample enough of challenge to not become boring while not hard enough for a player to simply give up. There are of course, different difficulties to amp it up or lower. Personally it\\'s just fine as is although now with some experience with the game, perhaps I should try it on hard?\\n\\n+Music: Most of the game\\'s music is atmospheric, though that\\'s not to say it\\'s bad oh no it\\'s great! Each track fitting the tone of the current situation, it works so well with the game. However, it does mean some of the tracks can\\'t stand out on it\\'s own but still they\\'re great to listen.\\n\\n+Combat: The dodge roll mechanic (And then later on, the airdash.) just makes the combat incredibly fluid. Dodging around nimbly, firing arrows or battering away at a foe, it makes the fights very engaging. Kaho has a double jump which not only makes platforming easier but also gives her better air control in fights. Gripping and tight, the combat is simply excellent.\\n\\n+Story; Dialoguewise, not much is said. However, the game tells it story through it\\'s atmosphere rather than it\\'s words. There are times where an explaination would be nice or dialogue would\\'ve helped but overall the direction the game took was better for it, allowing the player to come to their own conclusions.\\n\\n+Adventuring/Exploring?: One of the reasons why people love Metroid, Castlevania, and the rest of it\\'s ilk, is for it\\'s exploration. Finding items becoming stronger as result. Or revisiting areas to pick up items you couldn\\'t get before due to lacking a certain item. Well it\\'s all here folks and thanks to the teleportation mechanic, exploring does not feel like a chore. It is in fact, quite enjoyable watching your curiosity being rewarded whether it be through an item or boosting your health. The game actively encourages the player to explore by teasing possible hidden routes which I wholeheartedly support.\\n\\n+Platforming: Again, the airdash and double jump makes platforming quite forgiving. You die as a result of your own mistakes, not the game screwing you over whether it through cheap enemy placement or through a stiff character. (Unlike the Belmonts.)\\n\\n+Control: The controls be adjusted yes but that\\'s not what I want to talk about. Kaho responds extremely well to the player\\'s control, not once have I died to irresponsive button inputs. The control is one of the most no brainer yet also the biggest thing that could make or break a game and they hit it out of the park.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT:\\n\\n10/10.\\n\\nThe game is excellent and aside from some incredibly minor issues, the game is simply amazing. A must have for any fan of the Metroidvania genre.\\n RUTM is a wonderful game with amazing art. Many areas and enemies in the game caught me off gaurd with the stuning pixel art. Moving on, the combat of the game is fairly simple, but also enjoyable. When fighting against some enemies and bosses it may have been hard to tell exactly where to dodge but none of the hits ever felt unfair. The game was however, a bit on the short side. Luckily, because of just how genuinely fun the game is, I found myself replaying it multiple times while speedrunning and get some of the harder achievements. The music doesn\\'t stand out that often but there are some tracks, such as the song that plays when fighting Pardoner Fennel, that really take the cake.\\n\\nIn short if you like fun, quick games with a good amount of replayability, and a soundtrack that knows when it\\'s time to shine, you will get many many hours out of this wonderful game.  This game was the perfect length for what it was, any shorter would have been too short any longer it would have started to get boring. The controls are good, there\\'s some sweet power ups, and some really good secrets. I liked the old school graphics style and the boss fights were about perfect difficulty. I think it could have used a couple more weapons and skills(like wall jump) but all in all it as pretty sweet. 8/10 Some of my top favorite games land in the Metroidvania genre and the souls series, and  you\\'ll see their influence on this title, but with it\\'s own layer of badassery on top. The combat is satifying, the items and really unique, the environments and exploration are great, and theres no such thing as a trash mob here.\\n\\nI had never heard of nor seen this game prior to a few days ago on steam when I noticed it was on sale and had Overwhelmingly Positive but it\\'d just released this week, So I decided to check the trailer out... end up stopping less than half way into the trailer, because I [i]had[/i] to own this. \\n\\nI just finally completed the game for my first time and on Hard (theres also an unlockable Very Hard) and it was a solid 10 hours (for me) with at least 80% of the map explored and I\\'m hoping a good amount of the items but sadly maybe only 50% of secrets (eg: Hidden walls, rooms, collectibles/sidequests) My first steam review and it goes to this game...\\n\\nIf you like platformers, pick it up. If you like adventure games, pick it up. I like many started with this installment, and have not played any of the previous games, but did not find myself confused by the story or atmosphere. You\\'re a girl with a maple leaf, and it\\'s awesome. My first hour of the game was absolutely terrible. I played it like a bullet hell platformer. This game, like many have said already, is very much like darksouls. You must plan how you gow through a screen, and more times than not attack spamming will only get you killed, ESPECIALLY on bosses. The learning is brutal, but totally worth it. A fantastic game that isn\\'t afraid to provide a challenge. Bought this game because it was cute looking. I was not prepared at all for how beautiful it looks and sounds.  Never played (or even heard of) any of the other Momodora games. But after beating this I immediately bought the third game, and got the first 2. Even bought the OST. So glad I found this game and this series! This game is criminally underappreciated. Never heard about it, saw it in my discovery queue and bought it on a whim, and I\\'m very glad I did.\\n\\nThe Good: \\n-It\\'s absolutely gorgeous. It felt like every new area I entered I had to stop and take in the scenery. probably one of the most beautiful games I have played, especially pixel art games.\\n-The animations are very clean and smooth.\\n-The bosses, enemies, and characters all have very interesting designs.\\n-The music, though it\\'s not extraordinary compared to some, it\\'s still quite good and certainly adds to the experience.\\n-The controls are very tight (once you get used to them)\\n-It\\'s quite a challenge, and it\\'s very fun to play.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n-It\\'s short (I beat it in 6 and a half hours or so casually, but trying to do everything I could find) Which is not inherently a bad thing, but this game really leaves you feeling like you want to play more of it.\\n-healing is a little tedious, it seems like every enemy attack deals more damage then one health item recovers.\\n-The difficulty curve is a little strange, to me it seems like the first area is by far the hardest area, or at least has the most awkward enemies to fight.\\n-while most secrets have some kind of clue to where they are (the map, usually) the bug collectibles seem to be hidden in almost evil locations, you pretty much have to attack or jump at every wall as both characters to find them.\\n-Not being able to navigate the menus with the mouse or things like the enter button is really confusing to get used to. Momodora RUtM has single handledly been one of the best purhcases I have made on Steam, part of me is even ashamed I couldn\\'t give the developer the full price as I had gotten it while on sale. From the beautiful sprite work, great soundtrack, solid mechanics and well presented story, Momodora RUtM has everything you should look for in a 2-D platforming adventure game. Please do not allow the very few negative reviews on this game discourage you from picking this up. Very cute little game! Definitely worth the price tag.\\nIt\\'s a metroidvania, lots of places to explores, power-ups etc...\\nLenght to complete is about 6 hours, difficulty has some serious spikes here and there.\\nAtmosphere is excellent and the stellar soundtrack really gives this a nice, emotional experience.\\n\\nGreat buy for me.\\n Metroidvania + Dark Souls atmosphere = this game\\nSoundtrack is awesome, gameplay is simple but satisfy, you have only one melee attack, bow, items and rolls, but remember it\\'s all about master dodge rolls.\\nGame is short but with that you\\'ll don\\'t feel bored, game don\\'t have unnecessary extensions which they have only keep you playing longer like many games.\\n\\nTL:DR\\nShort but gold :3 This is so cool I love it I also love how the difficulty system is between difficultys is a really good way to do it. It has goog game design thats easy to figure out wile also not holding the players hand. The first boss killed me twice but once i found a stradigy that worked it was really fun. all around from wat I\\'ve seen its really good. oh and the item system is awesome to its very salt and sancturyesk and thats not a bad thing at all but anyways i totally recomend this to people who like Souls games and side scrolers its really good.\\n\\nP.S. pardon my spelling it\\'s not my strong suit and I couldn\\'t be botherd to spell check it. Great game.  My only real wish is that it was longer.  \\n\\nOne of the best Metroidvania games I have ever played.  Great artstyle, very fun combat, and intriguing enemies and bosses.  Major fights are well spaced out and bosses are always rewarding to beat.  It tends to borrow a bit from the concept of Dark Souls in terms of several aspects, but puts it\\'s own spin on it creating a very fun, if not, punishing game especially if you play on the harder difficulties.  There is a good chance that you will enjoy the game if you are a fan of the Souls Series, 2D platformers, or Metroidvania style of games.  If you aren\\'t then I\\'d still recommend you to pick up the game if you are looking for a game that will leave you asking for more.\\n\\nDefinitely worth the $10 price tag.  Give it a chance, and I can assure that it won\\'t let you down. Super fun game, kind of short, but has tons of side quests and collectables. As a lot of people have said, this could be compared to a 2D Dark Souls. Same dark atmosphere, non-explicit story, high difficulty, etc. \\nComparing this to the previous game (Momodora III), this is a huge step forward. Amazing soundtrack that fits with the dreary feeling of the game, better combat, more items, more story, and overall improved mechanics. There are several hidden rooms and even some secret ones, so there is some level of replayability. Overall, I\\'d say it\\'s worth it even at full price. I can\\'t wait to see what the creators of this make next! About three and a half hours into [i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i], I faced what may well be the best boss battle I\\'ve encountered in any game. It came at the midpoint of a period of wide-open exploration where I could\\'ve fought any one of four bosses, all of them interesting. That battle was extremely difficult, but never unfair, and when, after more deaths than I care to admit, I realized the mistake in spacing that had kept me from winning and corrected it, I had to give serious thought to whether this was the best game I\\'d ever played.\\n\\nTwo hours later, it was over.\\n\\nI\\'d beaten the final boss (still fun, but nowhere near as exciting as that midpoint one), gotten the true ending and been dumped into new game plus with not much else to do. This prequel is the longest Momodora game, but its predecessors were exceptionally short.\\n\\nHow important is the length of the game? For a Metroidvania title like this, a short playtime means not just less to enjoy, but less to explore. That glorious feeling of being able to go anywhere and face anything in whatever order I wanted ended all too soon.\\n\\nI unreservedly recommend [i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i]. It’s at turns beautiful, adorable, and unsettling, the controls are among the best I\\'ve ever played with, the level design is great, the boss design is better, and there\\'s a stretch toward the middle of the game where it approaches legendary status. There\\'s just ultimately not enough of it for it to stay there. A great 2D platformer that reminds me a little of the Souls games. The atmosphere feels great and it doesn\\'t really waste your time with any filler areas.\\n\\nIt just feels really nice to play. This is a real good Casltvania SotN-style game. It took me just under 6 hours to beat on Normal. Well worth the $10 price.\\n\\nMy only real gripes are that I dislike the instant death spike pits. Id much prefer if they took off a large amount of health. I think every bell should be able to be warped to and that the warping should be done on the map, where you can see the actual location you\\'re going to. Those are the only flaws I can think of and they are reall just totally personal. The game controls great, the musics pretty good and the animations and art are beautiful. This is probably the best Souls-like 2D platformer I have played, personally. Though, the similarities are a bit minor. Its clearly more of a Symphony of the Night-inspired game than a Souls-inspired game. The bosses are all pretty fun and unique. The subtle story is a nice touch, too. I wonder why not many people seem to talk about this game? Total reccomendation to anyone that wats a simpler Symphony of the Night.. Something something Dark Souls.\\n\\nOkay, with that comparison out of the way, my actual opinion. Bought this on a whim at 20% off. Totally worth it. The controls are tight, and responsive. Playing on hard mode (which I did on my first playthough) was the perfect level of difficulty. When I died (which was a lot) it never felt cheap. It was always a failure of my own, and not of game design.  The boss battles were memorable and the standard enemies seldom feel like an annoyance. \\n\\nMomodora\\'s pixel artstyle can turn a lot of people away. Admittedly, a lot of the NPCs and some enemies do seem rather minimalistic to the point where they are perhaps a little too blocky, but the work on the background and bosses is way above par. The game\\'s soundtrack is also equal parts melancholic and dramatic. You might find yourself humming those gentle piano pieces for a long while after you turn the game off.\\n\\nIt\\'s a good game. Get it. The game\\'s art style is beautiful, the difficulty ranges from \"Casual\" to \"Dark Souls+\" and the world and its lore is almost as mysterious as Dark Souls\\' or any other older game.\\n\\nThe game gave me the same vibe I had when I first played Super Metroid (in \\'94) and the only two things it falls short of in comparison is playthrough time and inventory upgrades. With roughly 4 (long and fun) hours of gameplay for a single playthrough (not considering NG+, any other difficulty, and completionism) it averages around half of Super Metroid (not bad, but it could be a bit longer for my taste) and I think we can all agree that Metroid is a monster when it comes to inventory upgrades.\\n\\nThe game\\'s pacing is spot-on most of the time, it doesn\\'t hold your hand and the lore is something you will have to find out yourself, if you want to (although it obscures even more than Dark Souls did).\\n\\nAll in all, if you enjoyed Super Metroid or Dark Souls this game is a must-buy for your enjoyment.\\n\\nP.S.: I didn\\'t even find any bugs! Really fun and short Metroidvania style game. Clocked about 4 hours with 100% map completion. It was just long enough to hold my interest and not drag on like some games of this type tend to do with heavy backtracking. I would definitely recommend this game to any people who are a fan of this subgenre. I like this game a lot.\\n\\nIt has some of the best spritework I\\'ve ever seen, a gorgeous soundtrack, and gameplay that is tight and responsive. All aspects of the gameplay experience mesh together wonderfully and nothing really feels like it is missing. It is no exaggeration to say that this is now one of my favorite games of all time and it is a title I will keep returning to.\\n\\n(Yes I did originally get the game for free, but I also bought it on playism afterwards to show my support.)\\n\\n As everyone else has said this game is an amazing metrovania game.\\nlove the sprite work, gameplay and music. the replay value is good as well and adds some more challenge to the game the only problem with this game is that it is short it took me about 2 hour my first playthrough but i hear that you can complete it within an hour if your good but still and amazing game that I won’t stop playing anytime soon. \\n Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a magnificent game, I have not played the others Momodora yet but I am gonna fix this mistake soon. \\n\\n[b] First the gameplay : [/b] Momodora is a metroidvania, and a very good one. The combat mechanics are really enjoyable, I really felt that I can control the character as I want, that fell dumb when I say it but, I mean, some games doesn\\'t have controls as responsive as Momodora. About the difficulty, I have played at \"normal\" difficulty and the first hour was very surprising, it was difficult, it looks cute but you die very oftenly, but once you got it, it\\'s really enjoyable and chalenging. So I think replay it at \"hard\" would be a good experience. As I heard, there is also an \"insane\" difficulty, like a 2D dark soul, where you have to dodge or die. [spoiler] And you can play as a cat ! As a cat, even if you don\\'t have bow, you move faster and you have a smaller hitbox.\\t[/spoiler] \\n\\n[b] Art : [/b] Really charming. The background, the design, the animation.... Everything looks gorgeous. \\n\\n[b] Musics and sounds : [/b] As charming as the art and it really fit into the art and it help to create a wonderful ambiance.\\n\\n[b] Story : [/b] The whole thing is like a fairy tale, it\\'s exatly like the title says : a reverie, a daydream.... It\\'s simple but charming (yeah I don\\'t have a big vocabulary).\\n\\n[b] Summary : [/b] \\n\\nPros :\\n- Good gameplay and balanced difficulty\\n- Wonderful art and musics\\n- Charming (and I say it again and again) world, I really liked that little journey\\n- Support the french language, really surprising, I was used to play indi games in english.\\n[spoiler]- you can play as a cat ! [/spoiler]\\n\\nCons :\\n- Can\\'t remap the controller\\'s controls, but since the basic ones are good it\\'s not a big deal\\n- Maybe a little short, (it took me 6 hours to finish the game in normal with most of the secrets discovered) but not a big deal because I think replay can be fun (maybe with a higher difficulty)\\n\\n95/100 buy it with the ost and everything, it\\'s more than worth the price and it would be a steal if you have a discount. Beautiful sprites / animations. Neat controls, not perfect but pretty good. Overall enjoyable for anyone who likes platformers. A bit short, but it can be fairly challenging on the higher difficulty settings. Beautiful sprite work and enviroment art. All around a great experience. Really good game. 97/100\\n\\nMomodora 2 is available free to download, and Momodora 3 is also available via steam, both are much shorter experiences than Reverie under the moonlight, but it was fun to see how the dev has taken the series with each iteration of the game. \\n\\nReverie by itself, is a fantastic experience. This game is making me seriously consider going on a darkish-metroidvania binge for a while.\\n\\nGame is atmospheric yo. The game took me by surprise and it ended up being so fucking satisfying. The learning curve is just right and it got me hooked. I think what makes it so good in terms of gameplay is the extremely fluid and tight controls.\\n\\nWhen it comes to level design, it\\'s your metroidvania-style world. Everything neatly interconnected and rewards the player for exploring. The game as a very high replay value. \\n\\nThe story is minimal but it keeps you aware of what’s happening and character design is nice.\\n\\nThe music and sounds do a great job blending with the environments and it\\'s immersive (muh immersion) \\n\\nThe game’s length is well worth its price. If you love platformers or metroidvania style games, 100% go for it. I hope more games come from these guys. This was a random buy for me and ended up being of the best games i\\'ve gotten off of steam!  This game is beautiful, Plays great and, the soundtrack is ridiculously good!  This game deserves a lot more attention than what it gets!  10/10 I would reccomend this to anyone! I just beat this game today and I have to say that I extremely enjoyed playing through this game. If you are a fan of Metroid then you will love this game. This game has some very good music with some very good music and the areas are very bright and colorful.\\n\\nI did get lost a few times but with the help of the map I was able to navigate my way to get to other areas no problem. This is a 10/10 and should be added to anyone\\'s game library. Basically you can be a cat with dark souls like difficulty swinging a leaf around.\\nAnd that is all you need to know really.\\n\\n10/10 would cat leaf swing again Okay, I have no idea about any of the previous 3 Momodora games, so I only have this to rate.\\n\\nThe simple verdict is that what we have here is pretty decent, but the length is rather... short. 5 hours for 10 EUR, might be worth it for some I guess, I\\'d consider waiting for a steeper sale, like -40% or more.\\n\\n--- Pros:\\n+ I like the piano/strings driven soundtrack, it\\'s pretty\\n+ combat against melee-driven bosses is interesting, you have to utilize dodging well (air dashing is cool! feels like megaman X with invincibility frame)\\n+ metroidvania\\n+ overall I enjoyed it\\n\\n--- Cons:\\n- I finished it in pretty much 5 hours including lots of deaths (and as a result re-tracking), and if i had followed a guide I would have had all the ivory bugs and stuff too. Essentially, there isn\\'t as much content as I would have hoped for the price. Of course, maybe I just shouldn\\'t want to compare it to Metroid Fusion in my head?\\nStill, you only get 4+1 extra powers, out of which one of them is just the ability to warp between statues. So it\\'s more like 4 if anything.\\n- platforming is sometimes frustrating because of insta-kill spikes in the dark room so you kinda think you can fall down and you\\'ll end up in another room, but NOPE it\\'s spikes or NOPE it\\'s insta death in THIS water but not that one.\\nThen \"Retry\" puts you back to the previous save point, so if you mess something up, you have to do it all over again.\\nAnd the enemies do a LOT of damage, about 2-3 hits and you\\'re dead. Feels like playing Wings of Vi or something sometimes (and I played on Normal).\\n- the requirement for the true ending is rather.. obscure.\\n\\nAnyways, it was fun, but I wish it had been longer, like Metroid Fusion or Cave Story. This was much shorter than those; kinda like a successful Rogue Legacy run, just with a slight bit more looking around for which way you have to go.\\n\\nOh, and if you hate dying a lot, you might want to pass on this because the insta-kill spikes and the high-hitting enemies would get on your nerves. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a good metroidvania game with a few flaws.\\n\\nA TL;DR of my personal opinion and some Pros./Cons. are further below.\\n\\nHere are some thoughts, that I have about the game:\\nIt has a basis combatsystem with one normal melee combo, an aerial attack, a ranged attack with unlimited ammo, a dodge roll and some active and passive items which can be found/bought while you pogress futher.\\nThe fighting in this game fells simliar to castlevania symphony of the night with its mix of melee, ranged and spell attacks. It gets quite challenging, if you deal with multiple enemies and environmental hazard at the same time.\\nThe enemies are good but could have need a bit more variation. Most of them feel like a stronger re-skin of an already existing one. But the boss fights are overall well made and fun to beat.\\n\\nThe difficulty in this game was the first that thing, that suprised me.\\nThe first mobs (even on normal) will hit you hard and kill you easily if you don\\'t learn their pattern quick.\\nIf your are new to 2D plattformer with combat elements you might have a tough time in beginning.\\nLater parts of the game will feel easier, due to the upgrades you will find.\\n\\nThe second more pleasant suprise was the fantastic soundtrack.\\nSome of the tracks are on the same level as with OST\\'s from the metroid games IMO.\\nThe 16 ingame songs alone, add alot of value to the game. \\n\\nAnother very positive thing is the visual presantation of the game.\\nThe Gorgeous backgounds, sweet pixel arts, and visual effects and pretty good animations were nice to see,\\nNot much to complain about, besides a small lack of more outstanding rooms.\\nSome parts of the map feel a little empty and like an unnecessary dead end.\\n\\nThe story in this game on the other hand is kinda standard. \\nYou the heroine from a little village, seek a powerful queen in order to stop the evil that is spreading in the world. Some NPC\\'s will give you futher infos about what happend and a few of them even got some nice little questlines that you can follow. Unfortunately the game leaves you with quite alot of unanswered questions after the ending. The ending itself feels really unsatisfying, if I compare it with other simliar games, like Guacamelee, Cave Story+, Valdis Story: Abyssal City. There are two endings but a longer, more fleshed out epilogue would have helped and I think the NPC\\'s you meet should have had more direkt impact on the ending.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nPros:\\n+ beautiful soundtrack\\n+ nice artstyle\\n+ cool areas\\n+ good combat\\n+ nice bossfights\\n+ challenging mutiple dificulties\\n+ a few NPC\\'s with interresting short questlines\\n+ New Game Plus Mode with slight changes\\n\\nCons:\\n- only a few enemy types\\n- no in depth story, charackter development and lore\\n- underwhelming endings\\n- not enough fleshed out rooms\\n- no significant changes to the metroidvania formular\\n\\nFans of Momodora series will without a doubt like it and metroidvania veterans should give it a try, if they are looking for a good approximately 5 hour long title inbetween bigger releases of the genre. One of the most amazing metroidvania games on the market (aside from, well, Metroid and Castlevania games).\\nGame also took some bright ideas from Souls franchise in terms of mechanics and difficulty. But, unlike Souls this game is bug-free and doesn\\'t punish you for its shortcomings. You\\'re a [i]girl[/i] now, you\\'re a [i]cat[/i] now, you\\'re a girl, you\\'re a cat, you\\'re a girl, you\\'re a cat... Good Game A look into an old gaming style i loved back in the days of castlevania. This type of game i will always love. A bit conky very rarely but nonetheless didnt take away from gameplay. Simple story and design. A nice break if youre looking for a side game to dedicate a few days to. Accidentally beat it in one sitting, feelsbadman. Who woulda guessed MetroidSouls would be so fun? 10/10 An enjoyable experience. This game caught me by surprise. It has a satisfying difficulty curve that makes playing on the higher difficulties not only enjoyable, but preferable. The visuals are great, and the atmosphere is pleasantly eerie. The music fits well with that atmosphere, giving the game an ominous feel. \\n\\nThis game is however, incredibly short. It\\'ll take a few hours to clear with 100% completion on a casual playthrough, probably closer to an hour for a second or third playthrough. Yet that doesn\\'t hurt the game at all. In fact, this encourages mutliple playthroughs on the higher difficulties and even deathless or pacifist runs. \\n\\nAll in all, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a fun little package that delivers on everything it sets out to do, and I think that it deserves your attention because of this. It was my first entry in this series, and I find myself eagerly awaiting the next. Expected a kawaii ass game. Got a side scrolling dark souls.\\n\\n10/10\\nwould buy something without doing research again. Probably one of my favorite games in a long time. It\\'s inspiration is as much Castlevania as the inspiration for Freedom Planet is Sonic the Hedgehog. It takes a lot of elements from Castlevania, but also does a lot of things better.\\n\\n[list]Pros:\\n[*] Movement and Jumping is the smoothest in a platformer I\\'ve played in a long time.\\n[*] Combat has a nice visceral feel to it.\\n[*] The soundtrack is AWESOME! If you can buy it with the game, definetly do it.\\n[*] While there aren\\'t too many, the powerups are pretty much all useful.\\n[*] Unlike most Castlevania games, there is no grinding. You can increase your strength, but no level system.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[list]Cons:\\n[*] Comparably short (beat it in approximately 4 hours)\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd really thats all. The game is short, but luckily Momodora 1-2 are free and you can get Momodora 3 for pretty cheap. I recommend supporting this developer, I\\'d like to see a Momodora 5 someday. I loved every moment of this game and echo many people’s words. Challenging, but not frustrating, and undeniably fun. Could be compared to a 2d dark souls meets metroid, but very much has its own place.\\n\\nTo someone who wants to see more in a game than \\'just gameplay\\'... I could write three times this on every aspect of this game such as the beautiful pixel art graphics, the clear variation in zones, the NPC\\'s and hidden story development that makes you want to find out how not only where your story leads you, but theirs too. The ambient and ‘intense moment’ music fits so perfectly in every scenario and is almost always there - but absent in just the right places where silence draws more thought provoking emotion than music would.\\n\\nTrying to avoid any spoilers, but I really hope this is not the last instalment of this. It was a very bittersweet rollercoaster of emotions.\\nPocket Incense is OP :D Underrated game.\\n\\nHonestly, you don\\'t even need to read the reviews, just looking at the trailer, you can tell its going to be challenging and fun. Momodora IV is a charming metroid-vania with beautiful pixel art and an awesome soundtrack that wears its Dark Souls inspiration on its sleeve. I thoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough, and, being new to the series, await a potential follow up. \\n\\nI can\\'t emphasise enough how gorgeous this game is. An excellent game!\\nQuality pixel art graphics, fitting music, tight and precise controls.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a metroidvania-style game with dreary atmosphere where you take control of a priestess on a quest to help her home village that has fallen victim of a curse. The priestess is using indestructable maple leaf to beat down her enemies, which is an iteresting choise of a weaponry, i must say. She also is quite a skilled marksman with her bow, shooting volleys of arrows or rapid-firing to deal alot of damage to her foes.\\nThe gameplay consists of traversing through different locations, fighting enemies, exploring every nook and cranny for secrets and fighting area bosses. If you die, you start from a checkpoint - holy bells you encounter and use to save your progress and, later, warp between areas of the game.\\nI really don\\'t want to use the beaten-up terms, but this game is quite literally a \"darksouls 2d\".\\n\\nI enjoyed my playthrough of Momodora alot and most definitelly would recommend this game to anyone who likes being challenged by their games. Hard difficulty level really is HARD. Personally, I\\'ve beaten the first boss on Hard and decided that playing the rest of the game on Normal would be sufficient for me :D\\n\\nThe only major downside of this game is it\\'s length. It\\'s quite short - I\\'ve beaten it in 6 hours. Fair enough it has a new game plus and I haven\\'t found 100% of secrets (but did get a true ending)... Still I felt like it ended pretty fast. Although, that\\'s better than overstaying your welcome, I suppose. this bring back memories its a metroidvania type game where you go search and find stuff while you are fighting bosses/monsters its been a long time since i find a game like this it has great story hope we see another game of the series Great little game. Well worth your time (about 8h) and money. Just finished. I enjoyed it. The fighting was simple but effective. I felt the Dark Souls/ Castlevania influence in it. \\nDecent story. Nothing crazy but simple and effective. Towards the end you\\'re asked a yes or no question that made me have to put down the controller but other than that, nothing stood too far out, for me at least.\\nVery good mechanics. You could feel each impact. Hitstop is something I need to take notes on.  \\nMusic. Very well done. Each piece matched the environment. I\\'d try it out if you can. It\\'s a good 6-8 hour game. Beautiful art, excellent atmosphere, super gratifying gameplay. Imagine a close-ranged mix between Cave Story and Super Metroid and you have Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight.\\n\\nThis game is:\\nExtremely light on backtracking \\nLightly story-based\\nOcassionally punishing, not hard though.\\nFairly short (~4 hours)\\n\\nSome may say the price is high for the amount of time the game lasts, but I honestly feel like it\\'s one of the better purchases I\\'ve made this year. I was never a big fan of the old Momodora games, but I\\'m definitely going back to give them another shot now. Awesome game. The visuals and animation make the gameplay make everything feel good. It runs smoothly, boss design is awesome, music is awesome, fairly challeging but not broken hard. Very good game. It\\'s a good mix of a Metroidvania with some Dark Souls mechanics. Very nice game! It can be both challenging for those hardcore players and casual players, which is a nice bonus. Absoultely love the art style and the animations are so smooth. Theres a fair amount of \"secrets\" that will probably keep me coming back for a couple more playthroughs, especially since I got the bad ending the first time around. Although I was pretty confused with the story, if it even counts as a story, that didn\\'t really detract from my enjoyment. The story is very subtle and you\\'ll probably need to research or play the previous games to figure it out, but its not necessary. Gameplay is simple and easy to pick up, although you\\'ll need to learn some more \"advanced\" techniques in order to be truly stellar at the game. \\n\\nOverall its a great game thats worth every penny, especially during sales. A fascinating metroidvania indie title with a lovely soundtrack. A short and sweet game that directs focus towards gameplay and aesthetics. Taking some inspiration from the Dark Souls universe, you can expect a fair amount of challenge early on if you\\'re new to the genre. This game is easily completeable within a day as it lacks an expansive world and any sort of quest system - making it perfect for those who prefer a streamlined experience free of distractions. If you\\'re interested in the design approach and pixel art, I highly recommend purchasing this title. If you\\'re a fan of Cavestory, then you probably wan\\'t to play this.\\n\\nAlso try Momodora I to III Great game beat the shit out of monsters with a leaf what els can you ask for. Solid metroidvania style game, with a little hint of a Souls game. I wish this game gets all the attention it needs because it is truly a hidden gem.\\n\\nOnly large complaint against it is the really short lenght (if you play it only once). 9/10 A very solid metroidvania game with dark soulsesque features, such as unforgiving enemies and estus flask like items. The difficulty is a little steep at the beginning, but the game is more than worth it. Super short and mostly boring. Looks nice though. (Note: Reverie is my first experience with the series, I did not play any of the previous installments.)\\n\\nMomodora RutM is a side-scrolling platformer \"metroidvania\" game, taking some elements from the Souls series of games. The player controls the Lun priestess Kaho in her quest to end the curse that is plaguing her homeland. \\n\\nBy far the most striking aspects of the game are its gorgeously designed areas, well animated characters and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack; but should you want a brutally challenging gameplay experience Hard mode is unlocked from the start. \\nThe combat is easy to pick up but the game constantly tests your ability with ambushes and tricky enemies. If Kaho\\'s maple leaf and bow are not enough to handle every monster in the city, she can also equip usable and passive items that can cast spells or change her attributes on the fly. Her dodge roll grants great invulnerability and should allow getting past all attacks unscathed (I hear this is a requirement in Lunatic difficulty), but should you take a hit you have your estus flas- I mean, bellflowers to heal you. Boss fights vary in difficulty and memorability, but most are fun and challenging. \\n\\nLike the Souls series, the story isn\\'t handed to you through cutscenes but rather (often optional) dialogue with various mysterious characters and the descriptions of items you pick up. However, this is a short game with less items and characters and chances to encounter those characters than a Souls game, and as a result the story ends up being simpler and shorter. Descriptions do give the setting some depth but some feel irrelevant and unconnected where they could have been tied into elements of the world. I feel that perhaps this style of story telling doesn\\'t fit a shorter game like RutM too well, however it does wonders for the dark, depressing mood carried by the game.\\n\\nThe fourth installment of Momodora is a hidden indie gem. It\\'s hard for me to find flaws within it - while it could have been bigger, for its size it is a really well polished and enjoyable metroidvania with gorgeous art and a great soundtrack. Not the best game I\\'ve EVER played, but it definitely challenges the other games I\\'ve played this year for the top spot. To give you some perspective on that, that would include Transistor, Enter the Gungeon, CRYPTARK, Catacomb Kids, Teleglitch, Axiom Verge, CrossCode, the Plague Knight expansion for Shovel Knight, and The Count Lucanor, to name just a few that this game contends with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI, uhhh......I really like games. >_>;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d really like to do a full video review of this game, since that would be a lot less rambly than the towering pillars of text I tend to type, but for now I\\'d just like to give a quick summary (you know, a paragraph-and-a-half in):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis game FAR succeeds its predecessors. The last three were alright - and yes, I\\'ve played and beaten all three - but that doesn\\'t mean the game didn\\'t leave me disappointed in a couple places. The music and visuals were jaw-dropping, but the story was.....mmmmmmmmmmeh. Of course, the story only refers to the overarcing main plot and objective of the game, which has always been lacking in the Momodora franchise. And mind you, Momodora\\'s focus was never the storyline.\\n\\nNo, Momodora speaks in ATMOSPHERE. It envelops you in the world - speaking in small pieces of lore that, while they may not fully explain all of the backstory, still make the world around you feel much bigger than it is. And this game is the current apex of that.\\n\\n\\nCombat is more fluid and engaging than ever before. People have used the term \" \\'Souls-like\" to describe games of a similar genre before, but never have I genuinely felt that I was playing Bloodborne as a platformer before this game and I LOVE it. (No, not Dark Souls. BLOODBORNE. Definitely Bloodborne.)\\n\\nIf I could give one complaint, htough, I\\'ve noticed how far the game has strayed from it\\'s original vision. The original one carried a much more clear inspiration from the likes of Cave Story, whereas such inspiration is barely visible here.\\n\\nNow, that isn\\'t a bad thing in itself, but I realized something towards the end of the game.\\n\\n\\n\"How often had I used anything other than rolling to avoid attacks?\"\\n\\n\\nTruly, the game doesn\\'t ask for much more of you than that in the combat. Even during the bosses, I rarely find myself feeling any compulsion to jump or duck (save for Purple McBirdFace), and that realization did leave something of a bitter taste in my mouth. It felt like you didn\\'t really demand the player to make full use of every tool in their arsenal, even at the point where they had all their abilities!\\n\\nOf course, the fact it took so long for me to realize this is in itself also a testament to how well-designed this game is. Even with this knowledge, I\\'ve enjoyed the game no less than before, and am currently on my way to beating the last two bosses on Insane mode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAAAAAAAAAAND THIS IS LIKE SIX PARAGRAPHS.\\n\\nSHIT.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, great game. Paid more for Kero Blaster, but I woulda\\' paid even more for this. This game is hard. Hard but fair. Also there is controller support and some cute dialogue, artwork, and fitting music. Easily worth dying, over and over, and over... and over.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard. This game is fantastic and deserves way more attention than it seems to be getting.\\n\\nFor context, I bought this game on a whim, with no prior experience with the series, as a recommendation in my Steam discovery queue.  I\\'m a pretty active \"variety\" player and try to keep up with new releases on Steam, so I was surprised both that I hadn\\'t heard about it before, nor heard any community chatter elsewhere.\\n\\nIt\\'s a Metroidvania style platformer with strong, responsive controls, and enjoyable combat mechanics. My first hour or so was somewhat punishing -- it\\'s an unexpectedly challenging game, but things really clicked for me after about 30-45 minutes, and I started enjoying myself quite a lot. I did my first playthrough in one sitting, in about 4.5 hours, and realized there are multiple endings, and things I missed, so I do plan to go back for another playthrough sometime soon. I\\'m not usually huge on replaying games (there are a lot of games, and I like to play a wide variety), but I had such a good time with Momodora, and there\\'s enough here that compels me to see it through a second time.  \\n\\nOne of my favorite games so far this year. :) on of the best and reponsive platformers out there, i can\\'t recommend it enough! im just a little sad that it is kinda short. if the developers makes a new game, please keep the gamemechanics, its one of the best controlls i have ever played! i can\\'t wait for a sequal or some dlc stories Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a solid platformer, with a focus on melee combat using a leaf, of all things.\\n\\nYou\\'ll notice it\\'s tagged as a metroidvania. Much like Cave Story, I don\\'t really agree with this. Yes, it has a map that looks like the one in Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night, but if you come here expecting something along those lines you might be let down. \\n\\nThis is the fourth title in this series, and it\\'s really improved with this entry. The art is much better, and the gameplay itself feels more polished. If you played the earlier games and didn\\'t quite like them, this might be worth giving a shot anyway.\\n\\nAs I said, the main focus for combat is melee. You have a ranged attack, and it certainly comes in handy, but you will probably want to be right in bosses faces, slashing away with your leaf. You\\'ve got a dodge roll also, and you will want to get real familiar with that ability quickly. Getting hit can really hurt, especially when you are fighting a boss. I wouldn\\'t go as far as to call this game difficult, but if you aren\\'t using the dodge roll, you are probably going to be dying a lot.\\n\\nThere are various items, both passive and active use, that you will find as you play. You can have two passive items equipped, and three active items. The active items refill at save points, so don\\'t think you need to save them for later. Finding more of an item you already have will add to the total for that item.\\n\\nYou\\'ll also get a couple new abilities as you go, but these aren\\'t anything on the level of Super Metroid. I think you find two abilities that allow access to new areas, and it\\'s always something like a tiny little side path with some item at the end. You aren\\'t going to be coming across any dead ends as you go that you need to return to with a plethora of new abilities that enable you to explore more of the map. Much like Cave Story, the game is pretty linear over all.\\n\\nStill, it\\'s pretty damn good for what it is.\\n\\n8.5 maple leaves out of ten.\\n\\n Eh its ok Its like a side scroller Dark Souls. And yes it super difficult even in normal difficulty. Its fun I\\'d recommend it, just remember don\\'t get greedy same thing as Dark Souls. It\\'s a fun game that\\'s a bit on the short side.  As others mentioned, it\\'s similar to Dark Souls/Castlevania, with a difficulty slider, so you can find a good feel for how hard you want the game. So far the game is awesome, the best way to describe it is essentially the love child of Castlevania, Cave Story and Dark Souls. Im not super partial to the washed out Cave Story look of the sprites (probably why I didn\\'t play the previous ones) but the art design is undeniably fantastic and the dodge roll mechanic as well as the game\\'s plot, atmosphere and battles gives it a gleefully Dark Souls feel. I also like how solid the gameplay feels, it\\'s polished and doesn\\'t feel floaty or imprecise. This is definately best \\'Castlevania\\' style game I played recently.\\nThe visual is absolutely stunning, and the music is great too.\\n10/10 must buy! I see the term \"Metroidvania\" being thrown around a lot, but I\\'m not sure if that\\'s true. Momodora 4 is truly its own game, and you really need to play it to understand what I\\'m on about. It\\'s a 2D platformer unlike anything else I\\'ve ever played.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in picking this up, absolutely go for it, but only if you enjoy a good challenge. A fantastic metroidvania with great sprite-work and atmosphere, as well as seemingly Souls-inspired game mechanics and cryptic story presentation. Not very long, but this is quality over quantity. Wonderful animation, great bosses and a lovely soundtrack. If you enjoy metroidvanias then you\\'ll enjoy this one, no doubt. I don\\'t always poison myself, but when I do, it\\'s with my own arrows. Started up the game, knew it was going to be great after 30 seconds. Confirmed my impression for the next 6-7 hours. The game is essentially perfect, I really can\\'t find anything wrong with it. If you like action platformers, atmospheric games, and severe depression, buy this game now. \\n\\nThis is one of the only games where I jumped right into NG+ upon beating it. Usually I\\'m tired of the game or just burnt out, but this game is short enough yet satisfying enough to warrant another play right away. \\n\\n10/10 \"Momodora: RUTM\" is a pixely sidescroller that combines mechanics from the Metroidvania-genre and Soulsborne-games (Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Bloodborne). The story is simple but the map and gameplay offer enough depth to make up for that. Exploration gets rewarded with upgrades of your basic abilities and new spells. Bosses range from trivial to challenging though more difficult game-modes are either available from the start or get subsequently unlocked.\\n\\nJust like in games like Dark Souls you unlock checkpoints to save your game, refill your healing items, health and cure status effects. Unlike the formerly mentioned similarities however, enemies do respawn when just re-visiting screens or locations and don\\'t stay down until you find a safe haven. This is very much referring to classic sidescrollers, which this game is alluding to visually and mechanically.\\n\\nAll in all I spent around 4-5 hours to get to the end but could have easily kept playing for another hour to find all of the hidden (and optional) collectibles. Encounters with NPCs, that seem to be able to be handled in different ways, make me eager to get into the \"New Game Plus\".\\n\\nThis is definitely a hidden gem. I got this game on a sale but would recommend it on the full price as well, \"Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\" is more than worth both your time and money. yes Take time-honored metroidvania, mix in essence of Dark Souls, add a dash of Touhou, and make sure the animation is smooth as butter and the sound design is better than Cave Story, and you have a recipe for the best game I\\'ve played in quite some time. This game is fantastic and everyone should play it. This game is really fun, albeit abit short. For the current price, I think it\\'s worth it. The game flows well and has a very solid difficulty level. I\\'ve only played on normal and have died quite a few times so hard should be really interesting. If you like metroidvania games (especially cave story) this is for you!\\n Level 1: A nice breezy forest with cute little imps and a fun giant catepillar boss.\\n\\nLevel 2: 2D BLOODBORNE\\n\\nWow, this game really escalates. Momodora is an enjoyable metroidvania that can be pretty easily completed in ~5 hours. I don\\'t think you need to play the other Momodora games, but it was pretty odd when I turned into a cat and no one was surprised by it. Maybe one of the other games would explain that bit a little more, but eh whatever.\\n\\nAlso one of the bosses is a giant lady with big boobs. Her weak point is her boobs. Smackin\\' tatas is pretty cool. Bought this game on a whim during the anime games sale and ended up loving it beyond belief, Its a staggeringly beautiful and well made game on par with symphony of the night or Hyper Light Drifter but with the added tragety that literally nobody is playing this and the Devs aren\\'t getting the recognition they deserve for a game like this.\\n\\nIf you like Metroidvania, buy this game.\\n\\nif you like dark souls or hyper light drifter, buy this game.\\n\\nPerhaps my biggest issue with it is that there isn\\'t enough game  to enjoy, I wish it went on longer, and when that is the biggest of your problems your game has, you\\'re in a good position already. Hotline Karst 2: Wrong Leaf This has been, without a doubt, the best purchase I\\'ve ever made on Steam. \\n\\nIt\\'s a wonderful journey with touching characters and an unspoken story. The combat is simple at first, but the further you go, the more thought you\\'ll be putting into every attack, making split decisions against the smallest of phantoms to the largest of bosses. The soundtrack creates a vibe of wonder and sadness. \\n\\n10/10 Fantastic\\n\\n[spoiler]Would cat again[/spoiler] Fantastic game, a little short but that prevents it from feeling padded.  One of the best metroidvania games I\\'ve played in ages. It\\'s a really great platformer with some fun pixel art! Get it! Momodora. Oh Momodora.\\n\\nI played a bit of the first two and beat Momodora III, and i must say, the new ones get better and better, but this was a huge gap. Compared to the rest of the series, this is, without a doubt the best entry. \\n\\nPros:\\n\\n>very very fun\\n>challenging\\n>very cute and pretty art style\\n>[spoiler] you get to play as a cat [/spoiler]\\n>very soothing music\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n>can be pretty difficult (especially some of those achievments)\\n>thats it\\n\\nEven if you havent played the others, play this anyway, its super duper good Fun and challenging metroidvania game with beautiful spritework and great music. Controls are tight and responsive. There are plenty of hidden items that provide some replay value. Definately worth the original asking price and a steal when it is on sale. But I know a review like this is not what you want to hear so let me just compare it to Dark Souls because everything is like Dark Souls. Dark Souls pioneered gaming as we know it, all hail Dark Souls. Quite possibly one of my favorite games, it\\'s kind of like a 2-d dark souls, depending on difficulty. \\n\\nIf you own a controller, recommended. Using a controller is incredibly smooth and very fun. If you have a keyboard recommended, but you might have to change the keys to something more comfortable. Personally I got used to them fairly quickly, although with a lot of confusion. \\n\\nStory is meh personally, but I\\'m not good at judging story. [spoiler] Though I hate the game for making me either mercy kill my 2nd favorite character or let him/her suffer. They gave a good item at least when I mercy killed them. [/spoiler] Solid metroidvania. Excellent game, Great platformer and interesting controls. Cant wait to play more! A pleasant discovery I did! This game is a nice little metroidvania treat. When I discovered it was part of a sequel I feared I\\'d have to play the other ones or straight spoil the story just to get what was going on, but no. The simple but effective dialogue gives you a very clear idea of what\\'s happening.\\n\\nI started on Hard difficulty, being the badass dude that I am, and made it past the cinder area. It\\'s brutal. Bosses kill you in one hit, yet the game gives you recovery items. Hard to use them if you die instantly, so I\\'d suggest you start with normal difficulty, even for the thrill seekers. I had fun however, and acknowledge that mostly it was my bad, but it\\'s insulting when you do stuff for straight 10 minutes without taking a single hit, then a random boss fight happens and BOOM YOU\\'RE DEAD BITCH! And unlike Dark Souls, you die proper and lose the time you invested.\\n\\nAs for the gameplay, well it\\'s a metroidvania. You have a bow with unlimited arrows that you can charge if you want (protip, you can charge and attack at the same time) but there\\'s also some basic combat in there. It\\'s very simple, with a 3-hit combo, a dodge roll, a air-slash, you can stunlock weak enemies and even some bosses. You also collect money which you can use for items. However, it\\'s not really a RPG. There\\'s active and passive items, but there\\'s no experience nor any ways to \\'\\'level up\\'\\'. There are permanent health upgrades and probably a few key items to boost your damage, but it\\'s not a souls clone. There ain\\'t no 20 classes of weapons, there\\'s no armor either.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is brilliant and colorful, the trailer is great and it doesn\\'t do it justice. Some enemies are also very well drawn and fit in the environment. There is an easy setting and if you\\'re simply drawn for the artstyle, it\\'s also for you. There\\'s a dark souls vibe in there of course and the story is intriguing enough. You should get it. It\\'s freaking 10 dollars and it\\'ll be good money spent. IT\\'S JUST DARK SOULS  but in 2D !\\ngenius... just GENIUS ! The Dark Souls of 2D. A really good metroidvania with heaps of atmosphere and exploration. Also it looks like you\\'re playing as a white mage from Final Fantasy and theres mapple leaves, everybody loves maple leaves. [h1]♥[/h1]\\n\\nThe best game I\\'ve played since Ori and the Blind Forest. What an amazing gift from the developers to any gamer starved for a good old SotN-style Castlevania game. It is absolutely impossible to find a better use for the £7 I\\'ve spent on this masterpiece.\\n\\nFluent controls; fantastic animation and visuals; great level design; lots of mysteries and secrets; the ATMOSPHERE, holy fook is the atmosphere powerful!\\n\\nHaving to walk back to the boss and mash through the dialogue after death broke the otherwise perfect flow of the game for me a couple of times, and that\\'s about the only (really minor) complaint I have about the whole experience.\\n\\n♥♥♥/♥ Would erase this game from my memory so I can once again play it for the first time. I bought this game thinking \"Oh hey, this game looks pretty cool, and it\\'s pretty cheap, why not buy it?\" However, I had no idea that this game would easily jump into my top ten favorite games. The game has beautiful sprites that are all animated nicely, music that perfectly fits the mood of the areas you\\'re in and the all around dark tone of the entire game. The game has a perfect balance of difficulty. It\\'s hard enough to where I never feel bored, but not hard enough to make me throw my computer out a window. All in all Momodora is an excellent Metroidvania game and I look forward to playing either the next momodora (if there even can be another one) or just the next game made by the developers. I\\'m a big fan of Momodora already -- not to mention cutesy pixel platformers in general, so there lies my bias.  If you are a neoretro platform person, every entry in the series is worth time and money (even the free ones, which should be shined up just a bit and sold on Steam, *hint hint*).  \\n\\nThere is such a gigantic leap between the third game and [i]RutM[/i] in terms of graphical polish, though, that it shocks me.  The chibis from the first three were great, but the somewhat realistically proportioned characters in IV allow for animations that are just [i]so[/i] much more expressive, and the devs took full advantage.  The sound and music are equally pro (but the audio has always been perfect, so no surprise there).  \\n\\nI imagine it would have been very tempting, considering the immense artistic talent at Bombservice\\'s disposal, to put all energies into little visual touches, leaving the mechanics clunky and the game easy to compensate for imprecision -- but they went all out, polishing the gameplay as intently as graphics and sound.  The major results of this hard work are twofold: \\n\\n1.)  Kaho, a fragile but versatile heroine that can dodge on a dime, close with a satisfyingly *thwocky* melee combo, and fire laser-fast arrows for chip damage;    \\n2.)  a handful of great bosses to throw Kaho against, emphasis on the dainty, lithe and deadly [b]Pardoner Fennel[/b], who is one of the greatest indie bosses in memory.      \\n\\nIt cannot be stressed enough how player-responsive and fair the gameplay is; they must have taken an X-acto to those hitboxes, because the [i]Dark Souls[/i]-inspired dodge-rolling works even better here than in the games it came from!    \\n\\nI played the game on hard, and it was a tough but perfectly fair challenge.  This is the setting I would recommend for people who have played this kind of game before, and if you take your time and investigate everything, you\\'ll wind up with 10+ hours of mean bosses, precise platforming and superb exploratory adventure.  I\\'ve already drawn comparisons to earlier entries, but that\\'s really quite an evolution from [i]Momodora\\'s III[/i] potential 25 minutes!\\n\\nNow, I\\'d like to give voice to two minor quibbles.  I feel somewhat sheepish about picking on such a wonderful game, but I\\'m going to anyway.  First, some of the English text is kind of funky.  \"Expurge\" is not a word (and there were a few other odd inventions I can\\'t remember).  Also, in writing the dialog, the developers should concentrate more on precision; there are many vague or incorrect word choices that do not lend themselves well to the vibe of the conversation.  Secondly (and less importantly), I really miss the character portraits from the earlier games.  Though the animations are very expressive, static portraits would add that final touch to the personalities of the NPCs.\\n\\nRecommended highly!  Buy it now!  Play the old ones!  Buy all future releases!\\n\\n(Played as part of my pre-work \"Game and Tea\" series, though there was considerable weekend spill-over.) I knew something was missing from super metroid, apparently it was a cute anime girl This is a simple game with hard challenges.\\nA perfect example of what good old school adventure side-scrolling games were about.\\nThe story is OK in my opinion but not the main reason to play this game.\\nBack tracking is only really necessary a few times but you can choose to do more to find hidden treasures.\\n\\nAll in all i give this game a 8/10. Definetly worth the price. Another really good Metroidvania on Steam! Most problems I\\'ve had with the game on release have since been fixed and even though more than a year has passed, since I originally finished my Momodora playthrough, I can still remember most of the unique bossfights and areas.\\n\\nThat\\'s how good this game actually is.\\n\\nIf you can relax to challenging gameplay, I highly recommend playing this game on hard mode. It really feels like RutM was designed to be played this way.\\n\\nMomodora features some of the most memorable bossfights I have seen in the genre, an awesome soundtrack, precise gameplay and beautiful pixel art. this game is great, i can\\'t believe more people haven\\'t played it. it\\'s a metroidvania in the vein of SOTN and dawn of sorrow, although you can\\'t equip different weapons, just a bow and a leaf. very cool pixel art style, and cool music. surprisingly the writing was pretty interesting too. check it out! You get to be a cat. \\n\\nAlso monster girls. \\n\\n10/10 This was my first game in the series. Before writing this review I have now played and beaten all the others. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite series. Buy it and play it for yourself. Really nice game I would recommend it.\\nPretty much it does feel like a 2D \"Dark Souls\" game if you play it on the hard mode.\\nyou can get about 7 hours out of it if your going for a normal ending \\nMaybe 13 hours if your going for the good ending without a where to guide.\\nIn the end pretty good game for 10$ Awesome game, it actually paid for itself, i got a foil card worth 18 euros while playing it. Wow. really just one of the best games ever made, buy it I guess i just suck ass at metroidvania games becasue i can\\'t even get past the first level\\n10/10 An anime-inspired mashup of Castlevania, Dark Souls, with a pinch of Metroid.  Wonderful soundtrack, fluid, challenging gameplay, and gorgeous animation.  Not terribly long, but a very fun ride.  Highly recommended. In my personal opinion, Momodora: Reviere Under the Moonlight is what the previous games in the series strived to be. The game started out slowly, with the first two bosses feeling like more polished Momodora 3 content. However, when I reached the third boss I fought I was astounded. Pardoner Fennel was what sold me on this game. That fight was amazing. In terms of mechanics, the game feels tight as previous games, but takes it in a more Souls-esque direction with the combat rolls and bell system. The general gameplay is much slower than previous games, but this game feels far better than any of the others. The platforming feels tight, the combat has weight to it, and the variety of equipment allowed me to take my playstyle in any direction I wanted. It holds tons of replay value, as after I played it the first time I went on to play it in both Hard and Insane. While I felt the game was too easy on normal and hard, insane provided the challenge and satisfaction of completing what the game had set before me. The bosses all drop unique equipment if you can defeat them without taking damage, something that I hope more developers take note of as I really loved this about Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight. The world map is reminiscent of Castlevania, littered with shortcuts like a 2d Dark Souls as you are allowed to go in any direction you want after a while. However, because everything is open the difficulty is stagnant for most of the game as nearly half of the game is approachable in nearly any order. My one gripe with the game is that the instant you learn the attacks of bosses they become relatively simple, even on Insane. My personal favorite boss, Archpriestess Choir, was a blast the first time I fought her on Insane, but the second time I breezed through as the only strength the bosses of this game have are that you do not know their moves the first time fighting them. If they improve the bosses\\' complexity for their next game, I don\\'t know if I\\'ll have any gripes with it at all.\\nPros:\\nGreat Soundtrack\\nDecent Replayability\\nSatisfying Combat\\nTight Platforming\\nGreat World Design\\nCons:\\nSimplistic Bosses\\nLack of increasing difficulty\\nDisappointing Final Boss\\nForgettable Characters\\n\\n\\n\\nTl:dr\\n\\nA memorable game with all the makings for a great Souls-esque Metroidvania that has hiccups in its simplistic bosses and stagnant difficulty.\\n\\n9.3/10 The best in the series. This was a really fun platformer with a decent challenge, and great artwork. I really liked the character design present here. It\\'s amazing what the developers pulled off with those small pixel sprites. The controls are extremely tight and responsive. I never felt like I was fighting the controls, and knew when I died it was my own fault, which provided a good challenge and great satisfaction when you polished off another boss. \\n\\nI highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid platformer, especially if you love the beautiful modern pixel style as much as I do. Can\\'t wait to see what else the developer comes up with! A great post-Dark Souls metroidvania with intuitive and responsive controls, solid combat mechanics, challenging and varied boss fights, and great pixel art and animation. I\\'ve played through both Momodora II (a free game available off Steam) and III and have always been a huge fan of the games\\' visual aesthetic (which has gotten progressively better with each installment), but I always believed the actual gameplay of the series was only decent. III in particular was [i]so close[/i] to being a great game, but the permanent death pitfalls which were prevalent everywhere didn\\'t mesh well with the style the game was going for: a more Metroid styled game with emphasis on combat. I still consider Momodora III to be a fine game, and would recommend playing through at least that game before this to see the recent progression in the series (especially seeing as the game is currently only $4!)\\n\\nThe reason I suggest playing III before Reverie Under the Moonlight (RUtM) is because the progression from that game to this one is [i]astounding[/i]. Visually, this game is staggering: I\\'d go as far as to say it features my favorite pixel art of any game I\\'ve ever played. The screenshots and trailer are flattering but still fail to fully express just how much of an artistic triumph the game\\'s visuals are. Despite this, the visuals aren\\'t the most noteworthy improvement in RUtM, rather, it\\'s the gameplay which finally excels beyond just \"good enough\". The game\\'s controls are responsive, simple, and intuitive; for example, the melee attack can be chained into a simple 3 hit combo which is powerful at the expense of (fair) vulnerability. Unlike prior entries in the series, RUtM features enemies which not only look nice, but actually present challenge to the player, especially in situations with small mobs. Most of my deaths in RUtM resulted from misplaying against enemies rather than the dreaded pitfalls of Momodora III, which to me was far less frustrating. As (many) others have mentioned, the game also draws a fair bit of influence from the Souls series as well. The challenging enemies, bosses, and active item system all are easily comparable to Dark Souls counterparts, for example, the HP-restoring Bellflowers in the game are basically the Momodora Estus flask, refilling whenever you reach a save point. This is a very good thing, as the challenges in RUtM require the player to actually \"git gud\" and learn enemy/boss patterns and play mindfully rather than just mindfully hack and slash away enemy hordes. Bosses have always been a strength of the Momodora series, and RUtM delivers a large handful of bosses which demand pattern recognition and are difficult, but immensely satisfying to defeat.\\n\\nI have few faults with RUtM, and almost all of them have to do with the game\\'s brevity rather than its core. I\\'m not talking about the duration of the game (took me ~6 hours to beat and there is a New Game+ which I\\'ll be playing through in the future), but rather aspects of the game which I believe could have been more thoroughly implemented. Passive equipment is present in the game, but there really aren\\'t many choices and some of the passive items are blatantly superior and eat away your very limited equip slots. Additionally, the currency in the game (munny, which functions EXTREMELY similarly to Souls in Dark Souls) is abundant but there really aren\\'t enough merchants in the game. The merchants that [i]are[/i] in the game don\\'t sell many items at all, having at most 3 items for sale. While exploration in the game is encouraged and there are several notable rewards awaiting more prying players, I really wish there were more \"hidden\" areas, especially ones which rewarded the player with weapon upgrades, good passive equipment, etc.\\n\\nIn short, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game which really is as nice (perhaps even better) than it looks and is the first installment in the series I\\'d call an excellent game. Its shortcomings simply add up to it leaving you wanting more, rather than being disappointed with the game itself. $10 is a steal for a game with this much polish! \"Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\"is definitely not a bad game, though it IS lean on content after you get all HP upgrades, bugs, and items. If the development team felt like adding anything else, I\\'d recommend a new playable character in the form of the Pardoner Fennel or the Knight character. Those two have reason to fight the queen just like main character Kaho does.\\nIn addition, of the NPCs introduced in the game\\'s 4-6 hour runtime, several do stand out as moderately developed characters in this grim kingdom of dangerous monsters. Askorn, a skeleton looking for his wife, receives some closure should you look for it while Eri, a girl who Kaho meets upon entering the Grave area, leaves more questions than are answered when you give her back her hope (Why do you have this item, Eri? Are you not telling us something about yourself?). Others who give you some guidance or world-building text and either are forgotten or become your next boss fight. I have not taken the Birthstone to every location in question with this statement, but it is unlikely that the cat-lady girl in the Monastery says much else than what I have already seen from her.\\nOne of Momodora\\'s greatest strengths is the fluidity of the sprites. Naturally larger sprites move less fluidly, but when many smaller characters/monsters or Kaho herself move, they do so in fairly graceful motion. I point in particular to the Pardoner Fennel boss fight, which is as close to a straight player-versus-player battle you will get.\\nSpeaking of the boss fights, I would consider many of them to be very good, though also very dangerous. However, every boss has a reward item you can obtain should you not take ANY damage for the duration of the battle.This one mechanic changes some or most fights from \"fair\" to \"time to kill yourself, you touched a pixel of the hitbox and took damage... for the 20th time in a row.\" In particular I now point to the Heretical Arsonist boss as well as the Lupiar half of the Lupiar-Magnolia fight. After the Arsonist fight, you obtain the air-dodge... A skill that would have made the Arsonist much easier to obtain her item early. In regards to Lupiar, on the other hand, her part of her tag-team fight becomes difficult the moment you try to no-hit the fight. The reason for this is Lupiar is immune to your (essential) arrows, forcing you to risk touch-damage on a melee-based enemy.\\nIgnoring this mechanic, bosses in \"Momodora: RUtM\" will provide you with a fair challenge, learning their attacks and dodging accordingly. You WILL die to many of them your first time, but proper mastery of ranged combat, healing, offensive items, and leaf-smacking will see you triumph.\\nSpeaking of items, I was surprised to find no items that specifically were about reducing the damage that you take, which is shockingly high. Rather, items are broken down between \"do damage,\" \"healing consumable,\" and \"utility during travel.\" During your first run, you WILL have the Ring of Candor equipped to find all the secrets as you travel, right up to any given boss fight, likewise with the Cat Sphere.\\nAs for the music... the less said about Karst City\\'s \"ambiance\" the better. Excluding that one track, the music illustrates the nature of each respective area of the world, the best probably being the Forlorn Monastery\\'s very, well, forlorn and echoing theme. Nothing I\\'d listen to when walking about, but it carries the meaning while you are playing.\\n\\nOverall: B+\\n- Get this game is you like the \"Metroidvania\" style of action adventure gameplay. Great metroidvania that\\'s much like 2D DarkSouls, with CaveStory-esque art, and extremely smooth animations.\\n\\nAnd when I say Darksouls I don\\'t mean just because it\\'s a difficult, but it actuially uses common souls mechanics, with a focus around bosses. I had a ton of fun with Momodora: RUtM, as is evidenced by my playtime relative to that of everyone else\\'s reviews. \\nMost of the other reviews you\\'ll read for this game will compare it to Dark Souls, and yes, that is a good comparison: The enemy attacks do a lot of damage, and it takes a bit of skill to beat this game, however, there is an easy mode, and I think it is accommodating enough that anyone who\\'s played video games before should at least be able to handle the game on easy with few problems. \\nThe controls and mechanics are tight, and excellently polished, and Kaho controls very nicely (this is coming from someone who actually did beat the game on insane mode, where one hit will kill you, and I never would have even attempted that if I thought the controls weren\\'t tight enough)\\nThere\\'s even a new game plus mode, which I haven’t actually tried yet, despite the time I\\'ve sent playing this game, most of it was getting 100% completion, beating all of the bosses without taking a hit (which gives you extra items, and is practically mandatory on hard or insane mode) and getting all of the achievements in the game.\\n\\nTLDR: I\\'m not normally a huge fan of platformers, but this one is a blast with a bit of challenge, but it\\'s by no means impossible. It is reminiscent of Dark Souls, and I mean that in the best possible way.\\n\\nThe reason I even found out about, and decided to buy this game, was because of this video: \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KKT-xv_VBY\\n\\nAnd I have no regrets, so maybe check it out.\\n A mix of Dark Souls and Metroid, this game rewards exploration. No hand holding here, you choose where to go, who to fight. Music is great, Gameplay is well balanced, Highly recommended This game is a metroidvania with an unique Dark Souls feeling. It has GORGEOUS pixelart graphics with beautiful animations, excellent controls and a very nice and fitting atmospheric soundtrack. \\n\\nYou are a priestess that uses a maple leaf as a weapon. What\\'s more awesome than that?! \\n\\nThe story could be deeper and the game itself is very straightforward. It lacks that feeling you have when you play other metroidvanias, when you need to get a new ability to reach a certain area [spoiler] (you can morph into a cat to reach narrow places, that\\'s all)[/spoiler]. It could be better in that aspect. The map is fairly large but you don\\'t get to revisit some areas more than once. Also, the game could be longer.\\n\\nDespite those flaws, it\\'s an amazing game. It\\'s very challenging due to it\\'s unforgiving style. Those who played Dark Souls series will immediately relate, because it\\'s just like that: you die, you get back to the last checkpoint; unless you get used to dodging, you can get whooped in just one hit; the game doesn\\'t tell you what to do or point your next objective on the map, it\\'s all up to you to find out; You even have Dark Soul-esque recovery items that replenishes when you get to a checkpoint. With all these features, it becomes a very rewarding game.\\n\\n8/10. Solid, beautiful game. It is a short experience but a good one. The pixel art is fluid and nice to look at. The game play is pretty tight. The story is basic but the ending gives it more interest. The only issue was gauging when a roll should be performed while going through certain enemies (to dodge)- sometimes I thought i could make it by but there just was\\'nt enough space after all. That part can be a bit of trial and error. Timing is key too. Overall, great fun while it lasted. Wow... Feels like this game came up out of nowhere, and swept me away. \\n\\nFor starters, you\\'re left a little curious as to which fork to take, but take the wrong one and you\\'ll be met with either a quick death, or a dead end (at least until later). \\n\\nPros:\\n- Great Artstyle\\n- Great Soundtrack\\n- Great Level Design\\n- Beautiful Animations\\n- Battle Mechanics are Flawless (at least to my knowledge).\\n- Normal Difficulty is good even for players who like a challenge, but would also like to progress though the story sooner. :)\\n\\nCons:\\n- A bit short, but oh well.\\n\\nOverall just an amazing game, a must buy imo! 9.8/10!! -0.2 for the length of the game.\\n\\n-----\\nSide note: I believe this was just an issue on my end, but I couldn\\'t get my ps3 controller to work with this game. You can only take two hits before you die. If you\\'re going to be THAT rude, you should at least give me something as mechanically interesting as Volgarr at the very least. Castlevania-level quality would be nice but that game didn\\'t need to two-shot you to be interesting.\\n\\nMomodora Reverie just is not at that level.\\n\\nIt\\'s bog-standard with only a couple of tricks: Lifted from Dark Souls was a silly refillable health potion and other buff items system that really isn\\'t necessary outside of a Souls-style game (Insultingly, the refillable health potions don\\'t refill enough of your health to undo the one hit you can take. But they aren\\'t slow enough that you have to stop the fight to heal like you did in Souls. Why not just double my anemic health bar?). Worse, you have a roll. Don\\'t get me wrong, if you\\'re making an action game like Shank, Dishwasher, Streets of Fury, Aces Wild etc, a roll is welcome. But Momodora is closer to a low-budget two-hit-kill Mega Man than any of those games, and your roll never feels right*, it never ends up in the right position, and, combined with the ridiculous forward momentum on the melee, the combat feels graceless and greasy.\\n\\nOh, and that\\'s all you do. Because like Momodora 3 the levels are just there to give you stuff to hop over, a bit like Kirby only less fun.\\n\\n*Of course, thinking about it, your character\\'s sprite is massive. There\\'s no way you\\'re dodging between or around ANY shots beyond one or two, so of course we need a roll with iframes rather than let you duck and weave like any other Mega Man-esque game.\\n\\n(edit: also this game was made by the pronoun crew) I remember keeping up with this game since it was called \"Momodora IV.\" The series has only grown bigger and better with each installment, and this game is a testament to that. Reverie Under the Moonlight is by far the most refined and fleshed out game of the entire series. At first, I thought that this was going to have the more linear structure of Momodora III, but then the game slowly but surely branched out into multiple paths. The combat is incredibly satisfying; the game does a great job of letting you know that you were damaging an enemy (and that enemies were hitting you). The soundtrack is beautiful and truly lends itself to the atmosphere of the game. The enemies are laid out to actually compliment the level design and to make you think differently about each encounter. Though the power-ups themselves aren\\'t quite as satisfying as other metroidvanias on the market, I still got pretty giddy at times. Where this game truly shines is its boss battles (although at one point the pacing falters); they give you a very good challenge without being unfair, and they get progressively more difficult to reflect your progress. Between this game and Pony Island, 2016 is off to a very good start.\\n\\n9/10 This is a really amazing game. The gameplay is too good and with lots of nice spells. And a very polished, visually-stunning 2D metroidvania game with a Dark Souls-like atmosphere. The music is so epic too and diverse. Great environments and everything. This game is worth every dollar. My only possible complaint would be the bow and arrow was over-powered in boss fights and the game was a tad short. But the good far outweighs the bad. This is my Game of The Year right now. I recommend starting the game on hard difficulty for those out there looking for the best experience. Great gameplay and style. Very much reminded me of Dark Souls, in both the combat and storytelling, which, in my opinion, is a very good thing. Overall awesome game. Finally, a game tagged with Metroidvania that actually is one.\\n\\nBonus, the pixel art is very well done.  You stop even noticing the pixels with a lot of the scapes.\\n\\nThe only strong gripe I have against this game is the length.  It\\'s more of a long demo of a game than what feels like a fully fleshed out experience.\\n\\n Solid gameplay, beautiful animations, and rewarding difficulty makes this game a joy to play. Nice animation and gameplay, adequate diff. Very nice. Great game HARD IS FOR THE CHAMPIONS!!!1!11!!\\n\\nIF YOU PLAY ON EASY, U SUX\\n\\nIF YOU PLAY ON NORMAL, GIT GUD\\n\\n\\n10000/10 It\\'s like if Dark Souls was actually fun to control! It\\'s like if you took Metroid, Castlevania, Dark Souls, Bloodborne and shoved them into a blender and hit puree. Also sugar, spice and giant witch tits to make the perfect experience and the best Momodora game to date! A game that wants to be Metroidvania crossed with Dark Souls. and it almost gets it right. I don\\'t think it fully understands either genre at their core.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t quite get the pacing of exploration and upgrades to call it a good Metroid style of game. the map is a bit too linear, with a few obvious shortcuts between areas, and marked inaccessible areas that you can backtrack to later for secret trinkets. Though there\\'s only one ability that really matters for exploration: transforming into a cat. The rest is just finding specific keys instead of abilities, though the map doesn\\'t give a clear sense of direction for the non-linear mid-game. You don\\'t really advance in power very much, as even if you find a bunch of new items, they all must compete for your 5 equipment slots. You can swap them out in the pause menu, but it\\'s so much of a hassle I didn\\'t bother except during boss fights. however, the offensive upgrades are so ridiculously good that every other item seems superfluous.\\n\\nAnd though the game goes for higher than average difficulty, it\\'s no Dark Souls either. it\\'s a little too easy to learn enemy patterns, since it\\'s just a 2D platformer. for defense and maneuvering, rolling solves everything. honestly, most of the difficulty is in the damage you take when hit (on Normal or above). even with a lot of HP upgrades, you can maybe survive 5 hits instead of 3. the refillable healing items, though similar to Estus, seem more like a crutch than a feature. \"I can brute force this many mistakes.\" In other words, it\\'s an easy game that punishes you hard when you slip up, instead of a hard game that gives you some freedom for trial and error.\\n\\nDespite all those flaws, I still really like this game and think it\\'s worth it. From the above influences I mentioned, it also does so many things right. Boss fights are fun and intense, and feel much more balanced to the game system. The platforming and action are so smooth and fine tuned. The creepy atmosphere and feeling of isolation. Fragmented and intentionally vague storyline that requires some piecing together. Very minimal use of cutscenes (whew!) but still some interesting NPCs that flesh out the setting. Well, I wish you could interact with the NPCs a little more, such as when you\\'re a cat. Missed opportunity, I demand more cat gameplay.\\n\\nDo I even need to mention the graphics when you can watch the trailer yourself? It\\'s amazing, and I\\'m not easily impressed. Far too many indie games go for ~rEtRo PiXeLs~ without knowing how to properly use them. some of them compensate with overly fluid animation that looks completely out of place... or worse, pseudo-minimalism. But this game is a genuine example of pixel art done tastefully. And to be honest, I really love the CaveStory-esque flat color sprites. I want more games in that style.\\n\\nEDIT: In retrospect I think my review sounded too nitpicky and negative, so I wanted to clarify. I\\'m comparing this game to the very best, only because it strived for perfection. It\\'s so rare to find a retro-style indie game with this much ambition! Momodora aimed for the stars, and while I think it didn\\'t quite hit its goal, it\\'s still light years above ALL the competition.\\n\\nI have a feeling that the creator\\'s next game will be even better. Murdered a giant witch by slapping her boobs with a maple leaf\\n\\n420/69 GOTY A charming little metroidvania that knows just when to be glum and just when to be cute. Pick it up if you like cute and glum things, or even if you somehow like neither of the two. An amazing game. graphics good, animations crisp, hard difficulty a challenge, insane is to crazy for me . Beautiful and wonderful to play Great game! Excelent game. love mechanics and atmosphere. The only complaint I have is how the difficulty differences are handled (on easy you start out with maxed out health and such), but hardly a major complaint. good game if you like good games Cute 2D Dark Souls Well made platformer, much fun such game.\\n\\n Why are there no curators for this masterpiece yet god dammit\\n\\nEdit: Happy to see this game finally get the attention it deserves. Pros\\n\\nGreat gameplay\\nDecent story\\n\\nCons\\n\\nShort = Finished it in 5 hours. I wished there was more.\\nArt = Being kinda picky, but I wished it was better looking like other side scrollers (Dragon\\'s Crown). Short, but sweet. Very well made and oozing with atmosphere. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight:\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  \\nAn evil curse is floating through the land. On the shoreline, a priestess who comes from the village of Lun has arrived. She needs to get an audience with the queen to save the region. Will she get this audience in time or will it be too late?\\nMomodara: Reverie Under the Moonlight, is a 2D platformer with really great pixel artworks. This game is the fourth in the series. You will take control of the priestess of Lun and you will be armed with extraordinary weapons - I’ll give it to you straight up: a maple leaf and a bow, for good measure. Every time you kill an enemy not only will he or she vanish, but pink diamonds (that’s what I will call them) appear for the taking. Basically, it’s money, and you will be able to purchase items from some characters with them. Writing this, you will come across a chest which also holds plenty of money. In some places, you will be able to investigate and you will earn interesting items which you can equip you in your active or passive slots from your inventory.  To give you an example, you might have in the active slot (three slots in total) “Bellflower” and every time you activate it, you will regenerate more health. In regards to the passive slots (of which you have two), it could be the “Astral Charm” which enables you to get more money each time you get rid of an enemy. \\n\\nIn terms of bosses, they are interesting, and when you find the right pattern, you will be able to eliminate them pretty quickly. Bear in mind, I have being playing this game in the normal difficulty; if you want to step the difficulty up you can do so and try the hard difficulty.\\n\\nIn terms of the controls, they are slick and responsive. You will be able to jump, double jump and roll to avoid an enemy or their projectiles but also get behind them for the kill. Slash your way through with your exceptional Maple Leaf or use your bow easily.\\n\\nGraphically, I really enjoy the pixel artworks and animations. The soundtrack is good and the levels are well-designed.\\n\\nPositives:\\n~~~~~~~ \\n\\n-\\tGreat Pixel Artworks and animations\\n-\\tLevels are very well-designed\\n-\\tGood and fluid controls\\n-\\tTrading cards and achievements\\n\\nNegatives:\\n~~~~~~~~  \\n\\n-\\tCould be more challenging\\n\\nMomodara: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a very good 2D platformer. For me it was a pleasant surprise!\\n\\n8/10\\n\\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\\n\\n[url=https://www.zeepond.com/reviews][b]EPIC “THE CPT FROGGY” REVIEWS UP NOW ON ZEEPOND, THE HOME OF THE ALMIGHTY FROG![/b][/url]\\n\\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thecptfroggyclub#curation][b]FOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE[/b][/url] Awesome Game An extremely good game, if a bit short. The combat is smooth and responsive, and the art is stunning. Has one of the best soundtracks I\\'ve heard in a long time as well.  The difficulty is a bit high, but nothing too bad, I was able to beat most bosses within a few tries. Also has good replayability value, with New Game+ and multiple difficulties to try, with various achievements that are challenging to get that could keep you playing for a while. The best not-quite trania. This game is a modern classic in the grand traditions of Symphony of the Night and Cave Story.\\n\\nThe graphics and music are beautiful, the controls are crisp, the combat is fun and strategic, the pacing of the game is tight; it\\'s hard to say it does anything wrong at all.\\n\\nReflecting on this game is reverie itself. Highly recommended for any Souls or Metroidvania fan. If you like both, even better. This game is only about 3-4 hours long give or take but it is highly entertaining and always rewardingly challenging. It\\'s a Metroid-Vania game with 2D souls-styled combat. Controls are tight as hell, and the feedback from attacks feel absolutely delicious. Who knew hitting things with a leaf could feel so satisfying?\\n\\nThe art and animation are great as well. The pixel sprites are smooth and fluid, and the characters are all very cutesy, despite the darker, more taxing atmosphere that the environment gives off. It all feels very Touhou inspired as well, due to the high amount of female characters, and since the main character is a priestess. It\\'s like a perfect blend of Touhou, Castlevania, and Dark Souls, as far as the atmosphere and art goes.\\n\\nAnyways, I could ramble on about how gorgeous the game looks and make comparisons to other games for days but no one would want to read it and at any rate the main thing to take home is that it\\'s a really freaking fun game. It\\'s worth it. Buy it. I like the whole series, and this one is a big step up in terms of graphics - it\\'s a very pretty game.\\nIt\\'s quite hard, but not stupidly hard, and it\\'s satisfying to play all the way through.\\n\\nThere\\'s some balancing issues though - the final boss is easier than a lot of earlier bosses, and poison absorption + poison arrows let\\'s you heal yourself, which seems a bit overpowered. Extremely well made game.\\n\\nCombat is great, Movement is fluid and on point, level design is very good.\\nAll this mixed up with adorable and very well made pixel art.\\n\\nI can only recommend it. Momodora: Bloodborne\\n\\nAnd in my opinion, better than Salt And Sanctuary. 👌 This game is fantastic. It has great gameplay with the Dark Souls-esque item system, the focus on dodging and the interconnected design, but what really sells the game for me is the graphics and soundtrack. The game excels at giving each area a unique ambience, to the point where it is satisfying to just walk around while seeping in the atmosphere. Pros:\\n\\n+ Haunting atmosphere\\n+ Fantastic art\\n+ Good music\\n+ Liberal save points\\n+ Bosses aren\\'t too hard (if you remember to use all your items)\\n+ Great fusion of Dark Souls and Metroidvania\\n+ Stun locking enemies and invincible rolling make combat really interesting\\n+ No filler (4-6 hours)\\n+ Multiple difficulty levels (easy/normal/hard)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Game does not explain that ALL ITEMS are restocked at save points for free!\\n- I wish the game was a little longer or had more playable characters\\n- Spikes are an INSTANT KILL... probably should\\'ve just made them half health imo\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nI\\'ve played this game twice now, and I almost never replay games. This game is an absolute gem. Just buy it already. Game is  a must have 2d game lovers\\nAmazing game,  perfect animation and game play , amazing sound track .\\n\\n\\nDownsides  :  it is short but the ending could have a better narrative to it... also past the middle of the game there are almost no dialogues. This is an amazing game! I haven\\'t played any of the other Momodora game but this game has been exceptionally enjoyable.  It only took me a few hours to beat, but there were very few points where i wasn\\'t having much fun.\\n\\nIt has a Dark Souls feel to it without feeling like a dark souls clone.  It uses healing items the renew at checkpoints (in addition to any other consumable item), challenging boss fights (that give bonuses give you defeat them without getting hit for a reason to go back to them), and a nice, sprawling map that loops back (with shortcuts and eventual warping).  All of these things exist outside of Dark Souls as well, but playing the game I got a distinct feeling that the devs had played Dark Souls and wanted to incorporate some elements of Dark Souls\\' design into their game.  There is some platforming but it never feel terribly unfair or frustrating.  And, all in all, I think it works very well and the game felt great to play.\\n\\nThere\\'s no change in weapons but it didn\\'t seem needed; the game felt well balanced around the moves and weapons you have.  I will say that some of the extra rewards for defeating bosses without getting hit break the power curve a bit, but you\\'re not likely to get them on your first playthrough so I doubt it would cause most players any issue.\\n\\nI struggled the most at the beginning (mostly getting into a groove) but once I got going with few issues.  There were a few points where I was stuck wondering where to go, but pulling up the map (Castlevania SotN/Super Metroid styled) and checking areas that weren\\'t fully explored eventually got me to where I needed to be.\\n\\nThe pixel art was very well done; absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The title is a particular standout though there are plenty of good touches throughout the game.  Grass rustles as you run through it, hanging lanterns move when there\\'s anything that shakes the screen, water has refection, there\\'s all sort of details that give the game an extra bit of life.\\n\\nThe music in this game was fantastic; it never overpowered the game but most certainly added to the atmosphere very well.  I don\\'t know the best way to put it into words, but there was never a track that played that drew my attention away from the game and yet was memorable enough for comment.\\n\\nAll in all, I would recommend this to anyone who likes metroidvania games, Dark Souls, or action platformers.  I bought it on a whim and it\\'s been one of the most solid gaming experiences I\\'ve had recently.  It\\'s short (I beat it in about 3-4 hours), but it never drags so I say that the length is appropriate. good sidescroller audio seems a little eh but great overall love the atmosphere\\n This is game is amazing, especially for the price. \\nTragic story, tight controls and lots of secrets. As if Dark Souls were made in 2D.\\n\\nI played through on Hard difficulty and it takes just under 10 hours if you take your time exploring. An excellent, though not massively long, action platformer with an emphasis on exploration. On the Positive side, it has fantastic presentation with strong atmosphere, detailed and well designed pixel art with a lot of personality, fun combat and very good music. Controls are very responsive and easy to use. The story and character interactions are minimal, but that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing for a game like this. Like in Metroid, an unobtrusive plot allows for better immersion. \\n\\nOn the negative side, while there\\'s plenty of items, there are no extra weapons. You only ever have the two that you start with. Also, while it has a good level of difficulty most of the way though, it suddenly gets kind of easy towards the end. The final stage is not very particularly dangerous (I didn\\'t die even once going through it) and the last three bosses are pushovers. Also, it would have been cool to have some more extras, like be able to unlock Cath as a playable character or something, but if the game is good I can\\'t too much about a lack of extras.\\n\\nI would strongly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this style of game or platformers generally. It doesn\\'t really re-invent the genre forged by Metroid/SoTN in any way, but it\\'s a good example of what makes games like that great. Died on the second enemy. 10/10 Castlevania but as a priestess with a leaf. Makes a leaf look effective, something Toronto hasn\\'t accomplished since 1967. \\n\\nGo wings.\\n\\n10/10 I wasn\\'t familiar with this series at all two weeks ago, but after playing Momodora III I knew I had to jump immediately into Reverie Under the Moonlight.\\n\\nIn the big picture, it\\'s a well-executed medium-length Metroidvania-style action platformer. What really makes it come together are the tight controls, great interconnected level design, and a moveset in which all the possible actions complement each other very well. It uses a setup very reminescent of Dark Souls when it comes to save points, useable items and eventually warping, and these mechanics help to keep up the tension throughout.\\n\\nOh, and as someone who is indifferent to most pixel art, I still have to say that this game\\'s art and animations are absolutely gorgeous and make the best of the medium. Really good game. Fun, challenging, it\\'s like a Bloodborne platformer. This is a great Metroidvania game. The boss fights are great! I also appreciate the roll, hitting detection, arrow charge, and the combo mechanic, and then I found out you can be a cat! Is there anything this game doesn\\'t have? I look forward to the developer\\'s future games. I will get them all.\\n\\nI wish you can change difficulty setting on the 2nd play through...and maybe a boss rush mode? Just finished this game with True ending.\\nThis game is very fun, but I think fighting with bosses by bow make this game too easy, it would be more fun and challenge to fight bosses with melee only.\\nI love animations and soundtracks of this game too.\\n\\nbut I dont like warp system since I cant remember names of each places in the map.\\n\\n7.5/10 A bit of a metroidvania type game with the atmosphere of a dark souls title (stated by others). The game isn\\'t overly difficult on normal settings but the earlier parts of the game can be pretty brutal if you aren\\'t patient.\\n\\nThis is the third(?) in a series but my first time checking out any of the titles. There isn\\'t that much story to be seen here as the action and exploring takes precedent. Nice visuals, fun exploration, and beautiful music help keep the game afloat. The game was about five hours in total. I enjoyed my time with it overall but became bored in some some spots. Great metroidvania with good level design and a Souls-esque map progression while also having a fluid combat system. \\nGood bosses and sadistically placed enemies who will frequently 1-2 shot you on Hard difficulty makes up for the relatively short playtime. Easily my favorite game in the first quarter of 2016! Though, I could see this remaining first on the list through the rest of the year. Other reviewers did a lovely job at covering the game, so I\\'m not going to write much, just wanted to rate/recommend.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fan of the series, or a fan of the genre, you won\\'t regret picking up this game. <3 [b]BMR Rating 4.5 Out of 5.[/b]\\n[spoiler]https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlYKAqZb2lz0K6x9ut9JiOe3u0JZ0Rzj1[/spoiler]\\n\\nThe game looks great, specially for a Pixel Platformer. I like the story so far. Got a bit tilted on some bosses but feels good when you overcome them. The little red riding hood -kinda theme that Momo has really hits my good sides.\\n\\nHey, if you\\'re not a fan of platformer games, I get you, I get you man, trust me I don\\'t like Platformer type of games too but you should try this and decide for yourself if the \\'FUN\\' overcomes your \\'Angst\\' for this game. waste of time, bad design in most areas makes this a pale castlevania clone I absolutely love this game! If you are a fan of the Metroidvania genre, this is a must-have!\\n\\nThe game doesn\\'t hold your hand, but overcoming a difficult area or a boss feels very rewarding. Much like the Souls games, from which this game has borrowed a few elements like limited save points and an Estus-like gameplay mechanic.\\n\\nInsane difficulty is a real challenge, but nothing impossible. A hidden true ending and new game plus give this game great replay value. A truly enchanting game. Highly reccomended.Although this is the forth title in the series, this was my first . Going to go back and  pick up Momodora three.\\n\\nHope to see the first two installments on steam at some point in the future.\\n\\nThanks to the creative team for this work of art. It was ok. 10/10 >Hit a witch in the jugs\\n>Beat her\\n>Accidentally walked into the water\\n>Immediately die\\n>Drat, forgot to save\\n>mfw that means more witch jugs action\\n\\n10/10 This has got to be the best game I\\'ve reviewed this year.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnGjbNVQHJc I love this game. Having played Momodora 3 i expected a short game but i was suprised by it\\'s length and how beautiful this game is. Definitely worth your time and money. This is a pretty okey game. I have never done a review of anything before but this made me want to do one sense I have tried my best to 100% it and all. I personally dont really like platformering pixelish games but this one cought my attention for some reason. The artstyle is really nice. In-game enviorments have some pretty cool contrasts when it comes to colouring and what not. It was really fun, the story could have been made a little more straightforward however. Alot of the world is hidden in item descriptions, and is very ugh.. \\'\\'Souls-ish\\'\\', dont really have a better way to describe it. \\n    Gameplay is pretty straight forward, Dodge button Melee button Ranged Attack button. Then you have the activatable items wich can be anything from flowers with thorns that heal you or a bloody tissue that shoots blue balls of magic. I thought the game was very EASY and that was on my first playthrough on Hard Mode (and I\\'am not a very dedicated 2D platformer action RPG whatever this is player). So if you are more experienced with these kinds of games I\\'d recommend rushing HM and then doing NG+.\\n\\nSome small stuff like not being able to animation cancel might put people off but its a fun game none the less and I\\'d reccomend it if you want some pretty fun boss battles. \\\\o/ My god this game is so good\\n\\nI don\\'t even care enough to say more than that, if you watch the trailer and think to yourself \"man, this looks like something I might like\", yes, you will, it\\'s great, that\\'s all Fantastic pixel art, a good soundtrack and excellent gameplay. What more could you ask for? \\nI found the platforming to be fun and engaging and the boss fights were very well designed with a few examples of genius. This is a game that is absolute quality throughout the whole game and I never felt like any part of the game or any particular boss fight was a drag or somehow less developed than the others. A feat worth applause. I played the game on Normal difficulty and felt that the game\\'s balance was great. It was challenging but I never felt it was unfair.\\n\\nThis is a game that will probably fly under most peoples\\' radar, which is a shame. This game is a labor of love and it shows. There is great detail and care put into each aspect in the game to make it feel \\'just right\\', bordering on perfection. If you have any interest in Metroidvania games then give the game a go. It\\'s a bit on the short side, I finished it in 4 hours, but felt that it was well worth it as that was 4 hours of consistent quality. Can\\'t wait to play Momodora 5. One of the few games I have played recently where the music drew me into the world as I explored. The music alone is worth playing this game. There are difficulty options that allow players to take in the environment and cruise through the combat as well as cranking up the challenge and getting one shot by a normal enemy. \\n\\nI can\\'t exclaim enough how well the environments have been crafted to loop around and connect with eachother. Momorda feels like the designer truly thought out level placement and key locations allowing players shortcuts to savepoints and progression paths. This isnt a randomly generated map, and it shouldnt be. If thats what you are looking for then move on, as Momorda is hand crafted to feel like a world. I love it level design.\\n\\nEnemy placement as well as boss design is top notch. Bosses have recognizable patterns (you might die a few times before seeing the patterns) that allow for skillful dodging through abilities. \\n\\nThe combat has a very meaty feel. You attack with a weapon that seems like it wouldnt work, but when your character cuts an imp in half and the screen shakes you suddenly realize she isnt to be messed with. One minor gripe I have with the combat is that it is two directional. Left or Right, the player is unable to attack upward or downward (with either the melee or ranged weapon). This initially was strange but is a minor annoyance to someone who has played metroid and is used to being able to shoot in eight directions.\\n\\nVery recommended. Best game I\\'ve played in a good while, certainly gonna be more memorable than a majority of the games we got last year. seriously this game is special. In a way it harkons to Dark Souls and demonsouls in that you meet neutral npcs that all have their own tragic stories that you really have to look for and I loved it. On the flip side it rivals even the best MetroidVania games including the namesake of the genre. Most Def worth a full playthrough and worth every cent and beyond.\\n\\n*Edit* This game actually got me to write a review and I\\'ve never given enough Fu*ks to do so It\\'s good! It\\'s a fairly standard metroidvania that takes about 5/6 hours to beat. \\nIt\\'s very challenging, but has lower difficulties if you can\\'t nail the dodging mechanic. Very much worth the low asking price.\\n\\nThere are very few traditional \"ability upgrades\" that unlock new areas, it\\'s more the kind of game where you can get around nearly everywhere from the start. But there\\'s still a lot of exploration to be done.\\n\\nGraphics are brilliant but I can\\'t say anything good about the audio unfortunately. There\\'s almost no music throughout the whole game to give off a certain feel/ambience but I think it hurts a lot more than it helps. Sounds are contrastly pretty loud and grainy sounding.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to have played previous titles to enjoy this game (I haven\\'t)\\n\\n Best game I\\'ve played all year!!! Fun and challenging, especially on harder difficulties. The art design,while simple, is beautiful. And the soundtrack is fantastic. A must have for any fan of the old school Castlevania games. This game is great. Don\\'t use a guide. I got really into exploring and figuring out what to do and what NOT to do. \\n\\nIt starts out REALLY hard though. Way too short. Barely any exploration. Bosses that seemed random and didnt fit with the flow of the story. Tedious rooms. Found out about warp far too late having to run around and check every dead end to see if the key I got was for that door. Basically feel like I wasted my time. The game had potential but it lacked any substance at all. I am extremely disappointed. A major improvement over previous installments with Bloodborne visual inspiration intact. Much darker than Momodora 1-3 when it comes to themes, dialogues and overall design. The longer story and better characterization are still left to be desired, but it\\'s, as it always goes for Momodora games, justified by how polished it is for what it\\'s worth. And surprisingly, RUtM shines the most in technical aspect, meaning the controls are precise, the button layout on the gamepad is nothing short of perfect and the itemization is designed to not burden the player. One game series I won\\'t worry about, considering how every new entry just gets better and better. If you consider yourself a fan of metroidvanias, then this game is a must own. this is one of the best metroidvanias in recent memory, thanks to great level design, responsive, tight and satisfying controls, excellent bosses (for the most part), and a great presentation.\\nAny bad points i can think of are pretty nitpicky, but here goes. For one, one of the abilities you get couldve been mapped to its own button, as opposed to taking up an item slot. its slightly tedious having to switch the item off and on again.\\nspeaking of abilities, an abilitie for faster vertical movement would\\'ve been nice, as it would be good way to speed through areas your back tracking through.\\nand finally, one of the bosses in the game is pretty boring and uninspired. when you see it, youll know what i mean. though to be fair, there are at least some neat visual things going on.\\n\\nOverall, this is a fantastic metroidvania thats well worth your time. Right away I was unsure about this game due to it\\'s long tounge twister of a name.  I had never heard of this series before and I\\'m always cautious of games that look they might be trying to be heavy on the Kawaii.  Luckily my fears ended up being completely unfounded.  The visuals in this game won me over almost instantly.  From the very first area, all the way to the last this game features stunning pixel art.  It\\'s the little touches like interactive grass, reflections in the water as you run along the dock, and fog rolling over the canals that bring this world to life.  These details show a level of quality that sticks throughout the entire game.  \\n\\nThe combat was fun, a wonderful mix of challenging but responsive.  Winning boss fights felt like a challenge and were very rewarding to actually finish.  The exploration works well as the maps are well designed.  There\\'s always a reason to explore more whether you\\'re looking for new items, more health, or little collectables.  The only thing I wasn\\'t impressed by was the story.  it was alright but I felt that maybe I was missing out on some details since I had never played the previous installments.  Maybe this is my own fault but for a game that seems to be aimed at introducing new people to the series there were some details that would have been nice to understand better.\\n\\nFull Video review for those interested:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ4xGkbEQ8w You can play as a cat Great platforming, beautiful animations and graphics, and an amazing story.\\n(Also you fight with a leaf..) I really like how the controls are, but one thing I\\'d like is the ability to change the controller controls, as you have allowed the change of keyboard ones. \\nThis game is fun, yet challenging, and I will admit that I am having some trouble adapting to the enemies attacks, and it leads to a quick death. I enjoy this type of thing. It makes me want to learn how to dodge their attacks and think up new ways to beat them. I really like what you do. Keep it up. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a great step forward in the series. While staying relatively short in the grand scheme like the others, easily being possible to speed run in a little over thirty minutes if you absolutely know what you\\'re doing, a first run through will take roughly six hours. This game actually takes advantage of a non-linear playstyle much like Metroid or good Castlevania games (Metroidvania). Before this game, Momodora had only teased at most around a game that could follow this format, but ultimately felt entirely linear. As it stands, this game lays a really fun foundation for a game akin to great titles such as Symphony of the Night, with very evident nods to the Castlevania series being present within this game. Awesome game. Very Dark Souls-ish with a great soundtrack. Good controls too. The first thing that caught my attention (and is the reason that I bought the game) was the gorgeous artwork. I saw two screenshots and was like, \"Well, I\\'m buying that right now.\" Didn\\'t even look at the trailer. And I gotta tell you, I\\'m SO glad I did, because \\'Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight\\' is an absolutely fantastic game.\\n\\n-- PROS --\\n\\n- Gorgeous, big sprites with excellent animation (I like the little touches like the leaves that appear when she double jumps, how her legs move when she jumps (cute socks!) and the variety of attack animations)\\n- Detailed, lovingly rendered backgrounds (I found it awesome how the backgrounds were SO DETAILED and yet were not distracting (this is actually pretty hard to do) - and every area has unique touches not in other areas - skulls, brickwork, trees, etc)\\n- Great atmosphere. As soon as you enter the main city of the game, you know it - and the dark, foreboding tone is tangible and exciting. VERY well done.\\n- Really good music - I found myself replaying areas just to listen to the music (which is always a great sign!)\\n- The presentation throughout is just top notch. Gorgeous pixel art, the menus are really well done and snappy, the UI is clear and immediately understandable - Just really, really well done.\\n- Interesting, varied enemies to fight.\\n- Exciting (and often surprising) boss battles.\\n- The pacing is also really well done. I never felt overwhelmed - and the checkpoints (which are unique, \\'Smack that bell!\\') are placed far enough apart to be challenging, but no so far as to be unfair.\\n- Finally, I just found the experience very compelling. Once I starting playing, I HAD to keep going. I had to see where this story went. \\n\\n-- CONS --\\n\\n- I don\\'t believe the engine the game was written in supports vsync, so when I was scrolling the map around, there was some screen tearing. This was the only place in the game where this happened to me, and it\\'s not a deal breaker, but I thought I\\'d mention it. \\n- The game does start pretty difficult. It\\'s by design, since it\\'s making sure that the player understands essential things (like how to dodge through enemies to get behind them), but I can see how this could turn some people off. The difficulty cools off once you get to the city and then slowly ramps up again. So, that\\'s good. Again, this is not THAT bad, but I thought I\\'d mention it. (these are more nitpicks than anything else)\\n\\n-- TL;DR --\\n\\nA fantastic, very well made action platformer with great tone and engaging gameplay. Once I started playing I couldn\\'t stop and it took me nine hours to beat the game (with 100% completion of the map - I like to look for secrets ^_^). This is the fourth \\'Momodora\\' game, and it\\'s by far the most polished. (Don\\'t worry if you haven\\'t played any of the other games in the series, though - This one stands by itself). I absolutely enjoyed this game and eagerly look forward to whatever the developer works on next! \\n\\n-- FINAL GRADE --\\n\\n9 out of 10 [h1]Castlevania fans rejoice![/h1]\\n\\nI\\'ve been following the developer (rdein) for a long time and Momodora: RUtM (Momodora IV) is his best game yet. Metroidvania fans will feel right at home — a lot of the reviews so far compare it to Dark Souls (mainly because you can roll to dodge), but Momodora IV is actually much closer to its genre namesakes, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Super Metroid. That said, rdein is a Dark Souls fan and the game\\'s atmosphere draws a lot of similarities from it.\\n\\nMy controls: Dualshock 3 with Xinput wrapper\\n\\n[b]GAME MECHANICS:[/b]\\n+ They put a lot of effort into making all the hitboxes and attack animations feel just right. (I had a chance to help rdein tune attack hitstun animations while he was developing this game so I know he cares a great deal about how his game plays, and feedback from the community.)\\n+ One of the biggest drawbacks of previous titles was clunky movement and combat, but in Momodora IV the movement/controls have been vastly improved — possibly the best you can make it with this game engine.\\n+ Attacks are smooth and act like you expect them to. There\\'s enough of a learning curve for each weapon to keep it interesting.\\n\\n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]\\n+ The game is linear but exploration-based. There are enough secrets to make backtracking and exploration worth it.\\n+ New enemy types throughout keep the game fresh and challenging. Boss fights are a treat!\\n+ [spoiler]Multiple endings give decent replay value.[/spoiler]\\n+ Items have variety without being overwhelming.\\n- Item management is a little clunky because you have to cycle through active items during combat.\\n\\n[b]ART DIRECTION & STYLE:[/b]\\n+ Backgrounds for each level are absolutely gorgeous.\\n+ The music is fantastic and matches each level.\\n+ Unlike the previous titles, the theme and atmosphere is darker, yet it keeps the story simple. Draws similarities from Dark Souls and Bloodborne while keeping its own unique style.\\n+ Characters have just enough backstory to make them interesting, and re-appearances throughout the game are compelling.\\n+ Dialogue is well-written and follows the game\\'s theme, and dialogue animations are a nice touch.\\n+ Character sprites and overall character design is great — which isn\\'t surprising since rdein draws all concept art himself.\\n\\n[b]FINAL SCORE: 9/10[/b]\\nI wish this game was longer! Hopefully Momodora V will be a much longer game because I loved this one. Short but fun. Love the artstyle, and the game doesn\\'t hold your hand. Worth the 8bux. short but GG The art style was very charming and the graphics look so pretty! I\\'m currently playing it over again just because of the art and music. The bossfights are very difficult for me, but they were so fun to experience. The smooth transitions in the fight make it feel natural. Also if you like cats, i reccomend this game. Quick Review: While I really enjoyed playing Momodora: RUTM there were a few bad design choices that really interfered with my want to completely love this game. The combat and platforming are completely solid, but some enemies were pointlessly frustrating. Including long sections of platforming, especially with moving platforms, with limitless spawning enemies that fly underneath you (where your weapon can\\'t reach), knocking you into instakill spikes, was just tedious.\\nI enjoyed exploring, but found it far too easy to wander into the next boss battle without completing an area, with little incentive to go back rather than continuing the story (boss battles should be the cherry atop the completed cake).\\nSave points were mostly plentiful, but I wonder why they appeared after every boss except the winged girl atop the castle? It was a fun, if not rather simple battle, that I didn\\'t mind repeating (and then going back to the previous save), but it just seemed like an odd choice.\\nThe leadup to the Queen was anticlimactic, I really wasn\\'t expecting her around the next corner with no introduction other than her name appearing on the screen. I realise none of the bosses had much of a leadup, but we\\'d been hearing about the cursed Queen for such a long time I thought she\\'d do more than appear and start fighting me in the same few seconds. We had a dialogue with almost every other boss (even if the Queen can\\'t speak, an attempt at conversation would be appreciated, only to realise that she truly is lost in her current form).\\nI deserved the bad ending because by the end I was just so over it, I just wanted to keep forging ahead as I really didn\\'t enjoy some of the later segments (I found the latter part of the castle a bore, boss battles aside). I don\\'t know what the right decision for Cath was, or whether it even relates to any aspect of the game. Part of me really wants to go back for completion, but I get the feeling it won\\'t be worth it by the time I\\'m back in the last part of the castle.\\nI wanted to get more immersed in this world than I was, and I wasn\\'t the only problem. NPCs, once they fulfilled their role in the story, gave the same old lines, over and over again, regardless of what had changed. Someone telling me to go visit this person (after I\\'d already visited them) breaks my immersion.\\n\\nDespite all my complaints, I enjoyed it. As I said, it\\'s solid when it comes down to platforming and combat. Platforming was never too difficult (annoying flying enemies and continuous aside), bosses and enemies were varied and interesting, the world is absolutely stunning, the OST stands alone, and it only takes an afternoon to complete from start to finish.\\n\\nLast nitpicks: \\nWhy was water an instakill in some places when my character can quite clearly swim in underwater sections? I thought maybe \\'poison/curse water\\', and while it\\'s true the two bodies of water don\\'t connect on the same screen, they\\'re clearly all part of the cursed town...\\nIf you\\'re a witch who can warp away, why warp out of battle once, only to be shocked at your own death the second?\\nIn a Metroidvania, where the character goes back and forth a lot, enemies should constantly be expecting you - not have their back turned blindly because you originally entered from the other direction. (Don\\'t get me wrong, I abused this like crazy, but it feels a bit unfair.)\\n\\nI\\'m sorry for killing the spider when I went back to the forest. :\\'( Simply excellent. Beautiful artwork, tight controls, interesting world to explore, has some soulsborne vibes in it, enjoyable, satisfying.\\n\\nThe world is nonlinear, doesn\\'t hold your hand, items and shortcuts to be found all over the map, reasons to backtrack to discover something new, maybe something you missed or forgot about. Definitely has secrets to discover! A great game with the feel of classic castlevania/metroid crossed with a little dark souls. NOW CONTAINS 100% PLAYTHROUGH WITH BAD END.\\n\\nI really hoped that my point of view would\\'ve changed with time. I thought that adding more story and complexity could\\'ve worked out good for this game, and it did. Since the previous Momodoras were lacking only these. Although covering up this hole, digged up another hole. This time immeasurable for me. This game is completelly diffrent from her older sisters.\\n\\nAt first everyone will notice that this Momodora is rather silent, it gives straight feeling that our adventure wont be happy this time. Ambients and low vibes of enviroment are the only sounds to be expected for quite a bit, this game is not energetic anymore. Unlucky for you if you want to play hard mode for bigger challenge, you will get frustrated by this \"silent aspect\" rather quickly. You die in 3 hits on hard and each section demand precision then, as a result ambients only frustrate you, because they make you more nervous instead of relaxing you. That was not a problem before. Conecting to this mood Momodora was usually cheerful, this time it is sad and sends only chill with melancholy down your spine. Each character you will meet along is giving you more of these negative emotions, they are desperate without hope, meanwhile others just becoming mad and posessed.\\n\\nI am cursing a lot during sessions with this game. Especially further in the game with RNG Water Bats which are going to be my worst nightmare from this game... popping out randomly from screen sides sometimes making me unable to leave section. Niiiice, death spikes are annoying. Save points are rare, thats good. Enemies are variant and sometimes surprising, but difficulty is not nicely balanced. Saying shortly - hitboxes. Few things are killing instantly few taking half of your hp sometimes, activating immortal mode is fun by taking hits from stepping into enemies it works great with bosses but not with other things RNG as hell. Attack from behind insta death. Boss patterns half RNG you cant predict what skill order they will use mostly. It is better to rush them. Final Bosses are damn dissapoitment, they have slow patterns without RNG.\\n\\n ~~\\nI finished whole game and I feel nothing. Its prolly because of bad end which was explained in 2 sentences, kicking me out to menu. I dont get it was that suppose to motivate? I will clean the map for 100% prolly with solution since this does not explain anything. Play time 7 Hours.\\n\\nSumming up I still like the game dont get me wrong. Its mysterious and you want to know more. You want to be that priestess in Game World who still has hope for saving everyone. I am being intrigued but not satisfied anymore by getting through the Game World even if it is still beautiful. Soundtrack lost energy and magic, and that is killing my joy not the difficulty I\\'ve chosen. BTW Still no swimming animations *smile*. This game hits all my Castlevania, Metroid and Dark Souls spots. I love it to bits and am now in the Insane difficulty playing through it again.\\n\\nIf you are a fan of one or all three of the mentioned games you will LOVE this one. Its gameplay reminds me a lot of Metroid. The graphics and bossfights are a lot like Castlevania (in terms of fighting). And your fightingstyle + healing and skills reminds me a lot of Dark Souls and Metroid.\\n\\nIt takes elements from 3 amazing games and mixes them and what comes out is a pure gem. A good sidescroller just like in the old days. But dont think that it is just as easy.\\n\\nThe game is rather hard, no matter how you look at it. Not knowing anything about the game I went in and died 7 times on the second screen which was still the tutorial. And the bosses themself are something as well. It takes a while for you to figure out how to properly fight them and even then, they can trick you.\\n\\nFor its price its a perfect experience and I encourage everyone to buy it. I like it. This game right here....\\nSmooth, accurate and fun. It definately has a Demon Souls feel to it which is great, if you like to curse out loud.\\nI currently have it on hard which I only recommend if you are an absolute masochist. Put Dark Souls and Super Metroid in a blender and you got this beauty of love and joy.\\n\\nThe game works perfectly with a pad like the good ol\\' days Really mixed feelings towards this game. Its so gorgeous, the animations are so pretty, the leaf attacking idea is just so amazing and so cute. The FX are also cute as fuck.\\n\\nBut the game design is really really bad. The normal dificulty is too easy, I can kill the bosses by couching and spam-arrowing. I ain\\'t even learning their moves.  Ok so I should move to the hard difficulty. But the hard difficulty is not smarter enemies, is just stronger hp and atk enemies, with one-hit-kill. The hard difficulty bottoms to just memorizing and practicing. Also the feeling of emptyness im this os overwhelming. Every part of it seems the same dark scenario. The game feels warm... not engaging.\\n\\nThis game has much to learn from Castle in the darkness. That was a true gem. The sound also helped a lot building the joyness. It looked like a true adventure.\\n\\nI really don\\'t know exactly what makes a game transcend from your regular everyday normal game to a metal gear solid, or a undertale, or a castle in the darkness, those has a real catch to it.\\n\\nBut momodora, brothers: tale of two sons, woofle, outland.. its just a regular sameness since the very beginning.\\n\\nBut I think it might be quite random, its impossible to build that specific feeling, you just have to keep trying.\\n\\nUntil momodora 5! Maybe reseting the franchise may bring new airs. Good luck! Amazing pixel art and animation! This is a very well designed metroidvania with great feeling combat.  The game feels very polished in every way. Large map to explore, exciting boss fights, beautiful art and a fantastic piano soundtrack. You can sense the developers dedication,passion and craft through every part of this game. Highly recommended! As someone who never writes reviews I just had to say this is a stellar game in a series that I\\'ve never even heard of until now. The controls are tight, the art and animations are wonderful, and the gameplay is fun. The game is a perfect mix of punishing for trying to bully your way ahead and rewarding for overcoming the challenges it puts in front of you. If you\\'re a fan of Dark Souls, Castlevania, Cave Story, or all three it\\'s definitely worth trying. This is not a long game, but it is a good game. The music is good, the art style appealing and the gameplay is fun and challenging.\\n\\nI mainly bought this game because you can turn into a cat, but it has more than just that. Great little gem. Fun combat system, real easy to master. Looks gorgeous. \\n\\nSaying all this, I think the game coulda been sooooo much more. \\n\\n Despite some missteps, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an easily recommendable game for your 2D Metroidvania-esque kick.\\n\\nIn case you didn\\'t notice that in the trailers, the game looks amazing. The quality of the pixel art is one of the reasons why I become interested in the first place, but after playing the game I can easily confirm that artstyle, atmosphere, ambient music and overall presentation holds the bar pretty high thought the whole game with no major complains. Sprites are big, expressive and detailed (really loving the enemy designs!) and most environments are extremely polished as well. Decay and corruption is the name of the game here and It\\'s realized masterfully by drab but beautiful locations and grim sound effects.\\n\\nYou can see that lots of thought went into level design. While the world isn\\'t as big as in other games from the genre, it is planned very carefully. Interconnection of many areas allows for a quite a bit of freedom in tackling several areas in middle-game. Platforming challenges are also present, but they are tactful and not extremely demanding, so high skill isn’t required. Still, I would like to see some of the instant death spikes removed in few places. Those aren\\'t viciously placed in particular but they are noticeable. There aren’t many upgrades and collectibles in comparison to other metroidvanias, but the gameplay is still well paced and there are few trinkets to collect. I need to mention a intuitive and non-annoying map and menus. \\n\\nCombat is competent but very basic. You are given some melee attacks, dodges and ranged arrows, but I think that basic three-hit combo could use some company in form of few other melee moves and tactics. This isn\\'t near being a deal breaker, since enemy encounters and especially bossfights, for what they are, present high excitement and pattern-reaction dodging action, which I really liked despite combat’s limitations. Still, there is a room for improvement.\\n\\nThe most glaring, wasted opportunity of the game is it’s story. This game is a prequel to the previous installments and it is implied that you don\\'t need to know any events from previous Momodora titles to enjoy it. While this is technically true and story isn\\'t nowhere near bad by itself, I\\'m afraid that game failed in giving enough lore and exposition for the new players. Fortunately, setup of the game is clear and you won\\'t roam aimlessly not knowing what to do, but the game really could use some more flavor text in many places. Game sometimes takes benefit or you not knowing the basics of Monomora\\'s lore, especially in the interesting ending sequence, but otherwise you would really like to know more about the world and characters. Worst offenders of exposition drought are the boss characters that appear and disappear without much explanation about their goals and whereabouts. Your opponents look like really interesting characters, but they aren\\'t fleshed out, set up properly or they often leave the scene in undisclosed fashion. I would really like to squeeze more out of the game’s story, for example by NPCs changing their dialog depending on the plot events or optional story-driven locations.\\n\\nWhile you can beat the game in 4 hours on your first try, it is ultimately satisfying adventure worth the asking price. There is a clear incentive of New Game+ mode and achievement encouraged challenges, so there is some replayability to the game after the initial run. I like to judge games based on the condition \"Would I really like to replay the game again after finishing it\". In that case, I can easily recommend this game. While flawed, it’s a wonderful little title with great presentation and honest effort. I really wish that dev will use experience from making this game as a base for new subsequent releases. This game feels like the lovechild of Dark Souls and Symphony of the Night. Loved every minute of it. I was left wanting more without the game feeling too short.\\n\\nI\\'d highly recommend this game. Oh... what a game. This is somewhere at the top of the list for me. Not sure where because I\\'ve played too many games but... yeah still there. This actually tops many classic platformers.\\n\\nI beat the game on hard mode so, if you\\'re wondering what difficulty to choose: it\\'s pretty brutal. You can get one-shotted in a couple of spots in the game (by definitely not one-shottable enemies). Be ready if you\\'re going to take on the challenge, like I did.\\n\\nThis game is amazing. Excellent atmosphere. Excellent gameplay. Classic.\\n\\nNot like Dark Souls (someone else said that).\\n\\nGet it. This game totally lives up to its title of \"The Dark Souls of 2d pixel platformers\". The level designs and boss battles are great, and the art and animations are gorgeous. This game has it all for action adventure fans. Tight controls, solid character progression, a fun world to explore and a relentless cast of enemies ready to cut you down. All bundled in a nice bitesize package. Don\\'t pass it up! This game is extremely good. There are enough secrets to sink many hours into, and the insane difficulty is aptly named. The bosses are difficult and have patterns that need to be learned. The few extra characters that appear in the map are not highly developed, but still intresting. All in all a very solid metroidvania game. Out of all the games to come out this year, I would say so far this is the best. It plays amazingly well and while the easier modes are a bit too easy I would think, you can go for things like Insane Mode, or Pacifist, or both, and basically make it as challenging as you want it to be. I played Momodora III a few months ago, and rather liked it. I thought it was an overlooked gem, worth checking out, but probably not something you would lose sleep over missing out on. \\n\\nThis game, however, is without a doubt something I would be sad to miss.\\n\\nIt\\'s well-crafted, beautifully drawn, mechanically solid, and utterly captivating. Pretty good run and hit at things type game along the same lines as that game and the other one.  Momodora games are a work in progress and this is their greatest leap ahead, yet still has some things to hammer out like enemy placement and damage allocation if they want to be compared to how that Konami franchise [i] was [/i].   If they want this franchise to only be difficult platformers they finally nailed the control scheme down which was the only issue of the previous games. \\n\\nIt\\'s around 6 hours if you play normally and get 100% completion so the $10 pricetag is fine.  Suprisingly enough it\\'s the only indie title that isn\\'t ripping design cues right from another japanese game or busy being some tumblr pet project with SJWs or hipsters at the helm. \\n\\n[b]tl;dr[/b]\\nGameplay - 9/10\\nVisuals - 10/10\\nSound - 6/10 (ambient dunegon BGMs and snorefest boss themes)\\nStory - 8/10\\nOveral - 8/10\\n\\nGOTY 2016 Pretty Fun. I actually spent a huge chunk of my week trying to beat this game. Having played all 4 Momodora games, and after beating this one 3 times as of writing this review i have to say this one is now my all-time favorite. My favorite before this game was momodora 2 because of exploration alone. momodora 3 was a great title as it was closer to a megaman zero style of gameplay. But with all that said let’s talk about Reverie Under the Moonlight shall we?\\n\\n**NO SPOILERS**\\n\\n-Exploration/Environment/Details and Secrets-\\nBefore this game came out i was very worried that it would have the same fate as Momodora 3, a great game that ended too short, due to little exploration. I’m glad that the developers took note on this issue and greatly expanded the world of Momodora 4. if you played Castlevania symphony of the Night you\\'ll feel right at home with Momodora 4.This world is also filled with character puzzles to solve, Hidden passages, mini Quests which reward you with either a weapon upgrade or an item with an effect. This open world environment similar to symphony of the night is what the momodora series needed (momodora 2 comes pretty close though).\\n\\ngameplay/references/art style\\ni can\\'t help it but I’m getting the feeling that Momodora 4 borrowed some elements from BloodBorne (which is a good thing) . Even the first enemies in the game can still pose a threat if you don\\'t respect them enough (very similar to the soul’s games). When seeing the combat/dodging system in the trailer i felt like it was going to be a useless gimmick of the game... boy was i wrong! Similar to devil may cry, if you don\\'t figure out the boss/enemies attacks and you don\\'t dodge them right you will die... A LOT! As for references to other games i feel this game borrows elements from: bloodborne, Metroid, castlevania , and megaman zero. On that note I have to say I’m impressed by the way I found NO GLITCHES in the game so far and the mechanics of the game run solid and smooth.\\n\\nReplay value\\nThis game has great replay value! If you beat the game with a “good ending” the game gives you the option to replay it with most of the items you picked up but from the beginning of the game! This gives the player a great chance to help a character they might have missed or choose a different method of doing things.\\n\\nReligion?\\nLike it or not, this game is heavily religious based although it’s more of the “momodora religion” then something real. But this actually made me think “what would a priestess do?” as certain parts of the game had you choose in somewhat a religious manner. Being non-religious myself I had no problem with this element in the game.\\n\\n\\nEndings\\nLike other momodora titles you must achieve certain items by helping some characters (or if you find the item through hidden parts of the game) in order to get the True ending. This gives character design more importance and meaning as you take the time to understand each character and their specific needs.\\n\\n-Music-\\nThe music was great as always, I feel the music this time around tried hard to be bloodborne with a momodora sytle but that’s just my personal opinion. \\n\\nIn conclusion I have played many a game in my day and I have to say that this one is definitely a Triple A title! I feel this game was a great mile stone in the series and it will establish an even bigger fan base. I feel this 4th installment sets a new tone for the development team as before they were small and now they put a Big game out there and for many this is their first momodora game.\\n\\nI don’t rate games this high often but I have to say this game is easily a 9/10.\\nA damn good game!\\n 10/10, 10/10, 100/100 best game, best game\\n~Jontron Great gameplay, atmosphere, and art- I didn\\'t know I wanted to play Castlevania+Dark Souls until I became engrossed with this game. A pretty awesome pocket Metroidvania, great difficulty balance, great moveset and controls, lovely music and a sad but interesting setting. While I like the previous Momodora games this is a HUGE improvement. Recommended.\\n\\nAround four hours long on the first playthrough by the way. Worth the munny. Oh how I wish I had the skill to program a game this awesome.\\nBeautiful, cute, and smoooth. Such a great little package of a game. 1010 First of all I\\'d like to point out that I literally just bought the game roughly an hour ago (explains my hours on record). I saw this game being promoted on by Temmie Chang, an artist that has worked on Undertale, so I figured hey this might be good. After seeing the trailer I immediately saved up to buy it ASAP.\\n\\nAfter installation and booting up I was greeted by this pixel wonder menu screen and mesmerizing music but... yeah.. Things go a little bit awry when I tried to configure the controls because there\\'s none. I mean sure I could switch from 3 control schemes but that\\'s about it. Admittingly I don\\'t own an Xbox 360 controller or any sort of controller (I should get one) so that crosses out the controller schemes out the window.\\n\\nI looked at the button setup for the keyboard since it\\'s the only choice I have and I was kinda disappointed because I cannot change the bindings. YES THAT\\'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BINDINGS. Not that it\\'s a major thing that will affect the entire experience though.\\n\\nI started a new game and everything reminded me of my castlevanias, and that was the magic charm I was expecting to come along this game. The character controls fluidly and tight, an important factor for games like this. She has weight to her movement which is great because it synergizes with the responsive butter smooth controls. The hitbox is sweet and precise and you can feel the great force of every attack you try to land.\\n\\nGraphics wise it\\'s reminiscent of ye old retro pixels which is one of the reasons why I bought this game (and due to hardware limitations). Everything is done with heart from the character animation to the little tid bits that happen in the background. I have no complaint with the overall art style and presentation. Pure bliss.\\n\\nThe music is superb. It reminds me of the good old days of the SNES. Not much to say.\\n\\nMy only gripe about the game so far is the inability to change the keyboard bindings. It\\'s a personal thing of mine to tinker with the config and adjust the controls to my taste. I frankly found it confusing when I was engaging in battle as I try my best to press the jump button only to keep slashing the air with my maple leaf blade. Although I am not giving this game a thumbs down just because of that. The game was released just a few days ago so I don\\'t blame the devs for that but please do hear me out and add in an option wherein we can change the bindings.\\n\\nThis is a fantastic game and my first Momodora game to boot. Cheers. Fairly short but sweet, with familiar elements, and the atmosphere and music to tie it all together. Although a bit depressing at times, gorgeous graphics and music. Loved every second of it.\\nMany difficulty settings from casual to a real challenge! [b]In Short:[/b] Great gameplay, Levels, enemies, secrets and items - Poor sound design and Story.\\n\\nA very enjoyable game. If you enjoy Platformers or Darksouls type games, I highly reccomend this title.\\n\\nVery fun gameplay and combat, able to stand up as a great game with that alone. \\nBeautiful art and interesting level design, You can easily back-track when you need to and frequently open shortcuts.\\nA large array of different items and secrets that you wont find on your first playthough.\\n\\nThe biggest issue with the game is poor sound design. Many of the sounds fit, but feel off. And some just seem plain broken (Such as when you deflect a throwing knife)\\n\\nThe Story was also not too compelling but didnt seem to matter too much. Loved it,\\nThe visual art of this game is just too damn good.\\nAnd don\\'t get me started on the soundtrack and gameplay!\\n\\nSuch a brilliant addition to a great genre.\\n Amazing game, just the right amount of difficult.  Fun boss fights and lots of exploring.  A metroidvania/dark souls feel for sure.\\nFinished the game with \"True Ending\" in just about 6 hours. It\\'s Metroidvania Dark Souls, and it\\'s really good. Super fun metroidvania game - lots of secrets, fun bosses, tons of items, and a good ost.  \\nVery challenging on higher difficulties (would definitely recommend normal on your first playthrough).\\nMy only complaint is that I wish it had a couple more areas (there are only about 6), but that\\'s just cause I didn\\'t want it to end. Very fun game. The game length feels just right, with a 100% playthrough on hard taking me around 4 hours. Combat is simple in a good way. You have a 3 hit ground combo, an air hit, arrows, and a roll that you\\'re invincible in. The difficulty in combat comes from timing and knowing when to dodge attacks. Items allow for some customization in your playstyle, and the variety in them is great. The game gives some nice freedom in the beginning, allowing you to visit locations and fight most of the bosses in any order before the final two ares (unreachable until you get 4 crests by beating the bosses).\\n\\nSpeaking of bosses, the boss fights are great. Almost all attacks the bosses have are telegraphed before they come out, making it feel fair whenever you receive damage. Most of the bosses are pretty unique battles too, so there\\'s some nice variance in those fights (though there is one repeated boss battle).\\n\\nStory is... relatively light. Characters come and go rather quickly while not saying much, and the story itself is rather predictable. I\\'d say that\\'s the weakest part but it is by no mean bad, just not as fleshed out as I\\'d like. The ambience is great too, most of the game has a very grim atmosphere to it. Easily recommendable, very fun, worth the money. The combat system is so cool, judging by the game\\'s graphics I didn\\'t think fighting could be this challenging and unique. An amazing piece of art for lnly $10 Bought the game at full price at launch, and I can\\'t even be mad that it went on sale.\\n\\nAwesome pixel-art graphics, challenging bosses (with rewards for actually playing well against them/not taking damage in the form of power up items for your character), open-ended exploration, great atmosphere, appropriately sparse and well-composed soundtrack never feels intrusive, absolutely amazing game. Seems designed for speedrunning and challenge playthoughs (i.e. pacifist runs, multiple difficulties etc.) Long enough to feel satisfying and short enough that it doesn\\'t overstay it\\'s welcome. Buy it now and thank me later Wow, this game came out of nowhere! This game is fantastic blend of lots of elements. It\\'s a Metroidvania style game with a lovely art style, it reminds me a little bit of Monster World IV. The game is also quite challenging, but if you get a little stuck you can always do some exploration until you feel ready to brave whatever area got you stuck. I got stuck on a particular boss but I went off into areas of the map I had not yet discovered until I got a few more powerups and items to help me overcome the challenge.\\n\\nLovely art, controls like a dream, music is very well done... and definitely worth the price of admission! Fight with your strangely powerful leaf the overcome this dark, yet also vibrant land of foes out to kill you.This is a 2d action adventure game with elements taken right out of the Souls series, Metroid, and Castlevania. Video review of the indie game Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight... \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5cRHEIUq-0&index=6&list=PLkWo_cgaAOB80SHcDpCWBPgeAjfdroE8r&t=35s This is a solid, perfect example of what a Metroidvania style game should strive towards. Plenty of different paths await you that you can take to find your way towards the next area. The game rewards your exploration - numerous times, I would explore and find bonus items, some of which being able to be used to go and unlock other things from previous levels. The combat is really enjoyable, with each boss being challenging, albeit doable. \\n\\nThe graphics are beautiful. There\\'s no doubt about it, this is one of the prettiest games I\\'ve seen in a long while, and the aesthetics blend into the music perfectly. My favourite area, Whiteleaf Memorial Park, was serene and beautiful, and the music... this is a game that I could just have open and listen to for hours and hours.\\n\\nThe game is challenging - it isn\\'t all THAT hard (though keep in mind I played on Normal difficulty, I\\'ll do a Hard run soon) but some bosses can and WILL hold you up for a while. The bosses are quite charming with their variety and they definitely are quite fun to fight against, as well - you have massive witch ladies to a knight/archer duo, everything giving its utmost to take you down.\\n\\nThe story isn\\'t anything special, but it doesnt need to be. You\\'re a priestess on her way through the land to stop the spread of a taint that has reached your homeland, and that\\'s all there is too it. It\\'s very simplistic, but it plays well into the setting and allows for some fun creativity in abilities that you can use to sprint and dodge your way through the Kingdom of Karst.\\n\\nShould you buy this game? Yes, without a doubt. It\\'s worth every single penny. If you mix up some of the mechanics from the Dark Souls games and mix them with Metroidvania you\\'ll get something like this. The pixelated graphics are endearing and has a lot of detail. If you enjoy the genre there\\'s a lot to like here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20F_cM-KgrU It one of the amazing game out  there\\nThe reasons.\\n1- Awesome fight play.\\n2- Big diversity of enemies.\\n3-The places look great and look a life.\\n4-Nice story .\\n5-The game reward you for. Research and exploration for secrets.\\n\\tThanks .\\n Some game design flaws.\\nThis is like playing souls... without any idea of when monster are going to hit you, almost no healing items, unfair situations etc etc etc\\n\\nLevels are pretty short.\\n\\nArtstyle is ok, but the game runs at a 4:3 ratio.\\nMusic is ok, with some tracks better than others, but most of the time I\\'ve played, the game was dead silent... The Momodora series has a quality and care about it that sets it apart from many games of its ilk. The newest game in the series is a beautiful piece of work in every one of its qualities (the gameplay mechanics, the backgrounds, and the characters and world lore). $10 is worth it for anyone, but if you\\'re a fan of Castlevania it\\'s absolutely priceless. ever wanted darksouls with cavestory art style\\nlook no farther. When people described this as having elements of Castlevania and Dark Souls, I was instantly sold and I’m glad I was. What I discovered was a highly original title with familiar elements, making for one awesome game. The combat is fluid and on point, the atmosphere and music are intense throughout and the graphics are stunning with some amazing animation. A single play through will probably last 4-6 hours depending on how you play but there are multiple difficulties and new game + to add some extra replay value. It is certainly a short and sweet experience, but it left me wanting more. Gorgeous game, fun metroidvania with a few secrets to find, sad that its so short and suffers from frame drops here and there, still, probably the best game in the series, worth its price and includes ng+. This is a really amazing game. I bought it because the charming graphics in the trailer attracted me and I couldn\\'t be more satisfied. The graphics and animations are so charming and beautiful I can\\'t get enough of it. The combat is very fun and each strike feels weighty. The rolling mechanic feels very responsive and feels amazing to use to go behind enemies. The soundtracks are good and atmospheric, though weirdly enough the first area has no bgm and instead only have an ambience that is looped not very well. The bosses are challenging enough and identifying their patterns really feels great. There are a bunch of equippable items with varying effects that you use depending on the situation. \\n\\nOverall a very great, though short game. It\\'s still worth the price if you like platformers though. Makes for a nice weekend fun gaming session. The various challenge runs can also potentially add to the playtime if you\\'re up for it. This game has an amazing atmosphere, beautiful environments, and a very nice soundtrack. The gameplay itself is very, very challenging, but incredibly fun and rewarding. Little details really bring the world to life, and the pixel art is gorgeous. \\n\\nAlthough there are not many characters and some of them do not get developed very much, you certainly get attached to them during the course of the game. The heroine, despite being silent, has a personality you can ascertain from your journey with her, and even the idle animations give her character. \\n\\nDepending on how good you are, the main game should take you about 4 hours, but the NG+ will likely provide you with even more enjoyment. Although I found it short, I am ultimately very satisfied with the experience. This is one of the best action platformers I have played in a long, long time, and it will certainly leave a lasting impression on me. \\n\\nAs a prequel, there are more games in this series to play, but I myself am unsure if the other games will be able to fill the void in my heart that has formed after finishing this game. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everybody, although fans of action platformers will likely enjoy it the most. Let me start off by saying, I havent played the previous three games in this series but that didnt really effect the game other than some easter-eggs i didn\\'t understand. From the perspective of a guy who likes platformers a lot, this one gets the B+. The art of style aside, it plays very well. On hard, it is challenging, but not to the point you get mad at the game. The patterns are pretty clear cut which makes no part of the game feel \"impossible,\" each time you do the same thing you get a little better. Now the art, 10/10, thats all I have to say, even the idle animation of the yawning looks great. First time I played through I didn\\'t get the \"true ending\" which felt... not good. So I played it through again, got 99% map coverage and did the final battle again, and got the good ending, which felt pretty darn good.But this is why it didnt get the A; Story didn\\'t blow my mind, and I wouldn\\'t play it through again any time soon, but I would come back eventually. It was something simple and predictable but enjoyable, especially that fight in the monestary, by far best part of the game. The piano music when she turns her head was really the Royal Flush of moments. In conclusion Lubella\\'s rack, 10/10... and, I\\'m glad I bought the game. Worth every penny, a great game I picked up at a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Bad Moon Rising\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight wasn\\'t just my mildly successful Creedence Clearwater Revival cover band – it\\'s the fourth entry in the Momodora series... a series I did not know existed until, like, this one. It\\'s also, for my money, an early indie GOTY contender. Between its awesome and varied settings and backdrops, its weighty combat and epic boss fights, its minimalistic story and sweeping soundtrack, its secrets and challenges, you might be mistaken in thinking this is 2D Dark Souls. \\n\\nIt is not.\\n\\nIn fact, aesthetically and story-wise, it feels like it takes a lot of welcome cues from Bloodborne. \\n\\nStory is pretty standard: you\\'re a young priestess who\\'s idyllic, Shire-y land is positively swamped with curse juices bubbling up from the big city (where all curses begin). She sets out to expel the evil with naught but her bow, her arrows, and a comically large maple leaf.\\n\\nAlong the way she\\'ll talk to NPCs for some world building, purchase items from vendors none-too-perturbed by the whole doomsday curse situation, find secrets (some well hidden, some requiring backtracking once you get the necessary item/ability a la Medroidvanias), and defeat a variety  of baddies and bosses. \\n\\nCombat is... visceral? But it\\'s pretty basic. Land a few blows, dodge, heal or boost your attack, rinse and repeat. Learning the patterns is half the thrilling battle, and each boss has its own style. Some are small and quick, some are massive with equally large AOE attacks. Nothing felt gimmicky, and there were no “puzzle” bosses for better or worse... well, maybe ONE boss would constitute as a puzzle but I\\'d rather not spoil that.\\n\\nEach area of the world has a distinct flavor: there\\'s a sunken graveyard full of debris and sea creatures, a gothic city basking in a red moon\\'s glow, a picturesque forest, and much more. There was a “fire” world that left a lot to be desired but for roughly 90% of the game I was impressed at the scope and beauty of the world Bombservice crafted. \\n\\nIt\\'s just a great little game... took me about six hours to complete and I only have one achievement to show for it – lots of secrets and challenges for the achievement hounds among us. Momodora is not one to overlook, and I can\\'t think of a single issue, not even a minor one.\\n\\nNot even some minor niggle. \\n\\nIt\\'s just that good, and well worth a full price purchase. \\n\\n...\\n\\nAnd you can turn into a cat! That\\'s priceless.  How many games let you turn into an adorable cat? If you liked games like the handheld Castlevania ones and Symphony of the Night in paticular you will feel right at home with this one even though it has its own unique style. Although it is rather short this game is very enjoyable and has a New Game + mode as well I do think its worth the price and the spritework is really good as well as the feel and the enviroments of the game overall.\\n\\nI managed to finish the game and get pretty much all the secrets in under 5 hours so I do wish it was longer cause I loved it but I saw some reviews of people that took around 8 hours to beat it so maybe I\\'m just really good at this after playing so many metroidvania titles. If you have the money I say check it out its alot of fun. Absolutely beautiful environments and characters. Animations are wonderfully smooth as well! Gameplay is fun, albeit challenging. Truly the Dark Souls of 2D Metroidvanias, in a good way! :D nice ! Wow, was not expecting anything this good. I have been looking for a game like this for some time, it reminds me of bloodborne with creepy creature design, tough as nails combat, and controls that are tighter than a drum. I have to give a shout out to the devs for making a game that is predominately populated by females. This is even more impressive given that they have managed to eschew the typical oversexualization common in the genre, (Yes, there is a battle with a giant woman\\'s breasts, but it isn\\'t fetishized the way that many developers would play it.) it\\'s a fun game with unique combat hat I won\\'t spoil further. Enjoy! Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (\"Momodora 4\") is a hard, unforgiving but rewarding 2D metroidvania.\\nEverything you loved about Momodora III but with beautiful character animations, Blood Borne looking setting, better music and an interesting combat system. If you like Cave Story and/or Demons/Dark Souls you\\'ll love this game.\\nTook me about 5 hours to complete on normal, 7~8 to find all(?) secrets. After playing the previous Momodora games and reading comments about the length, I was really wary at purchasing this game. Someone in the forum even said they beat the game in \"2 hours\". Momodora III was fun but VERY short, so I wasn\\'t sure if this one was worth the price tag.\\n\\nI\\'m so glad I decided to buy this game, and anyone who \"beat\" this game in 2 hours is either cheating (has a map/watching playthrough) or they\\'re not playing it right (playing on easy and blowing through it).\\n\\nIf you are a fan of challenging, old-school platformers, or even a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, don\\'t hesitate! Get this game, put it on hard, prepare to die and have a blast while doing it.\\n\\nLike Souls, you will learn enemy locations and attack patterns, enemies always spawn in the same place. But one or two wrong moves and you\\'re dead (on hard), it\\'s back to the last checkpoint (these are far more plenty than similar games, plus you have healing items). The game never feels cheap and deaths are almost always due to a poor move on my part.\\n\\nIf you play the game the way it\\'s meant to be played, a brutal RPG platformer, you\\'ll get much more than a few hours of enjoyment from it. My first playthrough was around 6 hours, and then there\\'s a new game +, for me replay value is high. There\\'s plenty of collectibles and secrets and I want them all. If you\\'re not into that, replaying the new game + is still fun and challenging.\\n\\nDo I wish it was longer? Totally! I would love some DLC with extra levels, characters or power ups (and I\\'d happily pay more for it too). But what is here is definitely worth the $9-10. I\\'ve spent $20 bucks on shorter indie games that weren\\'t nearly as fun (I\\'m looking at you Firewatch), or that were good but had no replay value. \\n\\nBefore I wrap this up, it\\'s not perfect either. There are some things that bother me about the game:\\nScreen-tearing. \\nI read the forums and there are a few suggestions that I need to try to fix it, but as it is there is some screen-tearing on my computer. This is a 2D pixel platformer that\\'s not even widescreen, it should run silky smooth on my computer that can run most new games on high settings.  \\nWhich brings me to: Not widescreen. \\nIt\\'s 2016, and while I enjoy the SNES nostalgia of an old, square screenspace, I feel like all games should at least have a widescreen option these days. Wasted screenspace in a game as beautiful as this one is just disappointing.    \\nMoving while you attack. \\nThis bugs me. In Momodora III, when you attack, you remain in place. In this installment, you move forward as you attack. This creates problems when you\\'re attacking an enemy and then all the sudden you\\'re on top of them and you take damage. I think the melee from Momodora III was superior. This is a small complaint though and I still enjoy the game thoroughly. It\\'s also a far superior game to the other Momodora\\'s in other aspects such as graphics, playtime, the dodge and arrow system, ect. \\n\\nDo I recommend this game? HELL YES. Grab your Maple Leaf and get ready to put the smackdown on some demonic baddies. Great gameplay, gorgeous art, powerful music... Momodora III was a cool game but this is on another level entirely.\\n\\nWhat particularly striked me is the attention to details (in animations, backgrounds and other things) despite the pixel style. You can tell they really cared about polishing every aspect of the game. \\n\\nThe plot is minimalistic but the storytelling of the game goes beyond the (actually well written) few interactions with the characters, and seems to build mostly from the atmosphere of the various environments you explore. Also from a lot of details as I mentioned above (something as simple as the animation the character does when presenting herself tells a lot about her personality, for example).\\n\\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned, the various movement techs + strategies required (particularly in higher difficulties) make it pretty interesting and challenging. Good enough to be considered seriously for speedrunning.\\n\\nThe only thing I\\'m slightly reserved about is the enemy balance which could have been better imo. When playing in Insane, some of the early areas turn out to be the hardest because some early enemies are maddening. On the other hand, the final boss turns out to be relatively easy with a few dull phases.\\n\\nThat\\'s relatively minor concerns though and I highly recommend the game. game is a great challenging game recomend buy This game is a fairly straight forward Metroidvania that seems to draw inspiration from the Souls games, or more specifically Bloodborne. The combat is solid and really clicks once you\\'ve learned the rhythm of it. It has a fairly deep inventory system with interchangable items that have passive or active status effects.  Playing with combinations of these items can help alter your approach to tackling a difficult boss or section of enemies and makes it so you never feel like you\\'re banging your head against a wall. The art direction is great and it has an amazing soundtrack that is varied and immersive. Overall great game and in my opinion one of the better indie metroidvanias out there. If you aren\\'t convinced yet by the other reviews that this game is damn good, well, here\\'s mine.\\n\\n[i]Momodora: RUtM[/i] is an action platformer/metroidvania style game and is the fourth game of the Momodora series. Looking back on the still excellent Momodora III, it would be hard to believe that [i]RUtM[/i] is improved in nearly every aspect. But it is. You don\\'t have to have played Momodora III to understand the story because [i]RUtM[/i] is the prequel to the series. Here\\'s the backstory of the game (without spoilers, of course):\\n\\nThe story is about Kaho, a priestress from the village of Lun. As a curse spreads through the lands, she gets sent to the source of the corruption: the city of Karst that appears to be now under the reign of an undead witch. Kaho\\'s mission is to seal the curse away.\\n\\nThere are three difficulty levels plus one that unlocks if you finish the game on hard, I think. Even on normal difficulty it\\'s hard as hell at some points [spoiler](I\\'m looking at you Pardoner Fennel)[/spoiler]. Anyways the boss fights are overall intese but never unfair and also very fun. You need to see through their attack patterns and use your skill to dodge and counter attack. If you just go berserk on your enemies you\\'re as good as dead. \\n\\nIn comparison to the prequel, the graphics have been greatly improved. The sprites are now larger which allows more detail but the devs still manage to stick to the series\\' retro style. The artworks, pixel art and animations are just beautiful. On top of that there are even reflections on the water and the light effects look great. Many little details, like the waving grass, make the game very atmospheric. Except of the starting area which is a lush forest, [i]RUtM[/i]\\'s setting is mostly dark and gloomy which adds to the intense atmosphere. The music finally complements the atmosphere. In fact the music is great. For the first time ever I even bought the OST.\\n\\n[i]RUtM[/i] is a relatively short game but it offers a great replayability. It took me approximately 5 to 6 hours to complete with 100% collectables. But to get all achievements, you have to finish it 3 or 4 times.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\nOne of the best (or even [b]the[/b] best?) metroidvania style games on Steam. In my oppinion it\\'s on the same level as classic Castlevania games. Very atmospheric, nice boss fights. For only 9,99€ (USD $9.99) it is definitely a must-have. just a great game, simple controls. amazing what you can do when your in the zone. if you like mario, super ghost and goblins and kirby then this will feel right at home, though a bit on the tough side.\\n\\n8/10\\nexectued really well.\\n I played all the way through Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight on my first sit. I came back twice so far, and I might keep coming a couple more times. Without knowing anything about the creators or the series, I saw the trailer and I was enthraled by the fast-paced action and fluid animation. I quickly gave in and was excited to begin.\\n\\nAs soon as you enter you are in control of all the maneuvers you will use during the game. As you walk across the first set of rooms, a quick exposition teaches you all you need to know from the start to the last room of the game: jump higher, jump through thin ledges, roll past enemies, dodge attacks, use quick items, etc.\\n\\nThere are no pletora of weapons or intricate stats to level up and manage. On a checkpoint, you regain health and your items restock. So you don\\'t have to exploit arbitrary stats or weaknesses. It\\'s just you, your bow and your magic leaf.\\n\\nEven as you get close to the end, the enemies don\\'t become sponges. The challenge is made by careful enemy placement, traps, and high-stakes combat. The latter is specially true during boss fights. Throwing yourself head first during a boss fight always results in an abrupt death. Boss fights are lengthy battles of endurance and agility where the user is expected to anticipate and counteract every move.\\n\\nThe setting is a large, cleverly interconnected map. The rooms react to your passing and things waft freely, giving them a living and breathing feel. As you navigate, you will open up shortcuts, battle your way through to key items and upgrades and open up secret paths. Eventually, a single mid-game upgrade will prompt you to backtrack to previously non-accessible spots, but on the upside you quickly attain the ability to warp between checkpoints.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is tense and moody and it helps convey the overall gloomy and cold setting as much as the environment design does.\\n\\nOverall, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight feels like the product of many iterations on the action platformer idea, because it is clearly a highly refined experience. Hopefully the creators intend to push forward with the concept, even if it is on a completely new setting, because I\\'ll be looking forward to their next instalment, Just did a runthrough of the game, 100% on Normal. Now here are my thoughts. Just a disclaimer though -- I am not a long time fan of the series, in fact this is the first I\\'d ever heard of Momodora, and thus I have only played this one.\\n\\nIf you want to know what you\\'re getting, just look at the trailer, cause what you see is generally what you get; it does an excellent job of summarizing what to expect. But the about section definitely seems to oversell just what it can deliver in my opinion.\\n\\nGraphics/Artwork: Excellent style. The art style is similar in spirit to Cave Story, only not having as rigid of restrictions on sprite definition, resolution, and colors. I\\'d say that the artwork attempted to portray their vision using graphics that are as minimalistic as they could be without sacrificing the expression. The end result is very pleasing to the eye. Also, the character sprites (especially Kaho) are very expressive.\\n\\nGameplay: Don\\'t let anyone fool you -- the combat isn\\'t that intricate in this game. You\\'ve got chargeable ranged attacks and your melee attacks work out to just a generic three-hit-combo move. Apart from that you have roll-dodging and jumping (and later on, air dodging) as your evasive moves [strike]but the controls might wind up frustrating your attempts to take advantage of all of this at once.[/strike] Items generally take some time to use (and can be disrupted by attacks) so it\\'s foolish to use them when you\\'re at risk of being hit -- you need space to use them. Combat is still interesting though, but you might seriously consider just avoiding the more problematic enemies rather than fighting them.\\n\\nDifficulty: Oh man, this game is frustratingly hard... at the start. When you first start out, you don\\'t have many options at your disposal and the difficulty comes right out of the gates hard. Throughout the game bosses can be expected to deal a third of your health bar in damage. As you progress through the game though (assuming you explore a lot and hunt things down), the odds will swing drastically in your favor;  if you 100% the game, the final boss isn\\'t hard at all, so long as you remember to heal.\\n\\nControls: [i]When I did my first run of this game, keybindings could not be customized which I took great issue with, considering I found the default QWEASD layout for action keys to be cumbersome -- but it has since been patched so this is no longer an issue.[/i]\\nYou can use a gamepad, but you\\'re forced to use one of two preset configurations. This is bad for me since my USB gamepad\\'s buttons map to a rather strange layout. This kind of restriction only makes sense on console games, where the type of controller the player uses can be predicted.\\n\\nStory: It\\'s not as engrossing or involved as the description would have you believe, IMO. There is very little dialogue. Items can give hints towards some background of the setting, but there\\'s still a few unanswered questions (I wonder if playing the other games would make them make sense in context?). Clearly some thought went into the various NPCs and bosses of the game regarding their personalities, motives, and feelings... but in the end it only expresses itself in a handfull of dialogue. Really, though, that\\'s all that a game like this really needs. But I feel that \"compelling personalities\" is not something that can [i]quite[/i] describe the characters of the game... in how they are shown.\\nIt seems like there\\'s a lot we aren\\'t seeing. Stuff about the setting, the characters, and so on that\\'s still locked away in the creators\\' minds.\\n\\nMusic: It does a great job at expressing the atmosphere of areas and events. There\\'s honestly not much more I can say about it. One gripe I have though about games like these, is I\\'m getting sick of buying the soundtrack bundle only to find the game music is already there in the game\\'s data files, in easy-to-read .ogg format -- and I just paid $2 or so extra basically for album art and MP3 tags. Please, developers. Stop doing this. Stop trying to sell us something we already bought. If you try to sell the soundtrack my first assumption is that the audio files are packed, encrypted, or otherwise not accessible as easily as just opening the folder and double clicking on a tersely named .OGG file. I may just stop buying soundtrack DLC entirely if this keeps up.\\n\\nReplayability: There\\'s going back to collect anything you missed, NG+, and increasing difficulty levels. Enough to keep most people coming back a few times. And for true masochists you can always try minimal item runs.\\n\\nSo overall, we\\'re looking at this game, priced at base $10 US ($12-13 if you buy the soundtrack with it which I don\\'t reccomend, for the aforementioned reasons). So, to someone unfamiliar with the series... Is it worth the asking price?\\n\\nIf the gameplay trailer looks fun, I\\'d reccomend it, assuming you have no problem with punishing difficulty. If you have your doubts about the game from anything I\\'ve said here, I\\'d wait until it goes for 50% or more off. If you are prone to ragequitting, I\\'d not bother with the game at all.\\n\\nPersonally, I don\\'t regret having picked it up. I highly recommend that you use a widely accepted currency that is equal in value to approximately 10 US dollars to purchase the newly released electronic game Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight for the personal computer. A charming mix between a metroidvania and a platformer with some challenging boss fights.\\n\\nOne of the aspects I enjoyed the most, apart from the gameplay, were the idle animations for Kaho, our character. The yawning, tipping her shoes and all the other ones. The little details like the idle animations really added a lot of charm to this game and added a lot of charm to the silent main character.\\n\\nThe game isn\\'t too long but the New Game + mode unlocked at the end is sure to add even more hours. It took me a little more than 8 hours to complete my play-through since I went for a complete 100% map and secret items right on the first run, plus I got my behind handed to me by more than one boss.\\n\\nThe boss fights are challenging. Some more than others. I laughed the first time I got to fight the Witch boss.\\n\\nThe story is... OK. Nothing particularly great but it works well in establishing the setting, especially thanks to the conversations with the various NPCs present in the game and the way those are delivered.\\nI also liked how various events take place throughout our journey that could be easily missed without exploring a little and how certain choices can affect some of them.\\n\\nThis game was fully worth its price and I\\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a short but challenging metroidvania-lite game. A simple but wonderous game that took me completely by surprise. As the honest trailers and screenshots may indicate, this is a simple little Castlevania-inspired side scroller with some notable influences from other franchises, most clearly Megaman and Souls/Bloodborne. Gameplay feels tight and responsive with passive and active items allowing for a multitude of play styles, and the difficulty is unforgiving but fair, for the most part avoiding robbing you of large amounts of progress upon each death. The music and the charming visual design really bring together this great package, which is nothing short of a steal for its price, offering you a solid 5+ hour playthrough with some good reasons to replay. The Momodora franchise found itself a new fan in me with this game, and I wish it a successful future and more games like this one. soundtrack: 9/10\\ngameplay: 10/10\\n\\na bit short, but challenging and fun. best 8 bucks i\\'ve spent on steam in a loooooooong time My first Momodora game, and probably not the last. Challenging and enjoyable combat with the sense of wonderment and discovery that makes it, like everybody says, a mix between Castlevania and Dark Souls. Easily worth the asking price of ten dollars. The game is fun and the aesthetics are nice. There is a sort of visual shift after the first stage, its a good one.\\n\\nThe difficulty is pretty rough at first, but gets progressively more lenient if you gather all the good items and optional upgrades and secrets.\\n\\nAnd now the keyboard has custom assignable keys, so you can set it to whatever you\\'re comfortable with. Fluid action, great controls and atmosphere, a big world to explore, worth far more than the $9 asking price, buy it now! Before you react, read this: This review is OBSOLETE. I now recommend this game as a lot of things have been addressed. For preservation and \"I don\\'t want my ratings cleared\" reasons, I\\'m not switching it to a yes but my current opinion is now YES.\\n\\nNote: I\\'m a big Momodora fan. \\nNote 2: I got the True Ending on Medium.\\n\\nThis game is kinda a one step forward, two steps back deal. If you haven\\'t played Momodora 1, 2, and 3, here\\'s a quick background:\\n\\nMomodora is a series that follows a shrine maiden (or two) as she is sent to defeat an evil queen of ___ who is the source of a curse on their village by wrecking shit with a maple leaf. They are all platformers, and they all feature both a melee attack and a ranged attack. The first one was just a level based game, the second one (my favorite and imo the top of the series) was a metroidvania with permanent passive upgrades, and the third one featured two characters, a return to linear levels, and a new passive item management system.\\n\\nThis game is pretty much a mix of 2 and 3, with both passive permanent upgrades and additional charms you can equip for effects. It\\'s also a metroidvania, but the level design is more linear than 2.\\n\\nSo let\\'s talk about the goods and the bads.\\n\\nTheme: Unlike the other games that were a bit more chipper, this game is rather dark. Yes it has cats, yes it has cute one eyed demons, but everything else is death and misery. It\\'s a \"feel like crap\" ride until the end. If you\\'re looking for anything uplifting or cute, look elsewhere, since you won\\'t find it here.\\n\\nThe story is... honestly pretty eh. It doesn\\'t really do much to change the Momodora formula OTHER than make it darker, which just isn\\'t enough. I don\\'t really care about any of the chars and they don\\'t have as much personality despite them saying more. Really story has never been Momodora\\'s strong suite, and for some reason I felt like I cared even less about chars in this game than the other. Maybe it\\'s because in this one they were forced more, DevArt OC melodrama style. It just didn\\'t work. Even the evil queens in the other game seemed to have more personality, in this one I just didn\\'t feel anything as I was fighting her.\\n\\nGraphics: \\n\\nGorgeous. Nothing bad to say here. I liked the cute chibi chars of the other games but style wise I see why the artist wanted to move on. I only have one complaints: For some reason the devs decided to turn the lights off, Binding of Isaac Curse of Darkness style, for half the levels (there\\'s an item to get rid of this for a minute or so but it\\'s one use until you hit the next checkpoint.) It\\'s not even a spelunky \"shroud of blackness,\" it\\'s more like playing an original gameboy without a backlight. Either turn the brightness up on this game or you won\\'t be able to see a thing. Seriously.\\n\\nPlatforming:\\n\\nIt\\'s worse than the other games, honestly. Maybe it\\'s the bigger hitboxes, or maybe it\\'s the obsession with tiny platforms and one hit kill spikes in this game. The jump also feels shorter. There is a double jump, but it\\'s Little Mac-level awful, and honestly I\\'m not quite sure why it\\'s there. I feel like it used to be stronger when initially made but it was nerfed at some point, hard, and it really shouldn\\'t have been. I often found myself jumping at a platform that I really felt I should be able to make but... can\\'t. And it wasn\\'t the metroidvania \\'I\\'ll get an upgrade for this later\\' (you don\\'t) it was Maplestory Jump Quest level \"why can\\'t I just hit this?\"\\n\\nCombat:\\n\\nIt\\'s both better and worse, and altogether more defensive. For the first time ever, you now have a roll, and though it\\'s a bit finnicky and doesn\\'t quite \\'feel\\' right to be honest, it\\'s necessary to deal with like 3/4 of what this game throws at you. Altogether the attacks switched from platforming style \\'jump/run from the bullets\\' to \\'just roll.\\'\\n\\nYour maple leaf in this game is SIGNIFICANTLY slower and carries a whole lot less range. It also forces you significantly forward, which makes you often walk right into people\\'s hitboxes. I mean, it\\'s more interesting than the classic Momodora \"stand and mash attack as fast as you can\" but it\\'s also more frustrating.\\n\\nRanged seems to be the way to go, honestly. For the first time ever, this ninja shrine maiden has a bow instead of charms, and she spams arrows as fast as the other shrine maidens spam melee. Of course they deal almost no damage, though, and it takes a while, but it\\'s the safest option.\\n\\nDifficulty:\\n\\nRight onto it. This game is really frickin\\' hard. For some reason, starting from Momodora 3 this game took a turn for \"you either get the easiest game ever or you pay dearly.\" If you pick easy, expect an almost insulting level of easy - you\\'re practically invincible. If you pick Normal, though, prepare for what another game would consider Hard. It\\'s not even a fun kind of challenge difficulty, it\\'s a frustrating difficulty.\\n\\nThe bosses are meat shields that abuse the heck out of projectiles (roll often) or deal incredibly hard melee damage. They also seem to highlight all the issues with both platforming and combat. For example, one individual, the arsonist, cannot be attacked with melee. Why? Because though she has hitstun animations and it seems like the devs intended her to be melee-able, there is always fire on the ground around her. In other Momodora\\'s you could stand and attack, but since attacking moves you forward in this game, you ALWAYS walk into the fire. Your only options are to either spam arrows and slooooooowly chip damage or wait for your partner (who\\'s never elaborated on why she\\'s there or helping you) to kill her for you (which takes a while.) \\n\\nIn fact, almost all the bosses in this game encourage you to just stand and spam projectiles. There\\'s one boss with a giant sword that deals more than half your life in melee damage. I spent an hour trying to take her down the hard way, but the fact that she always broke in and out of hitstun seemingly randomly and avoiding her finnicky sometimes pixel perfect attacks was just frustrating, and I instead decided to just pelt arrows until she died. Not what I consider fun, and compared to the other Momodra\\'s bosses? Bad.\\n\\nThere is also a specific collectible, the ivory bug, that is extremely hard to see. It\\'s like 3 pixels or so and is often obscured by some foreground object. The challenge of collectibles should be uncovering the secret passage or doing the platforming challenge to get them, not seeing the dang thing.\\n\\nEtc.:\\n\\nThere are some \"it\\'s 2016 and this is the 4th game in the series so why is this still a thing\" problems with this game. See, I\\'m sure this was brought up before because Momodora 3 had the same issue: This game needs a serious epilepsy warning, when you get hit, it flashes bright red, when you die, it flashes red and black repeatedly and it hurts your eyes. If you fall into spikes prepare to get assaulted with both the flashing red of getting hit multiple times and then the death spam. Why can\\'t we just do a pause and fade to black, Metroid style? Or just shake the screen? Anything but this works.\\n\\nAlso, there aren\\'t any recongifurable controls. I personally found the keyboard controls questionable and there were things I wanted to switch (I\\'d love to use space or F to roll instead of the out of the way Q) and everyone has their own opinions, so why force us to use these controls? I used the xbox controls and it gave you a whopping two configurations that switched two buttons and that\\'s it. Again, it\\'s 2016, this is the 4th game in the series, this problem was here in Momodora 3 too, why is this still a thing?\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nDo I regret the 6 hours it took me to beat this game? No. Would I recommend it? Well, if you\\'re a Momodora fan, or you\\'re willing to put up with some pretty questionable design decisions, then okay. But I expected better from this series. Buy it to support the devs, but don\\'t expect gold like Momodora 2. Yet. Couldn\\'t recommend this enough. Great game! It\\'s only about 4 hours long but for 10 bucks thats about the right price. Gameplay feels great, awesome music as well. Looking forward to a sequel! Just finished hard mode.  This review is for challenge junkies out there.\\n\\nWhen you die, is it only due to your lack of skill?  Yes.\\nAre controls tight?  Absolutely.\\nAre enemies hard due to massive amounts of health?  No.\\nDo all enemies have a tell before firing an attack off, and are all the enemies unique?  Yes.  \\nDid you like Castlevania SotN but thought it was too easy?  Yes.\\n\\nIf the above answers make you happy, get it now.  Its fun, well designed, engaging, and WELL worth the price. Fun little game. If people here in the reviews mention its like sotn, they are right. It is, but in a good way. Cute little designs and also pretty short so if you are a two pump chump like myself you can be done within about an hour or so. Take the play time into consideration if you are okay with that, but otherwise this game is pretty solid. Controls are tight and art style is appealing. Buy it on sale, 10 bucks seems just a bit too much right now. This game is a masterpiece, loving it so far, and the fact that it isn\\'t so popular is almost heresy. I high recommend this game, if you\\'re looking for a challenge, stunning visuals, beautiful music, and just an all around good time. 10/10 thus far. Oh wow, another 2D game with a Metroidvania-ish design and claims to draw design influence from Dark Souls.  It\\'s a description you\\'ve probably read a million times before.  Now before you mentally checkout on this game, take notice that Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a legit very good game and one of the better 2D action games I\\'ve played in years.\\n\\n[h1]Controls and Combat[/h1]\\n\\nIn this type of game, the two things you\\'re going to do most are running/jumping around as you explore and fight enemies.  M:RUM does both well.  At first, the controls might feel slightly deliberate, but you\\'ll soon get used to them and by the end of the game you\\'ll be flying across the screen with air-dashes as a cat and it just feels good.  The character mobility as you progress throughout the game is great. You\\'re never fighting the controls, and the roll dodge mechanic is worked in quite well and it\\'s not something you see in many 2D action games.\\n\\nCombat is a bit simple.  You have your melee combo attack and a bow with infinite arrows and long-range.  Most enemy encounters are rather simple outside of their consistently strong character design and you\\'re best bet is to rush and bring the offensive to them instead of sitting back and trying to gauge their attacks.  Despite that, combat just feels good.  This is completely a \"feel\" thing, but I never got tired of fighting regular enemies despite the general nature of encounters being rather limited in options.  It helps that no enemies are health sinks, as most enemies die after a few hits and never become a chore to fight.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay Design[/h1]\\n\\nThe level design and interactivity is very well-done.  You can legitimately play a large portion of the game in any order you want.  You unlock power-ups by finishing each area that increase your mobility, combat ability, and give you the ability to warp, but there\\'s nothing stopping you from doing so in any particular order.  This gives the game a lot of replay value.  Almost all bosses have unlockable shortcuts that place them right next to a save point.\\n\\nMomodora has an equip/item system where consumable items recharge at save points.  I really like this mechanic in games that use it and here, it mainly deals with healing items.  Equipment is varied and versatile.  There\\'s all kind of accessories that do things like add fire to your attacks, serve as a magnet for coins, give a beep if you\\'re in a room with a secret item and much more.  There\\'s a ton of mix-and-matching to do if you want to vary up your playstyle a bit.  \\n\\n[h1]Other Stuff[/h1]\\n\\nVisually the game is quite nice, though I wish there were less dark areas.  Places like the forest and park look really nice and vibrant and I wish there was a bit more to the locale design color palette.  Animations are also great.  Things like rolling, notching arrows, attacking and using items look good and it doesn\\'t look like any corners were cut.\\n\\nAnother big drawing point in this type of game is secrets, and there are quite a lot.  Don\\'t want to spoil anything but there are a lot of little touches in the game that make it worth replaying.  As for replaying, there\\'s a new game+ that lets you keep all non plot-skills and items you unlocked which lets you just blow through the game at leisure and I\\'m a fan of this type of NG+.\\n\\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll get to some of the negative points of the game, which are mostly technical.  First off, no remappable buttons.  This is weird and is something I hope gets patched in.  Next, the in-game V-Sync seems to not work and there is minor screen tearing.  This is another thing that seems like it should be patched.  The \"you got hit\" sound effect is also quite harsh and shrill, and I wish I could tone it down.  Oh yeah, and a dedicated map button would be nice, too.  [i]3-30-16 EDIT:  A dedicated map button has been patched in, along with remappable keyboard controls, though no gamepad remapping is available.[/i]\\n\\nOn the non-technical side, my major gripe is the instant death spikes.  These things are terrible in every game they\\'re in, and they especially bad here, since it seems like they should just do some damage and let you leap out of them, but no, you just barely tap one and you\\'re dead.  This is by far the most annoying aspect of the gameplay, especially when you cover a decent bit of distance only to hit a spike right before a save point.  Making spikes just give a percentage of damage would make the game much less artificially aggravating and not hurt the the level of difficulty at all.  \\n\\nTwo lesser quibbles are that enemies do more damage then their attacks suggest, which will put you on the brink of death without you realizing it at times.  The last negative is something I touched on before, enemy encounters tend to feel rather samey, though killing stuff remains fun enough.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n\\nThat\\'s a lot of words.  In short, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is one of the better 2D actions games I\\'ve played in years.  Non-linear level design lets you progress in any direction you adventure with little artificial gating.  Character mobility is great.  The item and equipment systems are well-done and give a good dose of variety to the game.  There\\'s no fat or filler to hit some predetermined playtime requirement.  This is just a very good, well-designed game I\\'d recommend to anyone that likes 2D actions games and/or Metroidvania elements in their games. a nice video game A bite-sized Symphony of the Night, Momodora is an essential purchase for any lovers of that game or people who want to get into the genre but are strapped for time.\\n\\n I\\'m not a reviewer, but here\\'s what I liked about this game (cause it deserves attention and compliments!)\\n\\nThis game is real good. It\\'s cute and challenging, with a great atmosphere and design that just might prove how much the *Souls games lean on metroidvania mechanics - which are the two comparisons that can\\'t be avoided here, I guess... On it\\'s own, though, it\\'s still a really well designed exploratory platformer with fairly tight combat and movement, compelling character and world design, and great music that compliments the scenery and action. \\n\\nBoss Fight Highlight: PARDONER FENNEL. \\nFavorite Enemy: the floaty scythe flingers! To cut a long story short: \\n\\nI played it on hard, and it was basically a melee-focused metroid game with awesome graphics, a Dark Souls way of telling the story and plenty of awesome characters.\\n\\nIt is easy to recommend this to EVERYONE that likes Metroidvania or simply platformers with plenty of challenge on the combat.\\n\\nIMHO this game only suffers from having a really small world map, which I managed to 99% in less than 7 hours, not developing enough story with the characters and [spoiler]having a really short ending with a mockable boss that is far too easy compared to the other bosses, specially when it has 3 transformations and none of them is particularly interesting-looking or hard.[/spoiler] i bought this game because i saw that amazing trailer. and yes, its really cool :D\\n\\nthe normal mode was really hard even at the first stage, but the easy one made me feel invincible. i need something between them :| i like leafs now I\\'ve just started and I may update this review later but this is the biggest surprise of a game yet for me. This game feels sublime to play once you learn the combat and its tight deliberate mechanics. It is some of the closest I\\'ve come to that feeling the first time I played through Dark Souls of mystery challenge and perseverance. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys metroidvainias and Dark Souls. From the art to the gameplay, this is an indie masterpiece.\\n\\nUpdate after finishing: Took me about 3h30m for my first playthrough and iI have to say my only complaint about this game is I wish there was more for me to play which is not a bad thing and I felt like it was a good length for the pricetag. I have a feeling I may run through this game a few more times and maybe even check out speedrunning it. Loved this game highly recommended. I really like the dark fantasy setting of this game. \\nThe art looks amazing and the controls are smooth. Sure, the keyboard-controls can\\'t be remapped, but that\\'s just something you get used to.\\nOh, and don\\'t get too attached to the characters.\\n\\nSince it\\'s a Prequel I won\\'t criticise the ending ... ;_; Beautifully detailed sprites.\\nFluid, expressive animation.\\nGorgeous, atmospheric levels.\\nSatisfying skill-based battles.\\nTons of secrets to be discovered.\\nYou can turn into a cat.\\n\\nThis is a game well worth your time. Incredibly gorgeous and atmospheric, and plays like a dream.  It takes many of the best elements from both the Souls series (in regards to storytelling and item consumption in particular) and the metroidvania genre, and blends it all together in a lovingly crafted gameworld that immediately left me wanting more.  One of the most enjoyable games I\\'ve played in a long time.  My only real complaint is that I wish it were longer! Only about an hour in, but this game so far is incredible. Very atmospheric, great art, music is excellent as well. The platforming controls very well everything is responsive and fluid. The enemies are strong and put a fear in you that if you make one slip-up you will die. The game will punish you and most bosses you will have to try to fight more than once as you will get 1-shotted often. Overall a very great platformer. Highly reccomended. I don\\'t normally like Metroidvania type games since in my experience they tend to err on the side of overly obtuse and diffcult.  Momodora however gets it right - the game is easy to wrap your head around, has modern amenities (in-game map!), a great soundtrack, and multiple difficulty levels. Pretty damn fun. Played on normal mode. Easy is a COMPLETE joke. Normal is fairly challenging. Hard looks like you get nearly one shotted by everything. It\\'s somewhat like Dark Souls in that its pretty unforgiving if you fuck up as well as the atmosphere and story; it\\'s a pretty grizzly tale. I finished the game and the ending I got makes me pretty much certain that there are more endings to the game so I\\'ll probably beat it again and try to figure out how to get a better ending. The pixel graphics are fantastic as well. Boss fights could use a little work, just seemed a bit repetetive, some were better than others. Nothing really stood out as far as music goes but it was pretty good. But the biggest flaw in the game is how short it is, I beat it in four hours, not going particularly fast. I will probably play it again, which is partly because the game is short, so maybe it\\'s not that bad a thing. A little more length and more interesting bosses would make this an absolute masterpiece. Still a great game though 8.5/10. All I can say is, as an avid Dark Souls player I felt right at home playing this game. \\n\\nBeautiful levels, beautiful sprites, interesting characters, dark story and amazing combat. This game is everything I could have wanted from a 2D platformer.\\n\\nSide note: This was my first Momodora game but it certainly won\\'t be my last.\\n I don\\'t normally go out of my way to write reviews for anything, but in this case I feel it is 100% warranted. Dark Souls and Metroidvania are my two all time favorite franchises, and I feel that this game is a perfect incarnation of them both. This is the greatest cure for the itch I have had for this type of game, and I couldn\\'t be more thankful for it. From the standpoint of the game itself, it\\'s all around fantastic. The graphics and art are beautiful, the combat is simple yet satisfying, and the challenge level is just right.\\n\\nThis is a franchise that I pray evolves and lives long. 10/10. The gameplay and art direction for this game are fantastic. I can\\'t wait to see speedruns of it. I like this and the fact the weapon is a leaf is awesome. It\\'s difficult to explain why this game feels so amazing.  A large part of it is that it effectively embraces nostalgia; it feels and plays like a game you might have played on Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo, but it has the added bonus of being so fluidly animated that it feels like the BEST version of the game you might have played.  It\\'s hard, but it never feels like the difficulty is a punishment: you die, you learn, you get better, you continue on.  The soundtrack is phenomenal.  The character design is very anime-ish, which might be a turn off to some, but it feels appropriate and the sprite based animation makes it a joy to watch in motion.  I haven\\'t gotten very far, but I\\'ve been highly enjoying it.  Can\\'t wait to see what else this developer does. Great game, had a ton of fun with it. The Dark Souls of anime pixel art 2d platformers.\\n\\nPossibly the most outstanding thing about this game is the attention to detail.  All of the animations, both for the main character and the enemies/bosses are very good, and the controls are tight.  The items have flavor text reminiscent of From Software games, and the NPC interactions should seem familiar too.  It\\'s a very short game, but that\\'s probably for the best.  There are in-game ways to get 100% completion pretty easily, which is a big plus for me, though if you\\'re not that worried about it you can instead use the item slots to buff your attacks ect.  There\\'s also newgame+ if you don\\'t care about finding everything in one playthrough, though the differences are pretty slight.  The music is also very nice, and mostly contained to boss fights.\\n\\nAbsolutely buy this game if you have ever enjoyed a metroidvania. A very fun metroidvania game that challenges you all throughout the game. It take a rather decent step away from Momodora III in most ways. Most notably is the art style. It\\'s damn good. Everything looks fluid, colorful, and realistic for all animations making it a very pleasing to look at. Another change is the difficultly. I feel like the Dark Souls and Bloodborne was being played while making this game. The amount of dodge roll, the amount of damage you take, and the flower animation stand out to me the most but there are pleanty of other things you feel is very Dark Souls about the game and while 90% of other games try it as well, this is one of the few that does it right. Enemies feel placed in a way that punishes you for trying to rush and with the amount of damage that is done, on hard at least, makes you slow down to a steady pace that\\'s neither too slow nor too fast. Another nice change of pace is the length of the game. Momodora III takes only 1-2 hours on your first run and can be speed runned under 10 minutes while Momodora 4 took me 5 hours on the first run and I\\'d imagine the speed run being around 30-40 minutes. \\n\\nMy only real complaints is the music and the items. Most of the music is just ambiance that doesn\\'t stand out except for bosses and 2 areas and while the boss music is okay, the area music is forgettable. I actually only remember 2 pieces and one of those is because I died like 15 times on a certain boss and the other was the final boss fights. My other complaint is how the items aren\\'t exactly balanced and a lot do the same thing. There\\'s like 5 ways to boost your attack but once you get to the end, you have a deadly dou combo that makes the game too much easier. I feel like Momodora III handled these two much better and hopefully in Momodora 5, we\\'ll get a combonation of the two games.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a huge improvement over Momodora III. If you\\'re a fan of the series or have just looked at the game and thought \"that looks interesting\" then you won\\'t be disappointed. Very solid 4/5 Overall, I believe the game is worth the £6.99, and perhaps more.\\n\\n+ Art is very good\\n+ Story is pretty decent\\n+ Gameplay is easy to pick up\\n+ Boss fights are fun and rewarding.\\n\\n0 The game is about 3 hours long with 97% map exploration (map exploration is the way the game describes your completion), but the game does offer a NG+ mode, and at least two different endings. I am still going to play this some more.\\n\\n- The way the game handles spikes can be frustrating. If you hit spikes, you are insta-dead.\\n- Sometimes it\\'s not clear where you\\'re supposed to be going, only for you to find out that you have to backtrack. Game is gud. Hey, that\\'s pretty good. Essentially, this game is amazing and quite the improvement over Momodora 3! I  bought this game when it came out then i beat it yesterday. And i can say it\\'s quite fun though i don\\'t if it\\'s me but the game felt quite short so i decided to play it again but on a harder diffculty. Buy this game even if you haven\\'t played the other games before, just buy it! Momodora is an interesting Metroidvania type game. I\\'m not usually fan of this type of game, but the cute artwork and beautiful music drew me to it. I have a soft spot for cute female protagonists, what can I say? I\\'ve completed 100% of the map, but still have plenty of challenges to do, like a pacifist run and a run without dying. Not to mention collecting Ivory Bugs & completing Insane difficulty.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the art and music is beautiful. The gameplay itself is also smooth and responsive (I am using a keyboard and the only issue I have is forgetting which buttons do what). Transition between the various rooms is fluid and feel rather nice. The bosses are unique and have a variety of mechanics, but for the most part you can look for a pattern and beat them.\\n\\nSpeaking of the bosses, they range from mini-bosses to full on kick-your-ass bosses. The hardest boss for me so far took me around 10 tries to kill it, while before that one, I averaged about 3 tries. For the most part, you will encounter the bosses in a linear fashion but occasionally you can fight them depending on your preference. (I probably killed that hard boss before I was actually supposed to)\\n\\nWhile exploring the map, you\\'ll encounter areas you can\\'t reach yet. You will unlock these as you progress (obtaining new abilities), kill bosses, or obtain keys. You\\'ll be backtracking a few times, but there is a lovely little map feature so you can keep track of where to go.\\n\\nIn your travels, you will encounter various characters that give you information or background about the world. It is a nice way to give the option of learning about the world without forcing you into too many forced-reading sessions.\\n\\nAll in all, it is a pretty decent game. I was able to complete it in about 7 hours in my first run, so it is definately worth the $10 price.\\n\\n**As a side note, after completing the game, it lets you start over, and keep most of your items & your HP increase. You lose your upgrades and key items. In this \"New Game+\" mode, I was able to complete the game in little over an hour. (I should add at this point, I\\'m playing on Normal difficulty) Beautiful is the only way i can describe this gem...\\n\\nCombat is simple yet complex, the music is just... gorgeous.\\n\\nIt has my metroidvania fix that ive sought for quite sometime.\\n\\nIts cheap and very fun to play. do yourself a favor... buy this game. Quite a few reviews appear to be comparing this game to Dark Souls and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I would say this is only partially correct: I honestly find it more akin to Bloodborne in setting, with its dark city riddled with plague and monsters. \\n\\nThe game follows the short but sweet route: most gamers blitzing the game will find it only takes a few hours to see most of what it has to offer, and will probably hit the final boss of the game by the 4th or 5th hour mark if they do not spend a good deal of time grinding or gathering every ivory bug they may miss. \\n\\nHowever, each area is so beautiful its difficult to describe. No two places look alike, and although every area is not exceedingly large in scale, all of them utilize incredible sprite work to give each a wonderful personality. \\n\\nIf  your a fan of explorative RPG platformers that prefer you see the ending a bit quicker than usual, this is a good game to give a shot. You won\\'t spend as long as you may think in the city, but you will certainly remember it fondly for every dark corner you searched for lore and loot. Just by lookin\\' at the trailer and reading a few of these reviews down here should already give you the notion and belief that at one point in this game you\\'ll get to beat up a big boob witch\\'s bewbs (Which happens to be her only hitbox) with a maple leaf and watch them bounce around as she lobs energy balls at your face. [spoiler]Which happen to hurt. [I]A lot[/I][/spoiler]\\n\\nI mean like, there are loads of other kewl boss battles and stuff here too...\\nbut I guess that might be the main highlight for some peeps.\\n\\n[h1][I]The game is really kewl.

Final bit of the game is a bit lacking, but don\\'t let that dissuade you from not getting this lovely game <3 Fantastic game just like the previous game before it! Art is great, combat is great, nice little Metroidvania.  Good game. i can honestly say this is one of the best 2D games i have ever experienced the gameplay and level design is super solid and i dont think ill ever be able to get over the beautiful artwork and boss fights,I would heavily recommend playing this if you even have the tiniest bit of intrest to play it. Its an unbeleivably good game. boss battles are creative, story is intriguing. the only complaiant i have is with the controls \\n(a to ju,p was a bad idea) id give it a 9/10 I don\\'t normally care to recommend games.\\n\\nThis is a really, damn good one. It\\'s pretty damn good.\\n\\nHaving followed Momodora since the beginning, Reverie Under the Moonlight is a very welcome installment to the series. It introduces so many new mechanics, such as rolling, combos, and bellflowers. Looking back at the nature of each game, RUtM is definitely the most technical. 1 and 2 were Cave Story-esque without the focus on mashing, 3 was extremely button-mash heavy, and RUtM is definitely—and people are going to hate reading this—Dark Souls-esque. You must take advantage of and master every mechanic provided to you.\\n\\nThe graphics and music are byfar the best in the series. With solemn representations of a dark, wet ruins, and the emotional timing of the score upon discovering something [i]huge[/i], Momodora 4 definitely delivers a deep, soulful, and beautiful experience. Very enjoyable metroidvania game. Run around, smacking people with a leaf, and probably dying a lot (unless you use some cheesy strats, which you probably don\\'t need by the time you can use them anyway).\\n\\nTook about 4 hours to get the true ending with 100% map (but not 100% items, missed over half the bugs and at least one health upgrade), but they were 4 very enjoyable hours. Who knew a maple leaf was a good weapon for melee fights? This game looks truly gorgeous and the animations are pretty fluid and have weight and character. There\\'s different visual effects for a lot of abilities and enemies. The enemy designs are very diverse and interesting. Momodora: RUtM gives you a challenge even on normal difficulty but it doesn\\'t feel unfair, save points are spaced pretty well. The game lets you explore at your own pace and theres many secrets to find. \\n\\nI haven\\'t finished the game yet but will probably update my review later. But so far, I\\'d say it\\'s worth the money if you enjoy 2d platformers with simple combat. I enjoyed the previous game and I\\'m sure you\\'d enjoy this game as well if you were a fan of Momodora III. Great little metroidvania with fantastic art and animation, moody soundscapes, and challenging but satisfying gameplay.\\n\\nWhile it takes some inspiration from the Souls games (lore heavily relies on reading item descriptions, healing is limited and restored at rest points, animations require some commitment and can\\'t be canceled), it is very much its own beast.\\n\\nIt is a little on the short side, but the reasonable price and added challenge modes ensure that you\\'ll get far more than your money\\'s worth.\\n\\nAbsolutely recommended for genre fans. I\\'m about an hour into this game and I have to say that this game is fun and quite hard. One of my favorite things about the game is when I find a new enemy and I don\\'t know what kind of attack to expect, I wind up getting wrecked because I underestimated how strong they are. I really like the dodge mechanic that when timed right can make you avoid any attack. I would recommend this game anyone, especially if they\\'re looking for a challenge. The gameplay is great, the visuals are very pretty, and the story so far is interesting. I got the soundtrack as well and I think its fantastic to listen to. Imagine if Cave Story had a baby with Dark Souls. That\\'s basically this game.\\nGood stuff. A great game, with great challenge and simple but fair combat. \\nBeing very metroidvania-like, Momodora will send you back and forth through it\\'s world always ready to surprise you with it\\'s catches and secrets. The aesthetics of the game are very well thought through and along with the colours and the fluid pixel art animations, it\\'s like playing through a piece of art.\\nMomodora delivers at least 5 hours of engaging gameplay and while your character doesn\\'t say much, your surroundings do, which creates an amazing narrative experience.\\nIf you like Metriodvania stuff and have a thing for pixels, then get this game. Very atmospheric and challenging! Could not stop playing once I started. Highly recommended if youre a fan of Dark Souls and Castlevania This game is hard and a unfair. I enjoy it a lot. What a strange little game. Most people seem to call it a mixture of Castlevania SOTN and Dark Souls, which I somewhat agree with. It clearly has drawn inspiration from the gameplay of SOTN and the story/lore of Dark Souls. But it lacks the depth of them.\\n\\nI just beat the game in 3 hours and 34 minutes with 97% of the map discovered, which kind of confused me. Is the game pulling a SOTN twist on me? Is there an upside down castle somewhere? Well, I got the achievement for \"True ending\", so I don\\'t think that is the case, but I hope I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nThe game started hard, really hard, and kept the difficulty up even after you learned the ropes by introducing a few new enemies and new bosses with their own patterns and strategies, but after getting the first (and as far as I know the only) upgrade to your weapon about 3/4 in, every boss battle turns into a joke. I beat the final boss in a single go in less than 3 minutes, which is disappointing to me. (I\\'m really hoping there is a \"true\" final boss to be discovered!)\\n\\nThe OST is fantastic. Very moody piano stuff, again clearly inspired by SOTN. \\nGameplay wise, it\\'s nothing special. I hate to keep referencing SOTN, but think of that, but dumbed down a bit. It\\'s still very fun and feels good.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the game falls flat towards the end. It stops introducing new characters, throws an unnamed miniboss battle at you and suddenly you\\'re in the last room of the game fighting the last boss.\\n\\nI guess the journey is more important than the destination in this case.\\n\\nAnd the journey was a good one. This game was deceptively cute. A short game, but very fun nonetheless. I beat it on normal with moderate difficulty, im sure Hard is much more difficult. The combat felt very fluid, and while not very advanced, I think it benefits from being more simple so you can concentrate more on not dying to some tough patterns. If you like any Metroidvania, Dark Souls, or Touhou games, this is most likely the game for you.\\n\\nThere is one thing that I didn\\'t like though, and it has to do with how some of the characters are involved with the story. [spoiler]Not much background or resolution has been given to some otherwise interesting characters. They didn\\'t really feel too connected to your story, although I guess the gist of it is that they\\'re all on their own path and end up going their own ways at some point in the story. Not a big deal, but it probably could have added much more to the overall experience.[spoiler] Momodora: RUtM is a 2D Side-Scrolling Platform game which has you travelling to various locations in an attempt to take down the corrupted Queen who has infected Kaho\\'s village of Lan, in all seriousness, this is a really good game, as someone who plays 2D Side-Scrolling Platformers often, I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is also a fan, the game itself is fairly short, but I find it has good replay value, I\\'ve found myself playing through this game multiple times already and I am currently speedrunning it and planning to pick up 100% for it fairly soon, once you actually find where everything is, it\\'s hard to forget, although I still find myself making mistakes over and over again and if you\\'re looking for a challenge, I reccomend trying to beat Hard Difficulty and even Insane Difficulty which you unlock for beating Hard, I am yet to beat Insane Difficulty but I wish any who try the best of luck. Everything I love about 2d platformers rolled into one. \\n\\nI\\'m a huge castlevania nut so the metroidvania style feels right at home. It has a very nice almost Cave Story like artstyle and it has a dark souls system of combat. Rolling gives you i-frames, and you have a limited amout of healing items until you hit your next save point. So far I am only 30 minutes in and have come across 3 bosses all with pretty nice mechanics. The game also has a nice eerie OST so far.\\n\\nThis is a must play for any 2d action platformer lover. If you enjoy old Castlevania games or the Souls saga: this game was made for you.\\nShort but with replay value. It\\'s more an early access game than a real game. It has nothing special as a platfom game, and there is no soundtrack, no music at all. Just some fx sounds.\\n\\nUpdate: The music begins when you find the first boss. Forest or City have no music. A great plataform game with an awesome OST. If you like Castlevania SOTN, it\\'s much like his style. But take care, not everything that seems cute is easy too. Not as difficult as some people make it out to be. Aesthetically pleasing to look at and a joy to play. buy momodora 4\\n\\nAnyways, with that outta the way, time for an actual review.\\n\\nAs the fourth installment in the Momodora series, I\\'ve been following along for a while now, and I\\'ve loved to see this series grow. Reverie Under the Moonlight is wonderfully polished, and is well able to stand on its own as a strong representative of the Momodora series. \\n\\nThe atmosphere and plot got to me in ways that I didn\\'t expect, and through immersing yourself more in the world, it rewards you even more. The combat is greatly satisfying, and just that alone is enough to make repeated playthroughs enjoyable throughout. Through the music and sound effects in general, both the atmosphere and combat are even further accentuated, and honestly, it\\'s just so nice to play.\\n\\nI love this series. Excellent. If you enjoyed SotN or GBA and DS games that followed, buy this. It has a cute cat in it. \\n10/10 In short great game with some minor faults.   Well worth the asking price.\\n\\nMusic - Really good.   Always matches the tone and environment you are in.\\n\\nVisuals - Really gorgeous game, especially in motion.   Love this  art style.\\n\\nGameplay - Combat system is extremely responsive once you get used to it which doesn\\'t take long.   Only complaint is that bosses are really easy with some trash mobs being much harder.  \\n\\nOverall it took me 4 hours to beat the game and IMO was worth the asking price. So i felt the need of having a new game when i came across seeing this and i am completely pleased with it.\\nthe chalanges in this game are great to fight agenst.\\nthe artstyle is just beutifull to look into and get lost in it.\\nthe soundtrack is amazing and gives great mood of the setting, it can easily bring a tear to your eye in some cases.\\nfor the price this game is more then worth it. Its a perfect blend of punishing old school game play and metroidvania exploration/progression. \\n\\nA must buy for people that miss the glory days of the Nes and Snes. \\n\\nIm really in love with this game <3 It\\'s probably been said before but this is a perfect mix of the MetroidVania formula.\\nBig world to explore, tons of powerups and secrets to collect, an awesome atmosphere and OST.\\nEverything\\'s there. Now if only I could dodge better... [h1]Holy shit this game is good.[/h1]\\n\\n Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is damn near the greatest pixel platformer I\\'ve ever played. It feels extraordinarly weird to say that about a game that came out in 2016, needing to compete with classical masterpieces like metroid, megaman and castlevania but its just legitimately so good.\\n\\n  The gameplay is satisfying and varied. It ranges from fast paced and action packed to technical and deliberate, with everything in between. There is a a plethora of attacks; cancels, dodge rolls, air dodges, transformations, lovingly hand crafted frame by frame, along with a selection of items, buffs and skills that add variation and new tactics. The animations are superb and fluid, nothing feels jerky or floaty. It has been polished to perfection. \\n\\n  The world is beatifully crafted. Each area has a unique color scheme and art direction that, combined with changes in music that flow dynamically, give them their own personality. Music plays when appropriate, and changes in tone/tempo and mood when appropriate, adding beautifully to the atmosphere that will suck you in so you can\\'t stop playing. There are plenty of (literal gameplay and story based)secrets to find, narrative puzzles to put together, as well as people and things to see.\\n\\n  Most of the story is told not by the characters in the game, and not from information about the world you find lying around, but by your emotions and the way you connect to the environment itself. This may seem pretentious, but really, It\\'s the little things. Like watching the grass part when you shoot an arrow through it. Like watching the water reflect and distort the world around it. Little things that make you think \"wow\". Changes in lighting, wind speed, and the environment around you are shone in the way your outfit looks and reacts to the world around it, be it reflections, animation speed etc. The noises the enemies make range from innocent, to heartbreaking, to scary. There are signs of battle you find, signs of peace you find, the personal effects of people you\\'ll never see. People who have died, left, or disappeared without finishing their story. There\\'s one part where I found a woman who had all but given up, and there was nothing I could do for her. I never thought I\\'d see her again, thinking she was a random npc only there to add some drama to the environment; I was right, but not at all in the way I\\'d initially thought. No detail in this game is without purpose. There\\'s always something more.\\n\\nIt will take between 3-5 hours to beat your first playthrough, and there is more than one ending. \\n\\nIt\\'s 2016, it\\'s exceedingly rare to find a game quite so complete, and quite so good, for the asking price of just ten dollars, yet here you are. This is an absolute must play for platformer fans, sidescroller fans, indie fans, etc. I would even go so far as to recommend this game to everyone, even people that aren\\'t traditionally fans of platformers. I recommend this game. This is harsh. Evaluate Me! Souls like but not that hard(also contains difficulty settings); very good quality on its pixel art and won\\'t let you miss anything should be saw (enemy and its attacks, background can be easily identified); and very good balance on play pacing.\\nVery good game experience for me. I smacked some giant tatas with a leaf. Then I died a lot. Today was a good day. 10/10 I never really got into Dark Souls, and I think its because I wasn\\'t a fan of really difficult games.  Momodora has disprovent that for me, by taking that format and applying it to the metroidvaina-style gameplay that I\\'ve always loved.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ve only played a little of it so far, but I can tell that this is going to be one of the games I go back to many times in the future.  Never is the game so difficult that its frustrating, but its far from easy.  They really did a good job of brining the idea that if you die, its your fault.  Ambushes have tells, traps have triggers, you\\'ll be able to figure it out if you stop and assess a room before rushing right in.  Its a huge change of pace from normal metriodvanias, and it works well.\\n\\nOne thing that helps it along is the tone.  A contrast of the bright, cutesy characters set across an opressive backdrop really blends well.  I feel that it helps keep from being too stressful, while at the same time making sure to keep you on your guard, that this isn\\'t a game where you can just turn off your brain and blaze through it.\\n\\nYou can see the love for both Dark Souls and Castlevania that went into this.  The developers unabashidly pull all sorts of gameplay elements from the two; from map layout, to the healing and combat mechanics, the map, even the setting itself.  But that\\'s not bad by any means.  The game doesn\\'t have any new gimmicks it wants to throw at you, and because of that, the developers were able to mesh tried and true mechanics and in the process, make something truely unique in the process.\\n\\nAlso, its like, nine dollars.  Rarely are you going to see something with this level of polish for that cheap. I\\'ve been a fan of Momodora for a few years now. I originally found the first two games for [b]free[/b] on the [url=http://www.bombservice.com/games.html]developer\\'s website.[/url]It\\'s honestly been pretty cool to see this series evolve. \\n\\nThe controls in every game are really simple, including this one. You can use your controller this time as well. Combat in Momo 4 is pretty neat since they added dodging. Attacking with your leaf is a little slower than in the previous games, but the animation looks really nice. There\\'s also a ranged attack, which I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen since Momo 2. It\\'s really good for picking off common enemies at a distance.\\n\\nThe environments are pretty (more exploration, woo!), the music fits the atmosphere really well, and the art is as cute and pixely as always. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for an action platformer to play. It\\'s a fun game at just the right length. its cool\\n 10/10 would die again  Keep in mind that all of my thoughts on this game from from the PoV of someone who has not played any of the previous Momodora games.\\n\\n\\tOn it\\'s steam page in a letter from the developer it says \"I wouldn\\'t call Momodora: RUtM a metroidvania or a Souls-like, but there are elements of both in there.\" While this is true that Momo:RUtM carries elements of both in it\\'s gameplay, the atmosphere is carried over the most. Momo:RUtM has a great atmosphere, it is dark, oppressive, and heavy, where you can feel the weight of despair that lingers in the air of this city plagued by demons and the undead. There are wonderfully designed enemies, environments, and music. The controls feel tight, the hit detection sharp, and it is a joy to continue exploring this game to see what is in the next area. I definitely look forward to playing more of the game and the value proposition of this game definitely makes it worth the $9-$10 it is currently on sale for.\\n\\n\\tHowever this game has some problems. In a word I would summarize my gripes with this game as \"Inconsistent.\" I played this on normal difficulty, and at times the difficulty sine waves between difficult but fair, and ball busting hard. Particullarly a boss called the pardoner, who I encountered in the monastery about an hour in. This is what would be the third-ish boss that I came across. I was not able to beat this boss after over ten tries of varying success. Her attacks are barely telegraphed if at all, making dodging them hard if not outright impossible. Particularly the second attack in her combo which has a massive backswing that makes jumping over and dodge-rolling through very difficult. Along with one attack which curses you temporarily locking the use of your items. the problem with this is that the start of this attack is no different than the other attacks, is VERY fast, and has an AoE that covers a sizable portion of the fighting area. The biggest gripe with this attack in particular is that the attack\\'s AoE kicks up a purple cloud that dissappears, however this cloud can still curse you when it has almost completely vanished and is hard to tell that it is even there anymore. And being cursed means that you cannot heal yourself. \\n\\n\\tBy the way bug report. There is a small black square of blank space after uncovering the hidden are just to the right of the save point in the room outside of the pardoner\\'s room.\\n\\n\\tI do feel like I take WAAAAAY too much damage from enemies, regularly loosing anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of my health in a single hit, and needing 2 of the five uses of my healing item to restore that damage. That and the insta kill damage spikes are just a kick in the nuts at times. Maybe 60% of the deaths I\\'ve experienced so far I\\'ve felt that weren\\'t because I had fucked up, but because the game said \"Okay you die now. No more HP for you.\"\\n\\nSummary: A challenging platformer with great atmosphere and some problems with consistent difficulty. This series has come a long way. That being said, you don\\'t need to play any of the previous ones to enjoy or understand this one. If you\\'re coming into this series start here, play III if you like it - then play I&II (which are both free and hopefully get put on steam so its easier to play them). I absolutely adore this game. The pixel art, the gameplay, the characters, and the music are all top notch and entirely noteworthy. A deep and challenging experience, at a very enjoyable length. The game doesn\\'t overstay its welcome for a single playthrough and I\\'m more than pleased to run through it for all the possible endings. Easily in my top 5 for 2016 already. Smack Breasts with leaf so i started the game and was given the option to pick a difficulty. I\\'m not the kind of guy to go with easy and i feel like I\\'ve played enough platformers to be better than normal so i picked hard.\\nI have already died 4 times in the 10 minutes I\\'ve played.\\nGotta run before you can walk.\\nI\\'m loving it. Quite good, Nice Castlevania vibe with some Dark Souls here and there for good measure. It is rather short, finished a first playthough in around ~3 hours 20, buuuut as it turns out I got a bad ending, so there is some replayability to it in that sense. \\nControls are very responsive, and enemy hitboxes are quite fair in the sense that I never got hit by something that really shouldn\\'t have. I have only two particular gripes: Firstly, No seperate button for the map, both start and select open the menu, so you have to shuffle over to it manually, minor but still. Secondly an ability you pick up roughly half-way through *probably* should\\'ve been it\\'s own button, rather than taking an active item slot, slightly more inconvenient that the map thing, but still pretty minor.\\n\\nOverall? I quite highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a nice, tightly controlling combat platformer with a bit of bite to it.\\n\\nEdit: They have added a map hotkey, so that minor negative is now moot. Really nice little doujinvaniasouls that I hadn\\'t heard of until today. Great animation and aesthetics, solid-feeling controls (if a little too obviously Souls-inspired in terms of the weightiness and the delays). So far I\\'m afraid it might be a little too straightforward, but otherwise this is pretty much perfect. From all the deadly weapons known to existence you chose a leaf?\\n10/10\\n100/100\\nbest game.\\nBEST GAME. If you\\'re looking for an excellent metroidvania with tight mechanics then look no further. The initial cuteness hides the much more oppressive world just below the surface.\\n\\n+Spritework that puts most other indie games to shame\\n+A simple, but interesting story told through dialogue and item descriptions.\\n+Tight Platforming\\n+Excellent Atmosphere\\n+BGM that enhances the experience.\\n+Tight dodge mechanics\\n+Healing is limited between shrines similar to souls games.\\n+Enemy variety is interesting.\\n+Boss fights feel challenging, and quick reflexes are just as useful as pattern memorization.\\n+Plenty of secrets to uncover\\n+Items that allow for different playstyles\\n+Multiple difficulty options\\n+Good length for the genre*\\n\\n*3.5 hours on a blind \"Normal\" playthrough getting 100% exploration and True ending, but missing some side objectives. Cute. Great control. Enough challenge. Just right length.\\n\\nGreat game for the right price. Fully recommended.\\n please play on hard mode.\\n\\n\\nSO MUCH FUN !!!\\n Early thoughts on the game:\\n\\nThis was so worth the wait between 3 till now.\\n\\n[b]Graphics:[/b] You can see how much work went into the environments feeling atmospheric and awesome. Enemies feel at home with the different area locations. THE BACKGROUNDS are phenominal. I loved Momodora 1 - 3, but this game with only 2 hours under my belt, feels every bit better than its predecessor, in the same way that each game has felt more and more its own, and as far from a cave story clone as you can get.\\n\\n[b]Music:[/b] right from the main menu splash screen is spot on.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] Is it hard - Yes? I feel challenging is more appropriate. But the balance is more towards generic enemies do a ton of dmg per hit. Not insta kill, but enough that you should always attack first and see if their not hostile later.\\n\\nThank you to the developer for including a SotN style map. This was my only problem with Castle in the Darkness, so much so that I spent 3 days making a map for the community. So I appreciate it to no end that it was part of development.\\n\\nEveryone who contributed to this games patreon, thank you.\\n\\nThis is the metroidvania game that we have all been waiting for, and I need to get back to playing. fun stuff. Very good game, like Dark Souls and SOTN had a side-scrolling baby.\\n\\n+Atmosphere is depressing as hell and its great.\\n+Great soundtrack\\n+ Tight controls and solid gameplay\\n\\nWould smack witch boobs with a maple leaf again A tremendous surprise compared to the previous game. I was a pretty big fan of Momodora III, so I bought this game totally blind and expected it to be an extension of all the things I loved about the first.\\nI was stunned and delighted to find that this game is leaps and bounds ahead of the previous while still maintaining all of the satisfying, simple, and challenging combat and encounters. The character sprites have been entirely redone in a larger size with more lovingly placed pixels than ever, and the game is set in a more properly connected world that begs to have every nook and cranny fully explored several times.\\n\\nI know the Dark Souls comparison does get thrown around a lot these days, but Momodora RUtM really *does* feel like Darks Souls\\'s adorable little sister, and I mean that in the most affectionate way possible. From the beginning controls are kinda difficult but don\\'t worry you\\'ll really fast get used to them. Game\\'s graphic is really fantastic but about the game It looks like 2D Dark Souls. If you enjoy impossible difficulty, cool graphic, awesome plot and character who looks like Red from Undertale.I recommend you to buy this game! Challenging\\n\\nGreat Atmosphere\\n\\nGreat Soundtrack\\n\\nGreat Visuals\\n\\nGreat Game. Why oh why did I choose hard mode? Welcome home, good priestess.\\nWhat is it you desire? buttery smooth platformer F*ck it! Time to die endlessly again and again. So far so cute Quite a masterpiece of an indie platformer. A beautiful, smooth flowing platformer with a lot of challenge! Dark Souls + Castlevania SOTN + Kawaii = Momodora RUtM. Great game! This is a very good and very short game. If you have ever wanted a 2d platformer with some soulslike mechanics such as rolling, save points and refillable items, then there is a decent chance you will enjoy your time on it. It combines that with an interesting story with fun (and relatively easy) bosses all wrapped up in a metroidvania package. I did have some minor issues with the game such as the way spawn points were set and the warp mechanic. The warp system only takes you to a specific bell in an area and you have to work your way through enemies to get to whichever bell you need to be at to progress. This was somewhat frustrating at times considering that this game does promote backtracking in order to find special items and collectibles. This was coupled with the fact that warping doesn\\'t set your spawn point to the bell you warped to, meaning you also have to make sure you set your spawn in case you die. Other than that, it was a fun and short game.'"

    "- Uncontract any words to their full form: This usually makes it easier to clean text data and is an optional step. Examples are words like ain’t or we’ll, which is converted into ‘is not’ or ‘we will’.\n",
    "- Remove any stopwords: These are words that do not provide any sort of information to what we’re trying to find or just appear way too frequently. Articles and prepositions are examples of stopwords.\n",
    "- Punctuations, emojis and emoticons, numbers: They’re not words, so it’s best to remove them.\n",
    "- Parts-of-speech: These are tags that indicate the position of the word in the sentence, whether they’re a noun, verb, preposition, etc.\n",
    "- Lemmatization: It’s a technique or method where the words are converted back into their root or base form, such as converting the word ‘confusing’ to the base form ‘confused’. Makes it easier to understand the words for analysis. The POS tag is also used to lemmatize the words based on their position."
