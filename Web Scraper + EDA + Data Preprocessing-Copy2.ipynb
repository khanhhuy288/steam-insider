       "   'review': \"This is a very good and very short game. If you have ever wanted a 2d platformer with some soulslike mechanics such as rolling, save points and refillable items, then there is a decent chance you will enjoy your time on it. It combines that with an interesting story with fun (and relatively easy) bosses all wrapped up in a metroidvania package. I did have some minor issues with the game such as the way spawn points were set and the warp mechanic. The warp system only takes you to a specific bell in an area and you have to work your way through enemies to get to whichever bell you need to be at to progress. This was somewhat frustrating at times considering that this game does promote backtracking in order to find special items and collectibles. This was coupled with the fact that warping doesn't set your spawn point to the bell you warped to, meaning you also have to make sure you set your spawn in case you die. Other than that, it was a fun and short game.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Momodora: RUtM is the 4th game in the series and easily the best. It's a 2-d action platformer with a simple yet rewarding combat system and difficulty options aplenty. The game is pretty short, about 4 hours on my first play-through (on switch). If you play on normal, I would recommend a second play-through on insane, which adds enemies and drastically lowers the player health bar. Other than that, there isn't a ton of replay value unless you want to find all the hidden collectibles. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this game.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"[h1] An Important Note     [/h1]\\nSpecial thanks to my buddy Jp. For a good palate cleanser of a game.\\n\\n[h1]One Priestess to Stop a Deadly Curse [/h1]\\nBasic premise/Story\\n\\nFrom developer studio, Bombservice and directed rdein. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie metroidvania where you play as a young priestess named Kaho as she journeys to the eastern kingdom of Karst to stop a curse that has been corrupting nearby lands including her village. \\n\\n[h1]A Leaf and a Bow? [/h1]\\nUnique Gameplay\\n\\nThe game oozes with 2D bit aesthetics that are both charming and minimalistic. There weren't a whole lot of systems involved to remember. Except using a bow and your leaf to attack enemies, consumables option and even some handy items/spells you can use during combat. Each giving off a passive or active effect. Momodora doesn’t even take that long to beat with my playthrough clocking at just a little bit over four hours. With 99% map completion. The music, while subtle, helped give to life many areas you will visit throughout the map in Momodora. Yet it doesn’t overstay its welcome. There are plenty of save options nearby to save your progress and restore your health and consumables while on the go. Usually bringing up the map and going back to places you previously couldn’t enter is recommended once you gain a key ability that will allow the player to traverse into the new zone. Making backtracking a breeze and using new abilities to traverse is fun. \\n\\n[h1]Moving the Curtain Aside.[/h1]\\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\\n\\nTo my utter surprise I was quite captivated by Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. It’s been some time since I played a metroidvania game and I was hooked by how minimalistic the game details its world, inhabitants, lore and more without saying too much. While I would appreciate some more world-building to flesh out the game some more. I believe Momodora does an adequate job in selling the game’s premise to fans. There is no need to saturate the game further when it would break the balance and momentum of what the game already tries to convey to the player. Not much I can critique on the game, besides wishing for more music tracks. The gameplay was simple and effective by relying on the mechanics given at the start. Players can go deeper with combos in tandem to combat some bosses the game throws at you. In addition to some new abilities you will gain later on to help with traversal and combat. The story surprised me deeply and I couldn’t help, but be touched by the ending. Without any context, it goes into a direction I found fitting albeit one I didn’t expect at all. Still Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a must for newcomers or veterans of the metroidvania genre looking for something new, charming and short.  \\n\\nTotal Times Beaten: 1\\nScore: 8/10 \\nDate Finished: 5/21/21\\nDate Reviewed: 5/21/21\\nHours Played: 4.14 hours\\n\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Quick Description:\\n-Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th entry in the Momodora series and is hands down the most polished version of the series.  This is a cute, mini metroidvania that metroidvania fans are likely going to enjoy.  It's a one man team and is quite rough around the edges, but makes up for it w/ charm and engaging combat.\\n\\nWhat's Good:\\n-This game has a ton of charm.  There are a lot of cute characters and npcs all over the map.  Even some of the larger than life bosses are adorable looking characters.  I like the contrast between the brutal combat and the cute characters.  There are enemies that kill in 2-3 hits and spikes that instantly kill you.  You would never expect that from such an adorable looking game.\\n-I'm a big fan of the pixel art.  I like the way the bosses look, the impact when you hit enemies w/ your weapons, and when small star-like currency flies out of dead enemies.  The environment itself is serviceable, although not as polished as top tier games.\\n-The boss fights are hands down the most fun and challenging part of this game.  There are a quite few bosses in this 5 hourish game.  Some of small and agile, while others are very imposing and towering above you.  These bosses hit hard and are tough.   Memorizing their patterns and equipping the right powerups are key to victory.\\n-Lots of secrets to find.  I really loved exploring the world.  This is not that big of a metroidvania and the map isn't great, but traversing the world is still really fun.  You will be heavily rewarded for checking every square inch the map.  Some secrets are really obvious, while others are more obtuse.  Being able to equip more health potions, finding powerful relics, or simply gaining health can all be found if you search hard enough.\\n-You have a basic short ranged four leaf clover and a long range bow.  I loved that they chose a four leaf clover to be used as a weapon.  It's small things like this that make Momodora stand out.  You can unlock powerups that make your arrows poisonous or add flames to your attacks.\\n\\nCould Use a Few Changes:\\n-Very difficult during the first 2 hrs.  You are way under-powered and thrown into the deep in.  During the first 30 minutes, there are several enemies that can 2-hit you.  Even after the first hr, there are a ton of enemies that can 3 hit you.  There are also lots of instant death spikes to avoid while platforming.  This is going to cause a lot of players to give up before really enjoying the meat of this game.\\n-Pacing could use a lot of work.  I think this game would have benefit from adding one to two more areas and making this closer to a 8 hr experience.  Basically, as of right now, you spend your first two hrs dying left and right, then by the 4 hr mark, you become an incredibly overpowered tank that can brute force its way through almost everything.  If this game were a little longer, then they could have made the beginning a bit easier, and had a longer build up until you become extremely powerful.\\n-Most people do not enjoy one hit death spikes.  They are used quite a bit here, especially in the second half of the game.  There has to be more creative ways to add new challenges to the end of the game.\\n-Some areas of the map are kind of bizarre, and you can tell that this game lacks the polish that the best in the genre have.  You will also see quite a bit of duplicate enemies throughout the game.  Some enemies from the very beginning will also be at the very end in the same form.  This is not ideal imo.\\n\\nThoughts:\\n-I'm glad that I finally got around to playing Momodora.  I haven't played any of the other games in the series, but I've been told that this one is the best and most well rounded of the 4.  There is a final 5th game in the works which I'm excited to check out.  This isn't a perfect game but it's a competent metroidvania that fans of the genre should check out.  The dev was clearly inspired by Dark Souls and the challenging, methodical combat is one of the highlights of the game.\\n\\nConsensus:\\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  It's only $10 new but is an absolute steal right now while it's on sale for $4.  If you are scrambling to binge another metroidvania, than Momodora Reverie of the Moonlight is a fun one worthy of your time.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"The art direction and animations in this are my absolute favourites. The gameplay is also great. Movement is tight, and items are pretty useful, save for one or two. I also love the couple of rooms and side characters that give the world a lot more depth. It's a simple little game you can finish in an hour or so, unless you're going for all the secrets (there's more than you think). One tip: there's a body of water that has a ladder going downwards; you won't drown in that.\\n\\nPlus, it's a really good first game to get into speedrunning, if you're into that. The learning curve isn't steep, and the speedrun chiefly relies on you perfecting your movement. And as I've mentioned, movement is tight, so you won't find yourself getting frustrated over controls (unless you're doing rolljumps, but that's another story) . For whichever category you decide to do, the upper bound for your first run would be an hour and a half, and getting down to 30-40 minutes shouldn't take you more than a couple of further runs. And lastly, you get to keep seeing the art and animations.\\n\\nAnd yeah ha ha booba funni\",\n",

Lately, a terrible, terrible curse has spread across the lands, and the only way to fix it is for Kaho to travel from her homeland to the Kingdom of Karst to seek the aid of the Queen! However, not all is well in the kingdom.\\nMeet plenty of new characters in this short and tragic 5 – 20 hour tale! \\n\\nWhile Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is an adequate game, it’s really hard to say it’s any good until a couple hours in. Until you actually find upgrades and learn attack patterns, every enemy and boss can actually be pretty tough and will kill you if you don’t pay attention. Once all the upgrades are collected, the game is much easier, but the opponents stay exactly the same. Some of the enemies you find in the beginning are the same ones you find right before the final boss room and there really could have been a bit more variety. \\nThe biggest disappointment for me had to be the endings. While I’m not posting any spoilers about it, I probably wouldn’t have gotten the game at all if I had known.\\n\\nRegardless of all it’s faults, it’s not a bad enough game for me to not recommend it, and if you are interested in playing Momodora, I suggest either looking up gameplay videos or reading more reviews first.  \\n\\nTL;DR: It’s a decent game with subpar endings. Play it if you want.',\n",

If you love the genre, your enjoyment is guaranteed.\\nThe pace is relatively fast but never so much that you can get away with just button smashing. Furthermore there are some sections that focus more on platforming and offer a decent break from the fighting.\\n-There are upgrades, items and secrets for the player to find but not so many that you end up spending hours upon hours to find out what to do to progress the game.\\n-This was one of my first metroidvanias and I found it accessible and endearing. A great introduction to the genre.\\n-The art and the soundtrack both looks amazing. I wish there was an exploration mode where one can just go around and talk to the characters of this world -that is how compelling Momodora looks and sounds.\\n\\nThe Negatives\\n\\n-A bit easy during the first time one plays it. I died only a few times, all during boss battles and even those took no more than a third try.\\n-A little on the short side. I finished in 6-8 hours and I am but a newbie.\\n\\nThere has been real dedication in the making of this game and it shows. If you enjoy or are interested in metroidvanias, check Momodora out -it is worth full price and if you come across it's a steal.\",\n",

Yep. \\n\\nI don't think this ruins the game, but if you compare it to literally any other Metroidvania game, it starts to look a little janky. Only play it if you're already a big fan of the genre.

       "   'review': 'The TL;DR is: Combat is bad, enemy variety is poor, exploration is dull, almost no meaningful upgrades, and the bosses are forgettable.\\n\\nI want to preface saying that I got all the achievements for this game so I did spend an adequate amount of time playing it.\\n\\nIt\\'s fun enough to play, but is so burdened by flaws and annoyances that pile up into an overall rather unenjoyable experience. \\n\\nMap design ranges from annoying to downright poor design. The actual ingame map is poor, the entire map being just a bunch of red tiles instead of denoting a color for each major region. Additionally, it\\'s filled with numerous one-way paths that make you waste time looping around just to continue exploring if you had the audacity to pick the wrong direction first. Several of these one-way paths are impossible to get back to until you get a late game upgrade, and I use \"upgrade\" very loosely here. \\n\\nBecause for a Metroidvania, the game doesn\\'t really have upgrades. And I mean actual, gameplay improving upgrades letting you advance your exploration ability. The only actual upgrade that does *anything* for exploration is being able to turn into a cat. The problem is this does nothing actually beneficial for you--you lose the ability to make ranged attacks and can\\'t climb ladders (which are common in the game) so you have to spend most of your time as a human regardless. The only thing it lets you do that\\'s special is walk through tight corridors. Those corridors are few and far between throughout the game, like the cat ability was an afterthought. It\\'s as if the developer occasionally remembered they had to do something with it now and then, so they threw in a token room every so often where you have to turn into a cat for 5 seconds before doing platforming as a human.\\n\\nLike most games in the genre, the combat is fairly simplistic, with your options being a melee attack and a bow, along with a roll that has a large number of immunity frames that\\'s mandatory to use to avoid a lot of boss attacks. The combat, though, ended up being one of my biggest annoyances with the game through its poor design and inconsistencies. The melee attack consists of a simple three-hit combo, but the problem is each stage of the combo makes your character step forward slightly. The end result is numerous annoyingly positioned enemies either cause you to fall of a ledge into spikes (which kill you instantly), or cause you to step forward and take contact damage with the enemy you\\'re hitting. \\n\\nSometimes. Sometimes you take contact damage. That\\'s half of the inconsistency in the combat, you sometimes take contact damage from touching enemies, Sometimes you don\\'t! Whether or not you do is based on if the game feels like it. The other half is damage output from enemies and bosses, which has no consistency whatsoever. The same attack can do a massive variance of damage to the point where the damage values feel completely made up and just use a random number generator. As an example, one boss always starts by dropping a lightning bolt on you. Across dozens of observations, the exact same attack at random did barely a pixel of my life bar, a third of it, half of it, all but one pixel, and outright instantly killed me. Exact. Same. Attack. The *entire* game is like this--your life bar is just an imaginary number and the game decides you live or die from an attack based on completely arbitrary values.\\n\\nBetween all of these problems, I ended up just spamming the bow for the near entirety of my playtime. There\\'s nothing tactical about this because you can\\'t move and use the bow at the same time, but the bow was blatantly designed as the superior weapon in the game; the majority of passive equippables and required upgrades in the game buff the bow, the melee attack gets absolutely nothing unless you go out of your way to make it slightly less awful, and you can\\'t do that until shortly before the final boss.\\n\\nThe boss fights themselves were at best acceptable, and at worst just downright annoying due to the combat mechanics. Your character cannot jump very high, and most bosses are the same height as you, with the end result being that if they pin you in a corner you WILL take contact damage trying to escape. Rolling is less useful as half the bosses have erratic movement such that rolling will cause you to take damage regardless. Overall, due to the fact you don\\'t get any meaningful movement enhancing upgrades in the game and no alternatives or real upgrades to your attacks, the boss fights are pretty forgettable HP sponges where you spam the bow until they die.\\n\\nExcept they, for some reason, gave all the bosses special drops if you can beat them without taking damage. Half of these are items you can buy from a shopkeeper slightly later in the game, giving you a small power boost earlier than expected. The other half are exclusive items that are hilariously gamebreaking, capable of tearing through 30-50% of a boss\\'s life in one use (and you get up to 2 uses of each gamebreaker item). The funny thing is all the bosses kill you instantly on Insane difficulty, forcing you to beat them hitless, giving you guaranteed access to all these gamebreaking items that let you crush the bosses without challenge. If the combat and movement systems were good in the game I\\'d accuse this of being cheesy and lame, but the bosses feel like such a waste of time that I fully advocate cheesing them. \\n\\nI\\'ve never played the other games in the series, and that isn\\'t a problem with regards to the story and characters because the game has basically no story or characters. There\\'s an evil curse, you need to cleanse it. End of story. There\\'s like five characters you meet a single time, trust you immediately, and either tell you completely obvious observations about the game world (everybody is dead or a ghost? Wow couldn\\'t have figured that out based on the ominous music and all the ghosts I\\'ve killed so far) or just hand you a key item. Only one of these characters even has a name, which just feels weirder. There\\'s a few other completely worthless NPCs who say equally useless statements like \"I\\'m scared\" that don\\'t add anything. \\n\\nAnd, finally, the game is short. That\\'s probably one of the biggest upsides to the game, in that despite its stockpile of annoyances that incited me to make a review in the first place, it didn\\'t last long enough to make me actually hate the game. It\\'s barely 4 hours long, and that\\'s on a first playthrough that got the true ending, all upgrades, and full map exploration. You can casually speedrun the game in under 40 minutes once you know where to go. Momo4 at its core being a short game is also the root cause of other problems, like how few upgrades the game has. Can\\'t pace those well when you can beat the game blind in a single sitting.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s not offensively bad, not unplayable, is acceptably fun, but the problems with combat, lack of upgrades, dull exploration, and forgettable boss fights really dragged down my opinion of the game. But the game is often cheap on sale so it\\'s still decent for a couple bucks.',\n",

I would prefer a mushroom or fireflower for all the protection it would give me. \\n- Animations look nice, but feel awful to control\\n\\t- Swing animation is stiff and pushes you so far forward that it often puts you inside enemies or potentially into hazards/ off cliffs.\\n\\t- Doing any action after a roll is delayed. You need to roll perfectly to make sure you don't receive any damage, which is annoying when there is more than one enemy on (or off) the screen.\\n\\n- Many death pits/spikes that make this game a chore to play, some less obvious than others.

Turns out, quite a few.\\n\\nWho needs endless farming and complex crafting systems, zillions of spells and items or a HD graphical sheen? Just hand me some intuitive controls, nice animations, moody atmosphere, melancholy music and a map to fill in, and apparently I\\'m good.\\n\\nThe backgrounds in particular really stand out here. Not only do they look good for their style in a superficial sense, but there\\'s also a real unifying artistry that helps them punch well above their graphical weight. You get the impression that the authors have a solid picture in their heads of this strange world of theirs. It comes across in the coherence of whole aesthetic, as well as the eccentric little touches--the cats, the the ringing bell save points, etc.--that combine to lend extra character.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard people use the term \"souls-like\" to describe the combat, although in this case all that really means is that you have dodge sometimes and maybe think a little bit before swinging your weapon. \\n\\nOh, that weapon, by the way? If I understand it right, it\\'s some kind of magical leaf, which I\\'ve gotta say is definitely a first.\\n\\nYeah, don\\'t ask me why that is. I guess this game doesn\\'t require a whole lot of explanation, which is a good thing since they don\\'t really give you any. Like everything else here, the story is pretty minimal.  You\\'re some kind of magic nun or something who shows up in a cursed land to cleanse it of evil by swatting the dark queen with her killer leaf, and, uh, that\\'s about all I got. \\n\\nBut hey, just goes to show that it doesn\\'t always take a lot.  A tightly-made little game with a strong basic design and a bit of creativity and some signature flair can have an outsized impact.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in a nice metroidvania-style sojourn in a well-crafted setting--and who wouldn\\'t be?--you\\'ll probably walk away happy from this one despite their best efforts to the contrary.\\n\\n\\nYou can find more indie game reviews at [url=https://oddlittlegames.com] oddlittlegames.com [/url] or visit my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34514756/] curator page.

       "   'review': \"Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (Aka Momodora 4) is the 4th of the Momodora series.\\n\\nThe game is basically the same as Momodora 3 but with quite a lot of graphical updates as well as coding upgrades. The biggest visual change is the protagonist grew to 2.5 tiles height, far higher than the 1.5 tile of Momodora 1 and 1 tile height of Momodora 2 & 3. But the basic engine of the game seems to be the same as Momodora 3 (& 2).\\n\\nThe changes are, there's 2 playable forms of Kaho in this game, the human form (2.5 tile height) and the Kitty form (1 tile height). This enable certain hidden and secret area that are only reachable by the kitty form and certain places that can only be access by human form.\\n\\nThe basic battle is almost the same as Momodora 2&3, with a few changes. They've restored air dashing and double jump to the game. They've added an equipment table to the game, so we can now equip the items we found in game. \\n\\nThe coding improvements also allowed certain graphic layout to be possible, making the game more beautiful than the previous series.\\n\\nAs for the story, it's certainly an upgrade compared to the previous series. Both story and story telling shows huge improvements. But still, not up to the professional standard yet. Just enough to keep the plot intact. They've tried to put some meaning to the previous series in this one. Adding Eri (from Momodora 2) suggesting Momodora 4 is from a timeline before Momodora 2. Kaho herself made an appearance in Momodora 3 as a NPC, so this is somewhere after Momodora 3. But still... it doesn't really matter as even when they tried to link the time line, the story isn't related and player will not miss a thing if they didn't play the other series.\\n\\nLike Momodora 3, this one here has multiple ending. As well as secret areas and hidden items to collect. So completionist can have their fun doing the collection hunt.\\n\\nFrom Momodora 1 to 4 we can see the slow improvements of the games as it gets better and better. Hopefully one day, they will be able to produce some professional ones as Momodora 4 is almost there.\\n\\nFor those who stick with the series since 1, of course you won't want to miss out this one.\\nFor those who are new to the Momodora series, you can play this one without playing the others. But still, give the others a try, 1 & 2 are free on their website.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I feel bad because overall I liked this game and enjoyed the experience, but don\\'t think I could recommend it for most people if it was any more than the current four bucks.\\n\\nPros - \\n+ Lovely music\\n+ Cute art style and character design\\n+ Quite good atmosphere most of the time\\n+ Bosses are fun \\n\\nCons - \\n- pretty sluggish gameplay until you get some upgrades, that you dont get until like a third of the way through the game, which really doesnt take that long because...\\n- The game is really short, like I didn\\'t complete the game or anything, but I took my time, got most of the stuff and got the true ending and it took less than five hours\\n- Enemy scaling is really off. you see the same witch enemy after leaving the tutorial area (which by the way, the tutorial consists of mostly enemies that inflict poison on you) is seen literally throughout the game and you see one just before the final boss. The game felt pretty unfair until I got some upgrades, then it just felt pretty easy.\\n- The game doesn\\'t seem designed around only having manual saves at certain locations. With most traps or pits in the game instantly killing you, exploring is really stressful as any character interactions, items you picked up, map you uncovered, etc. is lost if you die and you have to do them all over again. I came back to the game after several months, beat a boss, and came across a lake. I proceed to go \"huh, is there swimming in this game?\", walked in, fell through, and died instantly and had to do the boss all over again.\\n- The games story just feels like a skeleton. I haven\\'t played any of the previous games but it kinda sucked when [spoiler]The MC just kind of unceremoniously dies at the end, and the game is like \"and she was barely remembered at all..... :)\" like really? Also, why does the weapon upgrade that is required to get the true ending just kinda slapped in a well with no mention by anyone whatsoever and no buildup?[/spoiler]\\n- The MC\\'s goddamn idle yawning animation. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s cute, but it really needs to be disabled for a little after boss/story segments. Nothing kills atmosphere like narrowly defeating someone you are meant to feel bad for fighting, seeing the person you killed fade away, not realize you have control again and the MC just step back and yawn like \"what? that\\'s it?\" like, what is your character again? \\n\\nOk so overall, I\\'d say the art, music, characters, and world of Momodora are wonderful, but from a mechanics and story standpoint the game falls really flat for me. If you enjoy metroidvanias and want a game to chill with for an afternoon, you might like the game, but I really wouldn\\'t recommend it beyond that',\n",

       "   'review': \"I recently finished this game after looking through my steam library for games that I hadn't touched, and I found it extremely enjoyable.\\n\\nThe game-play was responsive, challenging, and highly rewarding. I chose the Hard difficulty for my first run, and finished the game in around seven hours. Every time I got a game over, from a boss, or a common enemy, or from platforming hazards, I found myself determined to succeed the next time I tried - I just had to try again, and again, and again until I got it right.\\n\\nFor me, the game-play is the biggest draw this game has - that's not to say that the other factors were lacking though. The art, the music, the world, and the way the story is presented were all deeply enthralling. I'd also have a hard time trying to point out a significant number of flaws in the game, there's nothing negative that really comes to mind. Next, I'll be trying the Insane difficulty and attempting to get all the achievements.\",\n",

If you liked Minoria, then consider getting this game. If you haven't played either, then I recommend Minoria as being the better of the two.\\n\\nThe Good: Pixel graphics and music are great, the controls are tight and responsive, the fantasy setting is imaginative too. The game is quite brief [my first run lasted 4 Hours 20 minutes], but there is new game+ and other challenge modes to satisfy even the most soul's-thirsty masochist.\\n\\nThe Bad: low monster variety, combat is simplistic [dodge, stunlock, kill], the minimalist story that would make Dark Souls seem overly detailed, characters were forgettable.\\n\\nThe Ugly: the challenge modes are linked to the steam achievements [even no deaths], so don't expect to 100% this game.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"After finally Perfecting the game (100% achievements), I had better write a review. \\n\\nThis is one of my absolute favorite games and I can't recommend it enough. I don't know if everyone will get the special feeling I do from this game, but even if you have a more casual interest I think you'll enjoy it.  It's cute, short, and made very well. To me, the game is basically perfect and I have no complaints whatsoever. It's one of the first games I've speedran and it's the first real game I've Perfected.\\n\\nIf I look past the emotional attachment I've gained for Momodora over the years I still think it's a beautiful game. The traversal is fun. You get a variety of skills and powerups in Metroidvania fashion (more Castlevania than Metroid) and several of them affect how fast you can move as well as allowing you to explore and progress. The combat is simple and even trivialized by some of the powerful items, but the difficulty levels are very well tuned so you can have the challenge you want. The simplicity is redeemed by being polished to very satisfying levels. The art, sound design and music are fantastic. It succeeds at being both very cute and somber. The writing for the story, lore and characters walks the line of telling you just enough to have a solid foundation while leaving a lot up to the interpretation of the player. As you can tell, every aspect of the game follows the trend: less is more. It works because it's so cohesive and polished. It could feel empty or basic, but the mood is just right and you'll become much more invested than you would expect.\\n\\nMy save files suggest that you can expect 5-6 hours from the game at minimum, which is already worth the price tag. The game doesn't feel short. I think it's very replayable (and speedrunnable!) and you could get a LOT more out of it.\\n\\nShout out to halfcoordinated! Life is both a gift and a challenge.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"If this were an SNES game, it'd be considered a cult classic by today's standards.  A clear Metroid-like game, moreso than many that have come out recently.  It's not too long, nor is it overly burdensome with story/dialogue.  There are secrets to find, but it's not a difficult game, but it's a solid romp.  Good controls, music is a bit unmemorable if you beat bosses and try not to no-hit them.  Some design quirks I disagree with, but nothing that makes the game unplayable or broken.\",\n",

       "   'review': '[h1]Introduction[/h1]\\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight (RUtM) is a metroidvania (2D platformer with sprawling map that encourages backtracking once your character earns powerups) where you play as Kaho, a priestess tasked with saving her land from a curse. You traverse various castle grounds in search of the queen\\'s help, wielding your magical leaf and bow, gaining magical items and meeting characters along the way. The game is the fourth in a series, although you don\\'t have to have played the previous games to understand this one.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nWhile your main weapon (a magic leaf) stays the same throughout, so much of the game is about smooth and satisfying combat. Each encounter is an awesome acrobatic romp, as you vanquish evil with well timed dodgerolls, quickly fired arrows and a good whack of your leaf. \\n\\nAfter about an hour on \"normal\" mode, I played the rest of the game on \"hard\" mode, which was a good balance between challenge and stress. Most situations could be navigated through with a little determination and careful planning, and the variation in magical objects and loadout to use definitely added to the fun. When the difficulty ramped up with the boss fights, you were challenged to understand their patterns and attack accordingly. At most moments I felt powerful and threatened at the same time, which was an amazing balance. Again, I cannot understate how smoothly the combat plays. The only critique I have of this aspect of the game was that [i]sometimes[/i] the hitboxes felt a millimeter or two off, but for the most part they were fine.\\n\\nThe enemies and bosses varied in interesting ways, and the exploration of each map area was interesting as well. \\n\\nIt should be said that the game is shorter than your average metroidvania. I was surprised to check my map after a few hours and see that I had already covered 40% of it. That said, it doesn\\'t really detract from the quality of the game - and the calls to replay it on \"insane\" mode (with only 1 hp) or with a pacifist run, speak louder than most games given the enjoyability of the combat and movement.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nThe story reminds me of Dark Souls (doesn\\'t everything?). The characters don\\'t say much, although they do say enough for you to connect with the overall downtrodden and derelict mood of the game. The mood and exposition are compelling and they do drive the player forward through twists and turns, which end up jam-packed in this short game. Like Dark Souls, much of the lore is stored in item descriptions, for those who are interested. \\n\\nThe characters are interesting, though this aspect does suffer slightly for its preoccupation with an anime girl aesthetic. For instance, it is a little embarrassing or distracting when the chest of one of the bosses reacts to the swipes of your leaf. But for the most part the anime girl aesthetic isn\\'t foregrounded, and there is also something to be said for having a cast of interesting female characters who mostly aren\\'t sexualized. \\n\\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\\nThe pixelated art of this game is beautiful. It isn\\'t exquisitely detailed, but it is worth looking at and is distinct all the same. Each section of the map was a vibrant (or deliberately not vibrant) area that I looked forward to exploring.\\n\\nThe only critique of this aspect comes along with the previously mentioned critique, there is occasional unnecessary sexualization of the cast of female characters, but, again, this isn\\'t too significant, I would say. \\n\\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\\nThe audio here is the extravagant seal on this 16 bit love letter. All of the sound effects are delightful saw waves and square waves. And the background tracks for each boss battle and map area, while not staying in the 16 bit style, are [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXGdHu1b1fg]evocative and encompassing[/url]. \\n\\n[h1]Technical & Other[/h1]\\nIt took a while to set up the proper resolution of the game, and occasionally the were issues with audio, but these issues weren\\'t significant.\\n\\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\\nMomodora: RUtM is a fun little metroidvania. It is short, but a treat to play given its satisfying combat, and was only helped by its compelling story and characters. I urge you to play it and give some enemies a good 3 hit combo of the magic leaf.',\n",

It's short (<5 hours on first playthrough) but a great little adventure, especially if you get it cheap. Additional difficulties offer reasons to come back and I actually WILL because the game is so refined and satisfying to play. If you want a cute 2D Dark Souls platformer and you're tired of Hollow Knight, go for Momodora: RUTM.\",\n",

However, if you're a fan of both Dark Souls like games and Metroidvania's you'll probably enjoy this.

       "   'review': \"It's a pretty nice metroidvania game albeit on the short side. Took me maybe four and half hours to reach the final boss and another hour to go back and 100% the map and grab all the main collectibles before finishing the game. I found the environmental visuals and the level design in the game to be pretty good, and I like a lot of the enemy designs too. There's something oddly captivating about one boss in particular, Lubella, that really managed to draw me in. The addition of the [spoiler]cat sphere, allowing the player to transform into a cat[/spoiler] was great way to switch things up a little bit and everything felt really smooth and good playing that way. Generally the game controlled pretty well, and the oomph behind your hits is satisfying, but I did feel the melee combat could be a touch clunky at times with often accidentally bumping into enemies and taking damage while stepping forward to attack. To finish off, the last boss was kind of anti-climactic. Both in presentation and difficulty I'd say they were outdone by bosses prior, but especially difficulty-wise. Altogether it was a fairly fun game that I'd absolutely recommend checking out.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"tl;dr: fun game with a handful of design blunders. unbind your melee button after you beat frida. wouldn't replay. good value at $10. bow feels like an oversight because of how strong it is, enemy mechanics and stages are built around the melee.\\n\\nother reviews have the good, so let's focus on the bad: the core of my issues with the game is that the game shines during boss fights. exploration is not the focus of the game - the game is more combat-oriented than something like hollow knight. i don't know if this is a fair statement to make given that i've only done one playthrough of momodora and a handful of HK but given how the game pushes you into using degenerate speedkill strategies in order to acquire loot from bosses and how ALL of the trash enemies besides one enemy, in the **tutorial** of all places, are complete pushovers with the bow makes me stand firmly on how i feel after playing around with the ingame systems.\\n\\n1) boss drops are really powerful and are only obtainable when you flawless them (excluding Edea's Pearl), so cheese burn strats / persistence is the name of the game. this is a design issue on its own given the scarcity of items in the game (max 16 actives in inventory, 17 passives in inventory) because other items don't compare. this issue becomes amplified when coupled with boss loot conditions. boss items allow extremely easily speedkill strategies using the bow and items. i was able to melt the final boss's 3 health bars in roughly under 30 seconds while active.\\n\\nthe game doesn't tell you about this method of loot acquisition either (I only found out because I wanted to see if I could go underwater after beating up milky machine and her adopted child - spoilers, I didn't save), and thank god it's a short game or you have heavy incentive to abandon your save game and try again from the beginning when/if you figure it out. most bosses have save points directly before them, with the exception of frida and discount ornstein and smough.\\n\\npocket incensory and bakman patch are by far the worst offenders of this, considering you can get them both early since the game is non-linear. you get those and necklace of sacrifice and you've basically won the game already. tainted missive's additional two stacks from generic anime waifu protagonist lets you proc the necklace without additional setup, allowing you to oneshot almost every common enemy in the game. the other powerful items that aren't from bosses STACK with this, allowing for really high damage multipliers (roughly 4x damage at low HP, and you want to be at low HP all the time during bosses for easy resets if you fail the loot condition)\\n\\n2) persistent contact damage makes several bosses unpleasant to fight, specifically the crow boi. there are two ways to offset contact damage in this game - stunning the enemy temporarily makes them do no contact damage, or don't use the leaf. bosses gain stun immunity after a certain amount of hits and may win trades since the leaf is slow and has small range - BUT you can deflect SOME projectiles with it.\\n\\ni hope you like ranged weapons, because the bow is easily the best weapon in the entire game when you're playing casually. the leaf by comparison is borderline suicidal with a pretty bad return on investment because of occasional soft counter-attacks in melee range, lack of passive item support and forced movement when slashing. git gud and/or use the bow. i ended up resorting to using missive + necklace + bowspam + bakman to quickkill every boss after i got tired of fennel counterattacking me during my third hit of my combo because i didn't want to spend a ton of time mastering how to roll away from her, only to get hit by her teleport contact damage OR rolling into her because her sword hitbox takes up a fourth of the screen, and you can't jump over it either. i then pulled out the godslayer greatbow and shot her in the head 5 times and had a major anticlimax, because she's a fun fight despite all the asspulls of getting hit ONCE and having to retry. it feels like the game is balanced around speedkills because enduring some of these faster fights is not feasible after a few minutes.\\n\\ni don't enjoy using the bow - enemies are not built around it aside from the few that are immune to bow damage (lol). i used the leaf for the majority of my playthrough on hard and made it take much longer by extension. as soon as you get the first boss drop, the melee attack becomes objectively bad and after you get more ranged support then your leaf becomes a nice trophy in your key items. if you opt for using the megashark or magic builds when you play terraria, you probably won't mind this. as a stubborn melee user, i'll get my teeth pushed in for no reward other than for the fun of doing it.\\n\\nin conclusion, the way bosses flow make me feel like you're intended to use both melee and ranged damage to defeat them, but their mechanics incentivize playing at range and invalidating wanting to play as fennel but with a leaf because of contact damage. why even give me the option to use melee?\\n\\nif I were to fix this, i would add boss refights that drop their loot at the end of the game or have bosses always drop loot in the main story, with speed adjustments to punish playing at range.\\n\\nedit: also the level design is somewhat questionable but people have already read through this much so i won't elaborate further\\nedit 2: i went to look back vs fennel and apparently you can jump over the sword twirl, i just jumped too early and it's pretty precise. the teleport still catches me though, need way more practice roll cancelling.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Momodora RUtM is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The previous three entries in the series, while very pretty in their own right, have nothing on this game. (By the way go grab Momodora's 1 and 2 for free off the developer's itch.io and then grab 3 for two buck here on steam, they will take you an afternoon to beat). Anyway Momodora 4 is the perfect culmination of the best element from previous entries (metroidvania map from 2, equippables from 3) refined and expanded into a game that is as fun to play as look at. The only downside is the length. While the longest in the series by a large margin I still blasted out a playthrough in 6 hours. That said I immediately started a second play to find more secrets and generally just experience the damn thing again. I have a system where if I get one hour of playtime per dollar spent on a game then it was worth the money so you will still probably get your money's worth. Doubly so if you get it on sale.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Literally last week did I finally try out Momodoro III. I had it in my steam library for the longest time but never found the chance to play it until recently. I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed the game, so I went back and found the first and second games which I played through as well, making me further appreciate the polish and love that went into the third game. This game, however, was supposed to be the last one.. and it was!\\n\\nMomodora: RUtM ended up being a very enjoyable experience, despite a couple of originally poorly left tastes. I\\'ll get to that.\\nWhat I want to say now though is that for 10 dollars? Hell yeah, get this game. No doubt about it, you get your money\\'s worth. You get your money\\'s worth and then some if you do happen to get it on sale.\\n\\nNow the gameplay of this game is very simple. Attack with a leaf, attack with some arrows, and roll. That\\'s all there is to the main mechanics. You\\'re able to spice things up with passive items that affect certain things regarding money, attacking, etc. There\\'s also active items which recharge on every ring of the bell, so you never feel pressured about stocking up on something for a helpful pickmeup since it works around replenishment. Otherwise, there\\'s just a big map to explore, plenty of bosses to fight, and enemies to beat up that stand in your way. I enjoy the combat despite the simplicity. That single 3 hit swing is satisfying to pull off, and unlimited use of range moves to a separate button separates this game from III as the superior in range, since it\\'s so easy to just create a projectile. \\n\\nOne of the biggest changes, and seriously, I can\\'t emphasize this enough... that I appreciated was the change to bosses from Momodora III. For every Momodora game before this one, bosses always felt... poor? Like, the challenge was there, but for some reason, bosses in the prior games did not randomize the move they would do next. You always knew what was coming and when they would break for you to attack. I never liked that because it was less about reaction times and more about repeating steps until victory. In this game, the attacks are randomized in execution and bosses, for the most part, are attackable whenever. It instead goes for a proper balance of mixing when to dodge to when to attack, and that felt so much better instead of waiting for the same moment again and again.\\n\\nNow there are two major gripes with this game. Both of which I fell victim to because... the game sure as hell doesn\\'t tell you. One: there are boss items you can get. BUT. The catch is that you MUST beat them without getting hit. This isn\\'t even something I would have thought to try unless you told me there was something out of it. On top of this, if you beat a boss and do get hit, the item you get from that is lost permanently for that run. I don\\'t like it when games put a super high risk like this for a reward, because you\\'ll often find that built in stuff now has no utility if you want these items. Heck, there\\'s an item that increases your attack by 100% temporarily for the cost of some health. But guess what? Self damage during a fight still counts as taking damage! There\\'s also a ring that increases damage when low on health. Also useless, because you\\'d have to get hit in the fight to even trigger the effect! I hate that. \\n\\nNow, I should say that beating the bosses without getting hit isn\\'t particularly hard. It isn\\'t easy either though, and you\\'ll find yourself getting frustrated because this idea of not getting hit conflicts with the idea of the game. The items you get for beating bosses without taking damage aren\\'t necessary by any means, but that doesn\\'t exactly make me feel any better about how they\\'re locked away by a conflicting mechanic.\\n\\nThe other issue? This one is dumb, seriously. There is a unique shopkeep within the game that has one condition to decide whether it appears or not. If you break this condition, you will never know he even existed. This guy sells unique stuff only he has too, and that is a good way to make someone mad when they find out later. Unless, of course, you don\\'t even look up a guide. Then you\\'ll never know he existed since nothing tells you!\\nWhat\\'s the condition? There is a spider that shows up in the first area. He\\'s the only one that looks the way he does (other than the unique shopkeep) and is the only non-boss enemy to have dialogue. Now, it\\'s dialogue is \"Uguu...\". Okay. Don\\'t know what that means. Might as well go talk to him, right?\\nBAM! You take damage by walking into him! So he\\'s an enemy! Kill him! \\n\\nBut no. He\\'s an enemy, but one that, if you kill, never reappears and you can\\'t access the shopkeep anymore. If you wanted me to keep him alive, game, why do you make him hurt me? That\\'s incredibly misleading. Whatever. If I had one other minor gripe, it\\'s that you could easily miss the item that lets you warp around until late in the game if you don\\'t know where to look. Go through the area that requires diving underwater first when given the option to go multiple ways. Once you get a new ability, then go back to the place where you started. This will be very helpful!\\n\\nReally though, those are my only gripes with the game and they\\'re not even that big. The game is somewhat short if you don\\'t go for everything, but I recommend going for everything since it makes the game a lot more enjoyable. I really wish that the idea of making the next Momodora game 3D wasn\\'t scrapped as I would have really liked to see how it transitioned. I hope this won\\'t be the last game in the series, because I\\'d love more of the gameplay that III and this brought to the table!\\n\\n(Also get Momodora III)',\n",

One thing I really like is the organic way you're moved through the map. You'll be on your way to one destination but find yourself discovering a whole new part of the map all together.

       "   'review': \"MOMODORA is either a mini-troid or a tuff-as-nails adventure game depending on your skill and difficulty settings, but how does it taste? Well, the combat is fun and light, the platforming is strong with good map design, and it has definitely got solid game-play balance with some lovely (if simple) design to boot. [i]Bonus points for playable cat[/i] (because it really is fun).\\n\\nThe story and theme, however, feel a little odd. The music and the setting try to be Dark Souls, but the parade of anime dolls and the bouncy pink blocks feel like... something else. And it's hard to get into the story when the main protagonist is a silent stranger and the other characters literally don't interact in any way. I like what it's going for, but I never really bought in.\\n\\nStill, for $5.oo it'll give you a nice escape for a weekend. If you can't get enough of these quick-n-dirty adventure platform games (like me) MOMODORA will feel right at home in your collection. ★☆☆\\n\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Very good game, and worth paying for. This game diverges from the previous Momodora games, which were more linear and similar to Cave Story. This time it's more of a metroidvania. The world is very atmospheric and fun to explore, and has a Touhou-esque cast of anime girls. The art and animation are also very high-quality. \\nJust a warning, though: this game is pretty easy on normal difficulty, and pretty short. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though. The shorter length makes the game more suited for multiple playthroughs, which based on the steam achievements is something that the devs probably intended. Also, given the game's low price the short length isn't really an issue.\\nIf you're wondering whether this is a good place to start, this game is a prequel to the other games and you don't really need to have any knowledge of the previous games's stories. The first two games are freeware, though, so there's not really any reason not to play them. It's just not required.\\nI recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of atmospheric exploratiion/metroidvania but not necessarily into hard-as-nails games, and also anybody who's a fan of anime girls and cats.\",\n",

[i]Apparently[/i] you have to upgrade your magic leaf at this random windmill thing in order to win the final fight. When you walk up to the windmill, all you get is a picture of a box with no indication as to what it means or what you're supposed to do.[/spoiler] So the ending really felt anticlimactic to me. \\n\\nAside from that, the gameplay loop is great, and most of the bosses have very balanced difficulty. It should only take you a couple tries to beat most of them.\\n\\nAlso the art is insanely beautiful.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'So after 100%\\'d this game, I\\'ve decided to write this review.\\n\\n[b]Overview[/b]\\n\\nTo me this game seems to be a combination of Castlevania and Dark Souls, and a good one.\\nThe gloomy atmosphere, non-linear (metroidvania) gameplay, and Souls-like combat (maybe more like Bloodborne).\\n\\n[b]Art and Music[/b]\\n\\nThe pixel art is very well done, especially since the animations are smoothly hand-drawn, very pleasing to the eye.\\nAnd then the music, while it may not be the greatest, it does the job right, and some of them are quite memorable, especially the Pardoner\\'s Dance. I feel like a lot of people might agree that Fennel\\'s fight is the best part in the game.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay/Combat[/b]\\n\\nNormally, I don\\'t like metroidvanias that only has 1 type of main weapon. Although there are few exceptions, and one of them is definitely Momodora. The combat is satisfying enough to keep you entertained, you\\'re only equipped with a leaf (that plays like a sword) and a bow (which you can charge to shoot more arrows), either you want to play all melee, all ranged or mixed it\\'s all up to you, and of course there are items you can use to change your playstyle a bit. And just like other Souls-like games, dodging is important.\\nOverall it\\'s just fun to play.\\n\\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\\n\\nAt the beginning, you get to choose a difficulty, Easy, Normal, or Hard. \\nI\\'ve never played Easy but Normal was very well balanced for a first playthrough, until you get to a certain point where you\\'ve collected a bunch of Heart fragments (extra HP) and Bellflower (healing item), a lot of bosses would be too easy to beat, on my first playthrough (which was on Normal), most of the bosses are beaten after 2nd try, even the final boss wasn\\'t hard to beat.\\nI\\'d still recommend playing on Normal for a first playthrough and replay on Hard for a 100% run.\\nAlthough if you want a challenge on Normal I suppose you can go for the Imperishable and/or Pacifist run (never actually tried a New Game+ so I\\'m not sure if it adds difficulty or not, probably does).\\n\\nOn Hard there are extra enemies in some maps, and your Health is lower, sometimes you\\'d even die in one hit, but I feel like this is the difficulty where the game meant to be played on.\\nWhen you beat the game on Hard, the Insane difficulty will be unlocked, where everything basically just kills you in one hit, in the description it only says \"Don\\'t even try this\". I mean it\\'s up to you if you want to do this or not, but to me this was actually fun, I usually get frustrated when games gets too difficult but thanks to the fun combat, I don\\'t feel that at all.\\n\\nBut perhaps it\\'s not only about the combat, but also the save point placements. When you\\'re about to fight a boss, you don\\'t have to face like hundreds of enemies after leaving the save point, some of the save points are also placed right besides the boss room, so this game is quite kind on that matter.\\n\\n[b]Royal Pinacotheca[/b]\\n\\nYes I\\'m making an entire section dedicated to one area in the game. \\nMinor spoiler warning.\\n\\nThis area is accessible after you\\'ve obtained all 4 Crest Fragments, and to me this is just the Blighttown of Momodora. I mean it\\'s not that bad, but, I remember dying a lot in this place, maybe I\\'m just bad at the game but still. On top of that this game has the hardest boss in the game (in my opinion), Lupiar and Magnolia.\\nDespite all of that this is probably the most memorable place for me, probably a nightmare too.\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nOverall I just love this game, especially with the art, gloomy atmosphere, and satisfying combat. Fennel best boss, and screw you Royal Pinacotheca.\\n\\nI\\'m giving this game a 9/10.\\n\\nThank you for reading this.',\n",

       "   'review': \"what a charming adventure. I had a great time exploring the nicely designed and varied paths. I liked the small taste of freedom in the early to mid-point of the adventure. The story kept interest and the characters' motivations surfed upon it like a batch of california raisins. Even some of the baddies had respectable depth.  I thought limiting the weaponry and using items/charms were well-implemented choices, but, being a wizard myself, I would have liked to see more spells (small gripe). I played on hard and it kept me going! Looking forward to the sequel.\\n8.5/10\",\n",

       "   'review': \"What I'd like to see: \\n- Different areas on the map being different colours. When you're hunting down the final bits and bobs it's tough to know which save point to warp to because it's all jumbled together as the one colour. Take a look at the in-game map design of Blasphemous. The sewers are brown. The ice mountains are blue. The woods are green, and so on. It makes looking at the map SO much easier on the eyes. \\n\\nThe animation is absolutely fantastic! Especially for Pardoner Fennel. \\nA solid experience. It's nice to see this series evolve from Momodora 1 to 3 then this. This is like the culmination of everything we've seen so far and then some more. It's the most similar to Momodora 2 with the open map exploration, unlike 1 and 2 which were linear and a more arcade-y design. This is definitely the right way the series needs to go. Great soundtrack. Art reminds me of ib. Game is trying to be Dark Souls but feels more like Blasphemous (which was trying to be Dark Souls). \\nIn summary, once again, a great game from rdein. Very little to pick at, other than what was mentioned above (which really isn't a criticism but more like a suggestion for some quality of life that's easily updated with a patch. Also, extra points for zettai ryouiki and boob boss)\\nLet's hope we see Bunny Swordmaster in the next one!\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I did enjoy this game, for what it is, but I don't recommend it.\\n\\nThe reason for this is simply that the overall standard of the game is not at a high level, despite some aspects being very good. It looks like a game developer learning the ropes. It is clearly inspired by the Metroidvania genre, and makes a good attempt. It survives by keeping things quite simple, and it's quite an interesting game if you have an interest in game development.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good attempt at a Metroidvania, and there are a lot of positives. But I can't recommend it without the caveat that expectations must be kept low.\\n\\nPositives:\\n- Retro art style is quite beautiful in some areas, particularly the backgrounds in the forest.\\n- Music is nice and creates an atmosphere.\\n- Combat is generally good fun, and the bow and rolling works quite well.\\n- Warping and many save points alleviates some frustration\\n- Map is good enough to get you through\\n- Cheap when on sale, and not a bad play if you set your expectations low\\n\\nNegatives:\\n- Overall lack of polish\\n   - The map is very basic. Some indication of different areas would have been less frustrating.\\n   - The jumping/swimming sprites are static\\n   - The level design wasn't great. The only items that helped you progress were keys, and all locked doors looked the same, regardless of the key needed.\\n- The story telling is extremely poor. Who the characters were, what they were called, what was happening, all of this was absent. Things happen to characters, and I don't know who they are and don't have any reason to care.\\n- Everything in this game seems to be an anime girl with cat ears. I'm sure anyone who can make those lovely backgrounds can design more consistent and original enemies. Screenshots of Lubella should have been sufficient warning.\",\n",

The length is perfect. It adds a lot of replayability for the game. This, coupled with the dozens of secrets to find, including bosses, makes every playthrough of the game strategic, and lets you plan what you want to do in this run. I myself am not a fan of metroidvanias. at all. but this game makes me want to play over and over again. \\nNow that the fifth in the series is on its way, i feel like it\\'s the perfect time to play this, the fourth one. \\n\\nat its WORST i would give this game a 9/10, but as a whole, i give this game a 10/10.',\n",

The achievements are hard to receive as well, but at least got some trading cards. I'm replaying it for the second time now and hopefully getting a good ending since my first attempt failed. Overall nice game, cute graphics and charming music, REALLY reminds me of Undertale *felt like if Undertale was a platformer*... but still I can't imagine playing in a harder mode :)\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Momodora is one of those games that you enjoy playing from start to finish. If you like metroidvania gameplay and repeating trial-and-error gamestyle. Yep. This game is must buy. For people who are unsure about those two. It can be little frustrating when you get an item after 4 minutes of gaming and then you noticed that your life is low. Now you need to backtrack that same 4 minutes + additional minutes for the closest bell. If you can\\'t or you get cheap shot\\'d in your way. Tough luck. Game takes everything what you had collected and then just asks you to do the same twice.\\n\\nIt\\'s alright when you get used it, but I feel like the bells placements are sometimes too far apart. Yes, you can collect those Health Herbs on the game, but sadly those sometimes deplete so fast that the game just forces your deaths sometimes.\\n\\nGame\\'s story is pretty meh. Nothing special and feels mundane D&D style, \"Go and kill this person\" -type of quest. Controls in other hand feel awkward. 50% of my deaths was because I accidentally either pressed Item Selection, Bow or Dash instinctly. My finger would have been pretty sure that  Back Trigger [ L2 and R2] -Buttons should for cycling items. Left Trigger [L1] would be for item activation and Right Trigger [R1] for the bow. Dash and Item activation doesn\\'t change on the control menu unless you reroute your controller\\'s macro buttons from the Steam menu. Which can be a hassle for people who just wants to re-map their preferable control method.\\n\\nGame is solid three hour fun, but there is too much unnecessary deaths. I would have played it more if there was additional content in it after last boss. [spoiler] Secret Boss - not worth for trying it [/spoiler]',\n",

You can play as a [spoiler]cute cat[/spoiler]!\\n\\nBut it doesn\\'t feel like a metroidvania - unlocking new ability doesn\\'t lead to whole new sections of map, only if linearly, and there\\'s not much reason to ever backtrack (making all my efforts feel like waste of time).\\n\\nBoss fights are simple and aren\\'t any what memorable, except maybe the slightly \"lewd\" one - just for the unusual hurtbox location. On a contrary, regular enemies hurt a lot, and there\\'re also annoying insta-kill spikes/pits.\\n\\nOnce you die, everything since last checkpoint is reset so you need to pick up recent secrets again..\\n\\nAs of story, maybe there\\'s a lot of hidden stuff, but casually reading all dialogues left me with impression that the story can be summarized in one short sentence.\\n\\nOverall the game feels.. hollow.\\n\\nI can only recommend to grab the game when it\\'s on sale if you wanna run in a pretty and simple platformer, just don\\'t expect much from the game beyond its looks.',\n",

I just (as of 9/27/2020 at 4:30-ish PM) finally 100%ed it. It has been a go-to game for me to play while I'm waiting on other people or if I'm twitch streamers. Also, got the True Ending on Insane difficulty. If you do combos appropriately, you can be VERY powerful. Somewhat want to do one last run and not use the bow or any spells, but if I do, it DEFINITELY wont be on Insane Difficulty. Probably on Hard.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Gameplay - This is a tightly coded Metroidvania in the classic tradition. Explore, fight, gain new abilities, etc. It varies a bit from the usual formula by mixing in some Soulslike elements, notably a Eustice flask style healing system.\\n\\nThe controls are extremely satisfying (essential for this genre). You rarely feel like you\\'re waiting for an animation to finish.\\n\\nGameplay is overall about 7-10 hours, depending on how thorough you are. Personally I\\'m delighted that it\\'s short. Longer games can easily overstay their welcome.\\n\\nMy only real complaint is the map. It would\\'ve been nice if the map regions were labeled, and nicer still if we could\\'ve added our own notes. The warp ability doesn\\'t let you pick any save-point, just one per region that\\'s pre-designated.\\n\\nPresentation - Retro pixel art style. The overall presentation is a mix of dark and cute. It serves decently, and provides a good callback to other Metroidvanias. There\\'s a few interesting vistas, but most of the tilesets are same-y. This isn\\'t a game I\\'d recommend on art alone, but the art does add to the experience.\\n\\nThe protagonist is female, which is good, we could use more games with female leads, and while her animations are a bit cutesy, she\\'s at least never sexualized.\\n\\nSpeaking of goofy sexualization; My only complaint is the Witch of Decay. You get into several fights with this enormous witch... and her breasts. Seriously. They have their own impact/jiggle animation. It\\'s completely out-of-touch with the rest of the game\\'s presentation and tone.\\n\\nStory - Minimalistic and pretty typical for this kind of game. The kingdom has been cursed. Go face the source of the curse and either defeat or free them from it. It\\'s more of a framing device than an actual plot. That said, I appreciate that it takes itself seriously. Indy projects too often aim for \"funny\" plots instead of serious ones. The writing is rarely up to the challenge.\\n\\nInnovation - There\\'s nothing new here, but what\\'s been included has been refined to a razor (leaf?) edge. Momodora is a good example of how a game doesn\\'t have to innovate to be worthwhile.\\n\\nConclusion - A nicely self-contained Metroidvania that\\'s absolutely worth your time IF you\\'re a fan of the genre and looking for more of the same. Definitely skippable if you\\'re not a Metroidvania fan. If you\\'ve never played this style of game, then Momodora is a great entry-point. It\\'s short and highly accessible, which can\\'t be said for all games of this type.',\n",

       "   'review': 'A short, though charming little game. Momodora is a prequel to an indie game series about priests, witches, and undead powers. I had previously played Minoria before this; a spinoff inspired by the series, so I was familiar with its Metroidvania-esque gameplay, combat system, and atmosphere. I think this game is a little slower, and less challenging overall; but it has some of its own appeal in its environments and straightforward design. Minoria had a totally different artstyle, though it used some of the same motifs, and whereas I think that worked really well, the pixelated areas and characters in this game still look great. The story isn\\'t anything special; and the music is pretty good. \\n\\nEssentially it\\'s just a 2D timing/attack action game, where you have to dodge correctly, choose between range and melee, and navigate a simple maze. There\\'s some unlockables on the way, but I find that some of the sorceries aren\\'t useful, or don\\'t come into practice until the final hour, so you mainly just rely on your bow and \"leaf,\" which acts sort of like a sword. One of my favourite elements is you can turn into a cat, but there isn\\'t that many puzzles, and I found the game to be kind of easy outside of boss fights. Even then, there\\'s enough healing items that if you do get hit, you can kind of power through combat. I\\'d generally recommend you play on Hard, unless this is one of the first games of the style you\\'re attempting. \\n\\nIf you have a craving for sprite adventures, this is an excellent game to pick up; and though it won\\'t last a long time, it\\'s polished enough that it may draw you into the series, or inspire you to tackle other games in the genre.',\n",

       "   'review': 'A really good game that’s worth it’s price.\\n\\n[h1] =Overview= [/h1]\\n   Kinda difficult controls, simple story with astonishing art and an amazing soundtrack. The overall atmosphere set by it is one of a souls-like game, coming around with the theme pretty nicely, making a pleasureful experience.\\n\\n[h1] =Story= [/h1]\\n   Not much to talk about this one, the hero is confronted with a problem, goes on an adventure to solve it, fight some people and then… problem solved! [spoiler] Or not? [/spoiler]\\n   In short, a priestess from a far away land goes on a journey to stop a curse that’s plaguing her home. \\n\\n[h1] =Art & Audio= [/h1]\\n   Beautifully made pixel graphics for both characters and backgrounds. The NPCs and PC are well designed, having their own highlight on the game levels. Animations are a strong point for it, none of them seems wacky and are super fluid.\\n   The impact that the soundtrack has on overall gameplay is undeniable. More than once it helped to emphasize the mood of the area or encounter, the audio effects play an important role on it as well. Momodora RUTM’s ost is pleasant to hear not only in game but also out of it, ranging from lively and tense songs to calm and depressing ones.\\n\\n[h1] =Gameplay= [/h1]\\n   Oh boy! Something I can’t forget to say is how awful the keyboard controls are for this game. Unless you have no bones on your fingers, a controller is highly recommended. It could be better if it had mouse support; The attack, use/change item, jump and dodge buttons being so close doesn’t feel nice and are often very confusing.\\n   The game presents you 4 difficulties, providing from casual to hardcore experiences. Changing how hard the game is don’t seem to change the enemies, only the player, lowering or increasing health and letting you regenerate it over time with equipped items.\\n   Melee or ranged, combat is good, bad thing is that you can get hit if you’re too close to an enemy or boss when attacking. It really improves itself by using the items the game gives you, especially during boss fights, those are really cool but, on the other hand they could have used of a bigger attack pallet.\\n   All achievements can be gotten by the second play-trough, although it can be challenging. It really disappointed me that some enemies are able to enter boss rooms, which could fairly easy ruin some runs.\\n   Don’t having a linear obligatory way to progress trough and having the ability to warp between save points are a nice touch that’s worth a mention.',\n",

You will die a few times, especially if you're trying to defeat bosses without taking damage so you can get special items.  Definitely recommend.  Game has best balance of difficulty when played on hard mode since you can still get one-shot, but not by every single enemy like you can on insane mode.  Insane difficulty is a lot of fun too though, but I can see how it would be frustrating to some.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Beautiful game.\\nThe pixel art is breathtaking, and the gameplay is tight. The music is atmospheric and haunting, and the world is very isolating.\\n\\nThis is a nice, though short Metroidvania. You have your map, your short ranged and long ranged weapons, and a few key items to create a slightly customized build. There are some nice secrets to find, and the exploration is fast and rewarding. Movement upgrades don't make you go crazy and zip around the map, but they offer you a way to mix up your attack plan and evasion tactics.\\n\\nThe game pulls some clear elements and inspirations from the Souls games, however it is nowhere near reaching that level of difficulty. Enemies and bosses are very telegraphed, therefore learning to beat them is quite intuitive and easy. It is very comparable to the normal bosses of Hollow Knight. It all pulls together in a nice and very fair challenge.\\n\\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good Metroidvania, though be warned that this game only takes a few hours to finish nearly to completion. There are multiple difficulties and challenges, so that may keep one occupied.\",\n",

It tastes like obligatory anime fan service, mostly so the artist can have some sex appeal on the poster and we can have giant tittied woman who's tits you have to smack around for a while.\\n\\nbut seriously, you get to be a cat so it kinda makes up for this. All games should allow us to play as the cat.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I was given this as a gift.\\n\\nIn advance, I don\\'t hate the game. I don\\'t think it\\'s bad. Unfortunately, I don\\'t think it\\'s that great either due to a lot of weird/bad design decisions, a bit of missing polish and the fact that it really didn\\'t need to be a Metroidvania. I don\\'t really care to play the harder difficulties as a result because I think these issues compound into a game I just find frustrating. I find it overrated and was very disappointed when I finally tried it after seeing all the praise, but if you like it, more power to you.\\n\\nFirst off, the combat has some issues.\\nWhile at first the melee seems pretty nice and weighty, with every move pushing you forward - the cracks start to show when you realize the game has contact damage and it\\'s really easy to get knocked out of a combo just from that. While it looks like for the most part staggering an enemy with a melee hit will stop it from contact damaging you, if anything\\'s nearby that wasn\\'t staggered, it\\'ll hit you out of your combo. You seemingly get no i-frames, even during your finisher.\\n\\nThis is especially a thing during the final boss, which doesn\\'t seem to stagger - you\\'ll try to wail on her and you just get knocked back for no good reason. Most humanoid bosses do stagger, but they can break out of it too. This wouldn\\'t be so bad - I\\'m used to it from playing KH2FM - but the problem is that damn contact damage. It\\'s usually not a lot, but it\\'s still frustrating. You really just have to shorten your combos or try and judge the distance you can use a finisher on some of these.\\n\\nThere are no real aerial combos either, so after a while I just ended up saying \"screw it\" and used ranged attacks for most of my damage. This leads to some of the taller bosses just getting really stale and repetitive (like, again, final boss) because all you\\'re doing is hopping and hitting over and over and over.\\n\\nSecond - the other main problem I have is that this game just really didn\\'t need to be a Metroidvania. It\\'s kind of a Fusion-like - there\\'s not a ton of interconnectivity and exploration involved. It\\'s also a bit more like an Igavania, with kinda obtuse secrets that\\'ll leave you constantly hitting walls with your leaf. I don\\'t mind either style of \\'vania, and I think it\\'s just the execution that matters.\\n\\nSo unfortunately, I really didn\\'t feel like exploration was all that rewarding - the damage is so high even on normal that health pickups kind of felt pointless, a lot of your equipment is either bought or gained from flawless boss fights, and there\\'s only really two upgrades that gate your progress (ignoring the actual shards themselves, which basically make up a key). It takes really damn long to get a fast travel ability - while the map isn\\'t very large, it\\'s still large enough to make backtracking to far away areas tedious.\\n\\nThe level design also does a few things that just really don\\'t make sense to me. There\\'s a few dead end rooms that seem like they would have something there, but don\\'t. There\\'s also a couple of these rooms that have water in them that will kill you if you fall in - which makes zero sense when the game has a water level that lets you dive right in without so much as an oxygen meter. I also have to question why there\\'s instant kill spikes in a Metroidvania game with sometimes pretty long stretches between save points. Usually, MVs with instant kill spikes have some kind of grace element that makes these deaths less painful - Ori 1 had checkpoints you could make yourself, and Mega Man ZX (not one you hear often I bet) had a lives system.\\n\\nThere\\'s other nitpicks I have but I just wanted to get my main points across and that\\'s it really. I feel like a lot of the problems I had with the game just carried over into Minoria from what I\\'ve seen, which got significantly less praise than this for whatever reason. I hope that the next Momodora game that was just announced learns its lessons from this, Minoria and its peers to win me over. Otherwise, this is why I just didn\\'t enjoy my time with Momodora: RUTM.',\n",

This medtroidvania is just too frustrating because of the stone age design of the save points, the outdated designs made for boss dialogue handling and save points placements, and the clunky combat.

       "   'review': 'Rating: 3/5\\nThe game is too short and not worth the price. Wait until it\\'s on sale. \\nTotal gameplay 1st time was about 4hours on normal. \\n---------------------\\nPros:\\nPretty, if you\\'re into 2d artwork\\nMusic, while nothing memorable it was very atmospheric at times. \\nPolished, it is complete with some minor replayability and new game+. \\n-------------------------\\nCons:\\n\\nShort. Way too short. \\n\\nPower scaling was off balance. The beginning, while I was getting used to controls was by far the hardest. Comparatively, end game, when I\\'d finally learned the game, felt breezy easy and too short. If you\\'re looking for \"dark souls\", look elsewhere. \\n\\nCombat: Either snipe out of bounds or get in close before they hit. Little variety in how you approach combat. Often I would get locked in a swing animation and would be unable to turn around quick enough. Not having a down jump attack is something you\\'ll regret not being given.\\n\\nBosses could be accomplished in under five times. Very easy and they could be summarized as spam bow from the corners. Also, I\\'m not sure if I missed it, but there was no lore for half the bosses...they just appear at inconvenient times. \\n\\nLore, I\\'ll admit, I didn\\'t play the first three and I felt like I was severely missing a chunk on the protagonist\\'s back story. If you\\'re looking for \"dark souls, no questions answered\" kinda lore, look elsewhere.\\n\\nItems and money: Unless I ground a ton, I never had enough money to buy all the new item/buffs. As I progressed I kept feeling like I had to go back and buy out the merchant...but I was never given the chance.\\n\\nBacktracking: Warp comes in way too late in the game and most of the time you\\'re just wandering between health upgrades trying not to die before reaching the next save.\\n',\n",

I will probably be doing a 2nd Steam playthrough at some point as I do with a lot of PC/PS4 games.\\n\\nNow the actual game itself is fairly short in comparison to other metroidvanias however the pixel art and animations in this game are really clean and the music itself is very relaxing. (White leaf memorial park especially.)\\n\\nI don't really have much else to say though at the very least I have been enjoying the game so far.\",\n",

In this game you play as Kaho, a young priestess, that is looking for the source of a curse so that she can destroy it. While traversing the areas you will have a leaf (the primary attack, your melee weapon), a bow, and various items/spells (that you purchase from a merchant or find as treasure) at your disposal. This game offers four difficulty levels, making it approachable for nearly everyone; However, there are some relatively minor sexual themes so you might find inappropriate for children.\\n\\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\\nThis game is absolutely stunning looking. The areas, bosses, and enemies are all very diverse and beautifully done. There are quite a few different areas presented in this game (from the woods to the chapels and castles), and the amount of different enemy types is impressive for such a small game. [spoiler]Lubella and Derelict Frida are two particularly beautiful bosses[/spoiler]. The animations are super smooth and wonderful to watch as well. The whole experience just looked exceptionally polished.\\n \\nOn top of looking the great, the game [i]feels [/i] great. The melee combat has such a wonderful weight to it that is just so satisfying to me. Finding ways to work the bow in to combos was really fun, and experimenting with the different items/spells was also really rewarding. The items added a wonderful modern element to an otherwise relatively simple game. The bosses were all pretty exciting to fight; I particularly enjoyed fighting [spoiler]Pardoner Fennel, Lubella, and the Queen[/spoiler]. Combat aside, the movement in the game felt just right; tight, and not too slow or fast. Once you unlock [spoiler]the ability to turn in to a cat[/spoiler], you can traverse areas a little bit faster. The checkpoints were really forgiving, and teleporting around also made the size of the map totally do-able without being overwhelming. I also really enjoyed the concept of defeating bosses without getting hit to get extra rewards. The four difficulty options make sure that just about anyone could play the game and enjoy it, and personally, I found Insane (the hardest difficulty, where you die in one hit) to be the perfect challenge for me.\\n\\nThe story in the game isn't very exciting, but I also don't think it's really that significant to the experience. This game borrows a little from Dark Souls (the checkpoint system reminds me of it, unlocking the ability to teleport about halfway through the game, and various other elements like some of the items you can use), but it definitely doesn't have nearly as serious of a story. You are basically just playing as a priestess that is on a quest to [spoiler]defeat an evil Queen to prevent her from destroying the world. In doing so you end up sacrificing yourself for the greater good[/spoiler]. It's very cliche, but that is standard for action/adventure games. I suppose I should mention that [spoiler]there are two possible endings (a good ending and a bad ending). As far as I know, the only thing that really matters is whether or not you upgrade your leaf before you defeat the final boss. If you upgrade the leaf you will unlock a third boss phase and the good ending[/spoiler]. The writing in this game definitely doesn't escape the shadow of the visuals, gameplay, or music.\\n\\nThe music is just great. I particularly like the tracks House of Cinders (the opening is extremely atmospheric and kind of reminds me of a broody Dead Can Dance song), Pardoner's Dance (it's just beautiful), and The Lovely Queen (it's so intense and retro). I actually listened to the OST after finishing the game just to take in the music a little bit more and it's a pretty great soundtrack that adds a lot to the experience of the game (the Pardoner boss fight is so much better with that track playing). The sound design is also really great, with the combat and movement sounding wonderful and making everything just come together so well. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this game (to everyone, but particularly people who enjoy retro games or metroidvanias), especially at such a low price ($9.99 is truly a bargain for this game). My first playthrough was around three hours, with subsequent playthroughs being under an hour. In all four of my playthroughs (one on each difficulty) I didn't experience any bugs or issues. I did receive this game in a bundle.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Fast, fun Metroidvania. Doesn't overstay its welcome. Solid soundtrack too. \\n\\nChallenge is pretty much just right for me. There are frustrating moments, but it's easy to stop, strategize, and try something new, and the difficulty rarely feels cheap-you can identify your fuckups and know how to do better next time. For better or worse, I 100%'ed it within 20 hours, but it looks like the game has a bit of a cult following, and you could definitely cook up your own challenges involving items and playstyles. The English translation has some weirdness, but the story's still clear enough. \\n\\nOne wacky caveat that I managed to miss is that this is the fourth game in a series. Chronologically, it's the  first, so you don't need to play the others, but I was almost done with this one when I found out, and normally I like to play a series in release order. So consider yourself warned if you actually care about that kinda thing\",\n",

       "   'review': \"The only strong positives I can give for this game is that it's entirely functional with consistent art and themes. Everything seemed to work properly. Otherwise, a completely forgettable metroidvania experience: there's nothing here that stands out from anything else in the genre. There's little enemy variety which makes trudging through areas a slog of repetition. You have two attacks which never change throughout the course of the game, making the backtracking un-fun compared to other games in the genre that juxtapose your present abilities against what use to be challenging to deal with. Design choices that slow down gameplay such as not having a minimap, an item bar that only has 3 quick slots but can be changed out at any time by pausing. There isn't a strong narrative, character development, mysteries to investigate, or other internal motivation to drive your actions other than 'I want to beat the game.' Additionally, it's incredibly short, and the difference between the 'good' and 'bad' ending is picking up one item at the end that requires a slight bit of backtracking.\\n\\nLastly, there is a section that requires you to go underwater to progress. Until this point, jumping in water was an instant death. I explored the entire map searching for a hidden ability or passage to continue, only to find that there was one place that you could enter the water without dying. As far as I could tell, there was no in-game information to express this was the correct path. This was disappointing for someone that enjoys exploration games. Not only that, but, once in the water, you have infinite air and can 'swim' by jumping as much as you want. Knowing that, why even make water hazards before this that instantly kill you if the water is harmless otherwise? It's a strange design choice to be sure.\\n\\nIf you're looking to get into a game in the genre, this might be an ok starting point, otherwise you won't find much substance in this game to keep you invested. You're be better served to play Symphony of the Night as far as AAA games go, and perhaps Death's Gambit if you want to stay indie.\",\n",

To start out, as per usual with this developers games and the Momodora series, touching an enemy deals damage and I will never agree with that, it only gets worse with the difficulty going up in the game. The insta-kill spikes are also a huge turn-off, as they are in the other games. What I found amusing was a underwater level, but every other aspect of water in the game is instant death. The boss fights can be grueling due to the fact they take so long, you just don't deal a decent amount of damage unless you have certain items which a majority you get from completing perfect boss kills which are /also/ difficult. I thought I was mind-boggled at the hard mode, well when i got to insane mode, I was just about ready to close the game and walk away, which sometimes I had to do to take a break before coming back. The only positive note I can say about this game that I adored was the fact you get cursed into being a cat and can switch forms.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Personally not the biggest fan of Metroidvanias but the stellar pixel art really sold me on this one. I'm glad it did because paired with the music, it generates a beautiful setting; this game has a nobledark aesthetic and nails it. On top of some (Lord forgive me), 'Souls-like' mechanics, exploring and boss fights were quite fun. One in particular, [spoiler] Pardoner Fennel's fight [/spoiler], I really loved. The story ain't half bad either and I was thoroughly invested by the end. 100% exploration/completion doesn't feel tedious and you are rewarded as you uncover the narrative piece by piece. After playing I can still personally say that the art is the main selling point of this game, but its other facets live up to that standard. 9/10.\",\n",

The others, the third is available on steam for almost nothing, while the first two are freeware.\\n\\nThere is a decent amount of challenge to it and there is a lot to discover. It is rather short though, with a single run lasting possibly under 10 hours to 100%. But there are a few additional challenges and modes to unlock. The gameplay is rather souls-like, with dodging being very important to survival, since even normal mode will kill you in 2-3 hits if you aren't careful, but you do get an assortment of items to keep you healthy.\\n\\nFor those wanting to get everything, a few pointers:\\n\\nYou get bonus items for beating bosses without damage.\\nThe Insane difficulty (one hit deaths) is unlocked when you beat hard mode.\",\n",

Makes it so you actually want to use you damn items! ^^ The game doesn't do anything crazy and while being a metroidvania you mostly get to new places with help of keys. It's not a bad thing! In a shorter game like this it can be nice to get to know how your character just works without getting new upgrades thrown at you :P Only critique i have would be that it feels like you exploit the invincibility frames of your roll to get through the entire game :o Making lot of combat a little 1 dimensional. Still a super solid game over all and would recommend to most people since i think most gamers would enjoy a well rounded metroidvania like this! :)\",\n",

       "   'review': \"While this short and simple metroidvania has some tight gameplay and nice pixel graphics, it somehow ends up feeling less than the sum of its parts; that is, while it is clearly the work of an indie developer who has their hearth in the right place, it still lacks that refinement that games done by more experienced have.\\n\\nDespite that, I can still recommend it (specially if on sale) for a short bout of action platformer. I'm a metroidvania veteran and completed the game in about 5 hours with the true ending by colecting all the secrets. Be warned tough that this game is deceptivelly challenging and will certainly provide some pain for the more casual players, who might perhaps be more well served with some of the bigger and more polished/approachable other metroidvania games out there.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"8/10\\n\\nA fun and well done metroidvania game.\\n\\nFollowing from previous Momodora games, RUTM maintains the pixelated art style but with some changes - mainly on how characters look, with bigger sprites and more detail. The game is also different in the sense that it's more of a metroidvania game, with less linearity involved. It's also considerably longer than previous games, though still quite short for a metroidvania game, being able to be finished in a few hours.\\n\\nThe soundtrack is quite good and the game looks and plays great. The game's only downfall is the difficulty, which feels unbalanced - I ended up restarting the game on Easy after trying out the game on Normal, since after the first area, there is a huge difficulty spike that makes the game feel a lot more frustrating than it should actually be, and some bosses can kill the character in very few hits.\\n\\nCharacter progression could also have been a lot better for a game of this genre - there are health upgrades that can be obtained, but the health increase is very small. Certain bonuses can also be found during the game, but they're required to progress through the game anyway. Also, only 2 passive items can be equipped at any time, which severely limits options for upgrading the character.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great game and it's also very cheap, but it could have been a lot better if these issues were addressed.\",\n",

The ability to use both melee and ranged attacks since the beginning is quite neat, since it offers more options in the way you engage in battles. The bosses are also fun, despite having a pretty small arsenal of attacks.\\n\\nMy only major problem is that the story was quite basic and short.

       "   'review': '2d souls like metroidvania. There\\'s the buzzwords.\\n\\nThis game is very souls like, in tone and in similar mechanics. I know you\\'re probably sick of \"souls like\" but you don\\'t bitch at \"rogue like\" now do you? It\\'s just an effective way to explain in the least amount of words, but I digress.\\n\\nPretty satisfying mechanics and gameplay, dark and brooding tone with interesting boss fights and enemies, varied and good looking environments, mysterious characters... It\\'s all good stuff, pacing is done rather well, exploration feels tense and rewarding, there\\'s a couple of endings, but not much choice or anything like that.\\n\\nThe boss fights are cool, but there\\'s this dumb hidden mechanic where you get a special item if you kill the boss without taking any damage. You could think this is a neat little thing for people who have already gotten pretty good at the game and want a challenge, but these items are usually pretty damn good items, and people who are that good at the game DON\\'T NEED EXTRA HELPING ITEMS. How hard is this to understand?? Why would you put a challenge in the game that gives players more power when the players who need that more will be the players who can\\'t get them? Not to mention the monotony of trying to kill a boss without being hit once, and once you\\'re hit just having to suicide and try again. It\\'s just a really dumb design choice that this game is not unique in making.\\n\\nOther than that, this game is quite good. Really good.',\n",

The beginning was hard, but as soon as I got used to it was a breeze, especially the bosses, that are telegraphed.\\nThe pixel art is well done and the music is decent.\\n\\nThe single problem I have with this game is that it was sold to me as a Metroidvania, and I think that part is lacking. Don't get me wrong, the game is really good, but I'm pointing out a design choice that is not the best, according to ME (personal opinion).\\nYou start off the bat with a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, double jump and a dash that can be used both on the floor and in the air. There is a single ability-gating upgrade, which is [spoiler]the cat transform, that lets you reduce your size[/spoiler]. Every other item you get is either optional or literally keys that open doors.\\nThe game does have an interconnected world and some backtracking, couple that with the single upgrade you and I guess we can call it a Metroidvania, but I am sure it would be even greater if the dash, double jump, and ranged weapon were acquired during the gameplay.\",\n",

       "   'review': '\"Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight\" is a fun but fairly short Metroidvania game that immediately reminded me of the web-series RWBY. \\n\\nI enjoyed the anime style graphics and picked it up on sale. Initially I treated \"Momodora\" as more of a hack and slash game but I quickly realized I was mistaken. \\n\\nEven on normal mode basic enemies kill you in only a few hits. The ability to roll through attacks was vital to kill even the most basic enemies. I came to appreciate the fighting since timing and attack recognition were necessary against the bosses rather than just raw firepower. \\n\\nMy main criticism of \"Momodora\" is that it\\'s a very short game. I\\'m terrible at video games and freely explored but with a walk-through (or even a better sense of direction) this game can be beaten in two hours and that isn\\'t including if you want to speed run it.  \\n\\nBecause the game is so quick to beat there isn\\'t much in getting upgrades. There are really only three upgrades and again since the game is so brief they\\'re pretty underutilized. \\n\\nIt\\'s a fun game and I don\\'t regret my time playing it but at the same time I did want more.',\n",

       "   'review': \"I've heard great things about this game, so I gave it a shot, but after experiencing it, I mostly feel frustrated by its design. There are enemies throwing things at you from out of the screen. Touching enemies hurt you sometimes, but sometimes not (I'm sure there is a logic behind it, but it's not clear to me). You can jump mid-air, but it's so tiny of a boost that I don't even feel like using it. Yet, it is frequently needed to reach some platforms, and since it is so tiny, it gets really difficult to make some jumps that should actually be trivial. I also had some issues with the controls. E.g., after using an item, I expected to be able to switch items right after, but it's not possible. I know I have to wait a bit to use another item, but I should at least be able to switch it whenever I want! I died a bunch of times to a boss, because this very thing kept failing me. The game is difficult, which could be a good thing, but I don't think it is difficult in a good way. It feels mostly like artificial difficulty to me. After many tries, when I finally conquer a difficult section, I don't feel like I earned it, or that I'm better at the game after that many tries. Instead, I feel like I just memorized where the enemies are, when they are going to attack, and I react accordingly. Even though I'm disappointed at this game, I'll give it another shot later.\",\n",

The setting is pretty fun though I never cared too much about the story. If I have a gripe about the gameplay, it is that the dodge is really difficult to time.  The game as a whole is just really tough. I don't think I made it through any areas on the first try. Some enemies are also really spongy which makes the excessive retries annoying. That turned out to be more complaints than I meant I guess. There is a lot more depth than I would have expected from the trailer and Gameboy Advanced graphics.

       "   'review': 'Momodora 4 lengthens the play time, improves the graphics, and cleans up the combat and over powered equipment from Momodora 3 and overall is a miraculous improvement (in most areas; more on that later). Momodora 4 is much more of a metroidvania than its predecessor but still fumbles the progression elements. Most of the main power-ups are not linked to progression and can be acquired in any order; therefore, for the power-ups that are linked to progression, the worlds optional areas are accessible in an uneven manner and discourage exploration. The inclusion of hitting random walls to destroy them without indication still remains a mechanic I believe is outdated but I do personally think neutral of the mechanic. For the positives, the world is fun to initially progress through and poses a mild challenge. The combat adds a three hit chain attack with the attack button and the same bow as the last game. All in all, a game worth playing but it did not knock my socks off.  There are clear areas for improvement and I cannot wait to try the next game by the development team: Minoria.\\nThe bosses left a lot to be desired. I would almost say the bosses are a downgrade from Momodora 3 but one boss actually left an impression on me that I will remember as one of my favourite bosses I have ever fought. The one boss I did enjoy ended up raising my excitement too high because the rest of them were disappointing. Some of the bosses were above average but the bosses worse than ‘above average’ were awful. So, I guess overall, a polarizing boss experience. I cannot responsibly recommend Momodora 4 for boss fighters but there is something to enjoy if you chose to anyways.  \\n',\n",

       "   'review': \"This is a fun little game. It has a certain charm, and the mechanics are straightforward. Overall, the experience is better than the gameplay itself, which can be a bit slow and floaty. First, the world is well thought out and charming. I could easily explore and enjoy what the world has to offer, and the unique flavor lets you know you're playing something that is in many ways set apart from the average 2D scroller. This brings me to the art, which is very well done in a similar manner. I find the different areas visually impressive, and while they bear a kind of simplicity they also feel alive insofar as the medium can allow such a thing. The sound design helps with this as well, and while the sounds of the world (voices, footsteps, attacks, etc.) are fairly average, the music girds this title with a sense of adventure. The gameplay is pretty classic in its concept, making it easy to understand and very straightforward, providing no barrier to getting right into the game. Also, points for control scheme customization. The execution of this gameplay, however, is where I feel the games comes up a bit short. I found myself heavily favoring ranged attacks simply because the close-up melee attack took so long to animate. The movement in general felt floaty, and made any attempt at precision a gamble. It was somewhat annoying interacting with an otherwise interesting world. I found myself having to slow myself down to the game's pace in order to play comfortably. Overall, if you're looking for a nice creative game to play for a while and don't mind that the inputs aren't as crisp as they are in some other games, I think you're in for a fun time. From what I have played of it, I give Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight a solid 6.5/10.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This is a very nice metroidvania game! It took a while for me to get into it, because I was stupid and chose the hard mode which is SPECIFICALLY NOT for first playthroughs. I thought I could do it because I've played things like Hollow Knight in the past, but take it from me and play it how it should be played the first time. \\n\\nThat being said, it takes a while to start unlocking areas and find useful items or permanently upgrade your moveset, but this is not as much of a problem for a shorter game.\\n\\nThe combat is fine, and mostly comes down to dodging and hitstun, so I wish there was a little more depth there. While there are various enemies, you pretty much deal with them in the same fashion: hitstun up close or spam/charge arrows at range.\\n\\nThe bosses have fair patterns and usually take a few tries. They are pretty fun!\\n\\nFor me the game is very enjoyable, I just have some nitpicks with it. It feels a bit unpolished in some areas. For some dialogue, there are unnecessary pauses. For bosses with multiple phases, they just kind of reappear awkwardly. The penultimate boss doesn't even have a title, what's that about? Some of the atmosphere is great like in Karst Castle, while other places have deadpan ambience. That's fine because the tone is pretty lonely, but it just feels out of place when other areas have fuller soundtracks.\\n\\nWith all that said, do I still like the game? Yes! I'm excited for the next one whenever it comes out. I think with a little polish and quality of life improvements it can be even better :)\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This is a solid Metroidvania experience with a fair learning curve, simple yet effective mechanics and a lovely aesthetic. The combat is basic yet flashy and fun to get the hang of. The level design is well thought out with plenty of secrets and hidden paths to reward players for their exploration. Most of the bosses, with one unfortunately unfair exception, are a fair challenge with some interesting attack patterns, and I really felt like I had got better at the game by the time I defeated the final boss. This isn't the greatest game I've ever played but its a consistent and enjoyable experience that those new to the Metroidvania genre will likely enjoy. Its only around five to seven hours long but for the price its understandable, and with a new game + mode I'm yet to experience and a few corners of the map still undiscovered I feel like this game still has plenty to offer me.\\n\\nMy only complaints: \\n\\nPardoner Fannel's boss fight borders on unfair at times, with her being able to change direction in combos and telegraph and make randomised attacks within my window of healing. I totally understand why her character has the movesets that she does yet I felt like this really pushed boundaries. A solid boss fight but I do have my issues.\\n\\nOther issues include a mismatch of tone on occasion, with the humour feeling out of place with how gloomy and dark the atmosphere of the game is, and sometimes the backtracking can get a little stale. There are also some issues with translation and grammar at times but these are very minor. Besides my issues with the boss fight these issues are minor however.\\n\\nOverall, a game I don't consider perfect yet overall one I can recommend to fans of Metroidvanias and platformers in general.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Lovingly-made Brazilian Metroidvania with heavy Souls elements. Top-tier soundtrack, and very atmospheric environments. Would easily recommend at full price to support the creators. A speedrunner's dream. In my opinion the best 2D interpretation of a Souls game to this day.\\n\\n[h1][i] +++ Positives +++ [/i] [/h1]\\n\\n+ Perfectly tuned difficulty - Played on hard, it is a very difficult game but never unfair. Every time I died I could tell what I messed up on and fix it. I play a lot of Souls games though, for a beginner I would even recommend going a difficulty down.\\n\\n+ AMAZING soundtrack, one of the few game soundtracks I find myself listening to when I'm not playing the game, especially the title and garden themes.\\n\\n+ Great boss design, they will one and two shot you on hard, but once you memorise their patterns in each phase and learn to dodge and use items to your advantage, you will get past them. No unfair RNG bosses.\\n\\n+ Items make your character faster, the game is non-linear and seems to encourage speedrunning a lot. Good for replayability.\\n\\n+ Decent amount of collectibles and secret walls to be found.\\n\\n[h1][i] Nit-Picks [/i] [/h1]\\n\\n+ The map needs a little more clarity. It did it's job well enough, but I still found myself running into brick walls when I thought I wouldn't by looking at the map. Needs to be labelled and the closed off entrances should be color-coded in my opinion.\\n\\n+ The second time (for me) you encounter one of the bosses, their attacks are a similar color to the background, which can make it hard to distinguish them. This is the only design problem I have with a boss in the entire game.\",\n",

It has a sprawling map, is fairly open ended, branching out into multiple different zones pretty quickly with no indication of where you should go next. Plenty of secrets sprinkled throughout the land, fun and engaging combat, fairly mysterious lore driven by in game dialogue. Reminds me of some old school games like Faxanadu or the original Metroid in terms of atmosphere. My only real complaint is that there aren't more achievements, and that some areas feature instant death pits which are holes that kill you if you fall down them, which is absolutely dumb in a metroidvania. Seriously though, this game is a perfect example of a 'vania done right.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a short metroidvania from Brazil.\\n\\nGraphically it's pretty pixel graphics, Kaho has pretty decent animations, in both human and cat form.  Some of the foes are a bit less detailed, but everything generally graphically works.  The reflections when near water look really nice, but sometimes get confusing as to what is the reflection and what is real.  A lot of areas are dark, and sometimes the foes and NPCs can blend into the background.  It's fitting for the story but it makes it easy to take cheap hits.\\n\\nMusic works, it's nothing special but feels appropriate for the game.  Sounds generally fit as well, though a few sound effects come in far too strong (certain foes when melee'ed or the spinning staff attack used by the cone hatted foes).\\n\\nBosses are well done, most attacks are well telegraphed.  This is important as defeating certain bosses without losing health (from poison, damage from the boss, or self-damage with items such as the Tainted Missive) will give you a special drop.  Some of these items can be duplicated or mimic'ed in lesser form from later purchases, others (such as the extremely strong Bakman Patch from Lubella 1) can be permanently missed for that playthrough and cannot be duplicated by any other items.\\n\\nNon-boss difficulty is pretty high throughout the game.  Kaho is not very durable without getting several vitality upgrades, many of which need cat form or air dashing to reach.  Early game when learning you will die a lot.  The earliest foes you meet are the most random and difficult to deal with, imps and witches.  Later you'll be able to handle foes better.  Spikes and pits are almost always 1-hit kills, and there are a lot of those in mid to late game.  Explore cautiously, and be prepared to redo sections often if you die.  Try to get as many Bellflower upgrades as you can.\\n\\nThe map is passable but not great, most rooms show up on it and there are very few completely secret rooms.  It does not show still closed doors or mark where items you missed are.  Be careful when looking at the minimap with Select on the controller (I'm not sure of the keyboard command), as the screen is NOT paused and enemies can still attack.  Looking at the map when accessed from the pause menu will let you check the map safely.\\n\\nThe Ring of Candor which you can purchase will do a chime when you enter a room if there is a secret passage or Ivory Bug in it.  Getting all the Ivory Bugs is extremely difficult as there are several really well hidden ones (in invisible hidden walls or ceilings), and they're only a few pixels in size.\\n\\nOverall, it's well worth the purchase if you like metroidvanias, especially if you get it on sale.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"While short, Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a game that kept me coming back to it. The pixel art is beautiful, the music is atmospheric, and the gameplay is tight. However, the story doesn't have enough time to develop in my opinion. You play a Kaho, a priestess from the village of Lun who has journeyed to the Kingdom of Karst to nullify a curse emanating from the kingdom. Along the way, you will fight enemies and meet a few characters. However, because the game is so short, most characters are only good for a few dialogues before they start repeating their script. While this is completely subjective, I would've liked to learn more about the characters and the world of Momodora without having to read text entries in the items menu. All in all though, it is worth your time to buy this game, and it is absolutely worth your time to buy this game if it is on sale or you like metroidvania games like myself.\",\n",

The games combat, bosses, and artstyle all combine to make a very powerful a tight-feeling game.\\n\\nThe bosses in Momodora 4 are outstanding, each boss feels unique, has a large yet fair amount of moves, and have easily readable tells. Player skill is rewarded uniquely, if you can beat a boss without taking damage, you get a special item. I enjoyed each and every boss and the ones in this game are some of the best in the genre. [b] DO BUY FOR THE BOSSES [/b]\\n\\nThe arstyle and animation are incredible. Seriously, the dev, rdien, outdid himself when he created this art.\\n\\nThe level design and map layout work perfectly together, there is no wasted space. The map is small, and the game time is short, but much like Gato Roboto this game uses every precious second to have you doing something useful, there is absolutley no filler. [b] DO BUY FOR THE CONTENT [/b]\\n\\nThe achievements were few but fun. A few were difficult to obtain, like beating on insane mode (death in 1 hit for almost all the game). Overall, I enjoyed grabbing all the achievements on this one.\\n\\nTo wrap it up, if you have overlooked this tight, beautifully wrapped mini-metroidvania with souls-like elements, then NOW is the time to buy it. I here the dev is already working on a new Momodora project which will be a day 1 buy from me.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[b] TL;DR [/b]\\n\\nMomodora: RuTM has gorgeuous art, outstanding bosses, and tight controls, this is one of my most highly recommended games!',\n",

Higher difficulties for those who want to do such things and actual achievements. Feels kind of like a slower castlevania with a dodge roll and items that recover at bonfi- I mean bells. The similarities to a dark game where you collect souls end there. It manages a good line between punishing decisions and being lenient on execution, but the instant death spikes are pretty unfun. Also, some of the hidden items involve invisible platforms or walking into walls. Even with the item that alerts you to secrets that felt pretty lame. \\n\\nIs it an amazing must-play title?

       "   'review': '[h1][u]Story[/u][/h1]\\nThe game\\'s story revolves around a priestess, named Kaho, who was sent from a different land to deal with an evil threat that creeps across the land. Other than that the story that takes place during the game is there but minimal so you won\\'t see much about it even as you play. They\\'ll get the base points of the story across but that\\'s about it.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\\nThe gameplay is good but can wear on some people as it\\'s the same for every enemy: boss or common enemy. Attack, roll away from attacks, attack, etc. There are some spells but overall the direct confrontation is better as it\\'s quicker to dispatch enemies. The bow is straight up the best thing as you\\'ll stay safe but the gameplay will become dull if you rely on it. Two items you find and buy later on are extremely good for the bow making it common enemy stomper. The item that adds fire damage to your attacks not only does that for the bow but also makes it stagger enemies (drops from the fire boss if you don\\'t take damage during the fight). The secret spider merchant sells an item to allow your arrows to pierce, when combined with the fire item, makes your bow the go to for killing common enemies and even dealing with around half of the bosses.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Difficulty[/u][/h1]\\nAll the difficulties up to hard are relatively easy to deal with if you proficient at side scrolling games like Momodora. The insane difficulty lives up to it\\'s name as you start the game with basically no life and even with all HP upgrades any direct attack from any enemy will kill you. When it comes to dying you can choose to \"retry\" or return to the main menu. If you choose retry it just dumps you back at your last save station and you continue on your way. It\\'s very forgiving when dying even on insane difficulty.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Graphics[/u][/h1]\\nThe graphics are pixel designed. That much is obvious even from the store page. I have a soft spot for these designs as I grew up with pixel games back on the NES and original Gameboy. The graphics of the pixel art itself is pretty nice. Not the best ever but it\\'s great to look at.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Audio[/u][/h1]\\nI didn\\'t have anything to dislike when it came to the sounds or music. It\\'s all nice to hear and works in unison with the game\\'s design. My only gripe is the death scream for your character Kaho is bit loud but that\\'s it.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Performance & Bugs[/u][/h1]\\nGame ran very smooth. Played it with a keyboard and didn\\'t have any issues with any input. The game ran without issue graphically and in general. I don\\'t think I even came across any bugs either or if I did they weren\\'t noticeable.\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Summary[/u][/h1]\\nOne of the better side scrolling pixel games I\\'ve played in the past few years and is an experience everyone should try if they like/love these type of games. It might not become one of your favorite games ever but it\\'s something you more than likely will enjoy from beginning to end.\\n\\n\\n\\n[h1][u]Notice[/u][/h1]\\nThis review, as with all my reviews, are my own personal thoughts and opinions on the game it is for. Whether I like it or dislike it / recommend it or not recommend it: it does not make it any more valid than someone else\\'s view on the title. I also will not review a game based on a score system as those review designs are flawed. This is from score reviews having a 0 and 10. A game can\\'t reach 0 unless it\\'s unfinished and unreleased and in that case can\\'t be reviewed. No game can be a 10 because that would indicate perfection and no game is perfect. There\\'s always flaws.\\n\\nIf I happen to like or recommend a game it doesn\\'t mean I\\'m blind to any potential flaws it may have nor does it mean I\\'m going to defend the company who made it. If I happen to dislike the game or not recommend it that doesn\\'t mean I hate the devs or the players who like the game. My reviews aim about the game in question and not the players who like or dislike it. If a game is bad enough I will heavily criticize the devs and company. Not every game is going to appeal towards each person of which applies to me as well and in no way is there anything wrong someone liking or not liking a game.\\n\\nIf the game I\\'m reviewing is an online game, be it PvP or PvE, please use [url=https://steamcharts.com/]Steam Charts[/url] to see how populated the game is. You don\\'t want to waste money on a title with no players in it. Just be sure to also take into account games that have crossplay like Microsoft titles. They usually have smaller player bases on PC but if crossplay is available then you generally don\\'t need to worry about a small PC player base.\\n\\nMy reviews might be changed down the line if something gets altered in the game that would warrant an update to said reviews. I may update my reviews as well if I feel they can be done better. If you got all the way to the end of this then thank you for taking the time to read it all.',\n",

It is a pretty short game, it took me about 5.5 hours, but I enjoyed it the whole time. The gameplay and controls can take some getting used to and I do recommend a controller, but overall I'd suggest it if you're a fan of metroidvanias with a bit of a challenge.\",\n",

From the art style getting an overhaul to the gameplay change to the large map I get to explore to the characters that bring this world to life, I love everything. Momodora 4 brings all the best qualities from the previous titles: The difficultly from the first game in the platforming and enemy placement, the satisfaction of exploration and finding hidden items in the map from the second even if it was small scale along with the npcs that bring the game to life, and being able to equip items to alter gameplay to your style from the third. Not to mention new game plus. The fourth game is a delightful mix of the strongest qualities baked into a delicious gamer cake.\\n\\nI legitimately struggled to find the one thing to nitpick. Sometimes when fighting multiple enemies I get hit because I’m stuck in animation from hitting them and I can’t defend myself. I can’t really think of anything else.\\n\\nFull Video: https://youtu.be/gsTofQIp2LI',\n",

It\\'s a huge waste of time. \\nHP increase doesn\\'t help gameplay at all, and there\\'s a bigger problem on creativity of enemies as well. If player died \"unreasonable\" then there\\'s a major issue with the game. Don\\'t expect us to experience Ninja Gaiden once more just to prove we are \"top-notch\" gamers. We\\'re not. It\\'s a new gen now, and it\\'s ok to look back to the old times, but make sure what to follow and what not to -- I mean, even Ninja Gaiden had some sort of FTR to prevent instant death and abadons the game. Why ain\\'t this game anyways? The same problem happens in Minoria, so do pay attention.\\nI do like the visual and would like to see more, so will finish the game afterwards.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Cons:\\nForget playing on Hard mode, Normal mode isn't even fun either, combat is the worst.\\n\\nThere are points in the combat where you are fighting an enemy, and you just randomly take damage without any hint of movement. You can't choregraph some of the enemies, and some of the placement of the enemies is really aggravating to deal with. (The main point of a shield enemy, is to dodge behind it and kill it, but they sometimes put a wall behind the shield enemy, and expect you to kill it. Tell me how this is great game design?)\\n\\nSince I think this is a console port, playing with a controller is so much better than on a keyboard. I am used to FPS though, maybe it's just because I'm out of my element. \\n\\nLastly some of the enemy types:\\nThe poison throwers, you can shoot the poisonous explosive out of the air, and even though you shot it right next to the enemy that threw it, and it exploded in their face, it doesn't do any damage.\\nThe shield + dagger enemies. They throw a dagger, and immediately can block after their attack. You would dodge behind them after their attack and immediately recover and counter your backstab. \\n\\n(This wasn't a problem with the game, but seeing how cheerful the reviews were, it kind of put me into a false sense of enjoyment, and it was a big part in buying a game, I play deplorable, unfinished games that have awful reviews, and I've honestly had more fun in those broken games, than struggling with this pitiful combat system.)\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nIt's got great atmospheric music, and it's really relaxing, but the sound design is nothing special,\\nThe background art is very pleasing to the eye, the environment hits a sweet spot.\",\n",

Arrows chargeable for more damage. Lots of upgrades and items for various movement, attacks, protection, and healing. Fight your way through the enemies of each area in search of the boss.\\n\\nVisuals:\\n2D pixelated art style. Gorgeous scenery. Every area has its own aesthetic and there's no mistaking when you enter a new area. \\n\\nAudio:\\nFirst time I ever bought the game's OST so I hope that shows you how good the music is. The sound effects are pleasing to hear (I have the Item Get sound as my phone's text notification sound, it's so perfect.) The main character's scream whenever you die is so ear splitting it makes you want to try even harder to keep her alive.\\n\\nBonus:\\nYou can play as a freakin' cute cat.

       "   'review': 'When this game decides that you die, you die.  Boss fights are more luck and randomness than anything else.  The game goes for the punishing Dark Souls feel, but I never felt like my fate was in my hands, and I never felt like when I died to a boss that \"oh that was me\".  I got to an early boss and wasted about 90 minutes on her. Tried range attacks, tried following her patterns & countering attacking, then ultimately gave up and spammed her.  Strangely, spamming her caused her to do almost no damage, until the game decided nope, she OHK you with the same attack.\\n\\nI felt the whole time while playing this game that there was some element I was missing, some element that made the game about skillful combat but I couldn\\'t figure it out.  I\\'ve beaten all 3 Dark Souls more times than I can count, beaten Salt and Sanctuary more times that I can count, and I\\'ve gotten platinum in Siekro--but this game\\'s combat just felt too random for me to endure it.\\n\\nUpdate: \\nOver a long weekend stuck in a hotel with nothing to do, I booted this game back up and beat it.  It was still more of a chore than anything else. One-hit kill boss battles are just not fun, and the lack of metroidvania upgrades or abilities really make this game feel a 8-bit game from another era that is something else entirely.',\n",

       "   'review': \"A short, sweet metroidvania by a two-person studio, it has a lovely soundtrack and excellent background worldbuilding ala Hollow Knight, but much less forgiving platforming given that Momodora's spike pits are instadeath, even if they are easy to avoid.\\n\\nOverall, the controls feel both floaty and weighty, which should be a bad mix but somehow works really well for the game. Your melee hits do significant hitstun, even against bosses, but your combo has significant cooldown after it completes or you drop/cancel it, so I wasn't able to lock anyone into an inescapable pattern.\\n\\nThe whole game is beautiful in a SNES sort of way, but I wish it was a bit more modern with its minimap. You can tell which rooms you've explored and which ones you haven't (which is a step up on Skautfold), but you can't tell which rooms have secrets/npcs---even if you can tell which rooms have hidden exits, due to them showing up on the map.\\n\\nUltimately, if you like the aesthetic or if you're looking for a warmup before trying something much harder like Hollow Knight, this is an excellent playthrough and fully worth the price.\\n\\nIf you don't like the aesthetic, or if you need exp/stats/grindable progression, something like Skautfold or Bloodstained might suit you better instead.\",\n",

It can be very unfair and I had to die over and over until I learned where the next special thing would pop up to kill me by surprise, so I could try to avoid it. The very first level is already like this, the second escalates immensely. I like challenging game with a high skill ceiling, but this was just frustrating and annoying. Maybe the game would be bearable on easy mode but I can't change the difficulty without starting over.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'A decent refreshing platformer. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight  is a satisfying game that hits all its marks as an indie game. Quality pixel art animations and tight attacks and gameplay will see most players to the end. The story is fairly dry and bread crumbed but with a mostly female cast of enemies and npc’s there is still some uniqueness to this otherwise pretty standard game for its genre. It is fairly short and streamlined as the content feels slightly lacking. The playtime is fairly short and most players will get it done within a couple sessions, (3 if you are a completionist). Despite all this I will still recommend this game because I still had fun with it and would love to see what further works can come from Bombservice',\n",

       "   'review': \"While I have not played the previous games in the series, Momodora came as a suprise to me for being very well done in style, game play, and music. It hits all the check-boxes that makes a good metroidvania title that can easily be completed in a couple days.\\n\\nThe game focuses as you, a priestist of Lun, tasked with traveling to a nearby kingdom to help rid your people of a terrible curse. As you arrive, you find out that the nearby kingdom is scourged with the same curse and riddled with monsters and a depressing setting which contrasts well with the cute nature you think the game will be. There are few NPCs in the entire game, but the little dialog they do provide helps support the bleak setting you are thrust into.\\n\\nGameplay wise, the game is an action platform where you can use a (HOLY) maple leaf to smack your foes about, and a charge-up bow to hit them from afar. Some enemies get stunned and are easy to kill while others require you to dodge and attack which keeps you on your toes at all times. There are also a few powerups (air dodge, spells, potions, rings, etc) but none that really shook up game play for me to a great degree. I would have liked to see more meaningful power-ups but I'm not sure if this is just a staple of the series or not.\\n\\nDifficulty isn't too terrible. I found the game to be challenging mostly with bosses which require you to read their attacks via trial and error but none that posed too much of a threat with the right equipment set-up.\",\n",

I have absolutely no idea what anyone sees in this garbage. The combat isn't enjoyable in any way, enemy design is boring and at times borderline ridiculous (two boss fights are giant women whom you need to smack their tits to kill them), the metroidvania exploratory aspects of the game are near non-existent, the game is very challenging in a boring play-it-super-safe kind of way, there are no interesting weapons or attacks. I generally don't give a shit about story but this game has absolutely none at all(yet the box art/steam art makes it look like some grand adventure with many wacky and interesting characters). \\n\\nI just, I don't get it. There are plenty of other metroid style games out there that are so much better than this.\\n\\nEdit: Oh yeah, the name is stupid, too. How pretentious do you need to be to name your 2-6 hour game MOMODORA: REVERIE UNDER THE MOON LIGHT, like it's some grand adventure or something. I feel like the number of words in a game title shouldn't exceed the hours it takes to complete it on a normal playthrough.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'The best designed Metroidvania I\\'ve ever played. Seriously. This game may be short, but it makes up for it by being so incredibly good. Hollow Knight may have way more content, but even then, I would put these two games equal to each other in terms of quality.\\n\\nAlso, one of the very very few cases where you can unironically say \"its the dark souls of <genre>\". The inspirations are clear, and work well. It feels great to play, difficulty is hard but completely fair.\\n\\nThe only negative thing I have to say about this game is the boob which is very cheesy and probably drives away a lot of people from playing the game. Which is a shame because more people should play this.',\n",

       "   'review': \"TL;DR: Not hard, just tedious. Gorgeous art tho\\n\\nLong version: Almost all of the difficulty in the game comes from one of the following sources\\n- Enemies/bullets that appear from nowhere, forcing you to memorize their locations\\n- Instadeath spikes in locations that aren't especially challenging, but which will cause you to replay the last 5-10 minutes if you touch them\\n- Save points and shortcuts that are extremely scarce, and one-way paths that are fairly abundant, forcing you to navigate through large portions of each area over and over again just to get around\\n- Having to backtrack through old areas (not looking for secrets, just to get around), then getting hit while you're zoned out\\n- Solutions to these problem (eg fast movement, fast travel with bells) being only available in the last third to quarter of the game, once you stop needing them, and not being very effective at their job even then\\n\\nNothing in the game ever really felt challenging; even the final boss and secret boss were pretty easy. Those fights are at least kind of interesting conceptually, but the vast majority of the game is not in those fights, and as outlined above, there isn't much else to it. For most of the time I was playing, I was either bored or mildly frustrated; it felt like the game was trying its hardest to make me zone out, but the game punishes you for doing so with level design that forces you to slowly backtrack through old areas and memorize exact enemy locations. \\n\\nAt this point there are just lots of better action platformers, even by the same publisher (check out Touhou Luna Nights, which has none of these problems). Play something with better level design, more engaging movement and combat mechanics, boss fights that are actually challenging, etc.\",\n",

If you have never played any of the Momodora series, I recommend this one to be your first. some deaths can be unfair, but you lose very little progress if you save at every chance you get. One real problem is the fact that it is extremely easy to get lost even with the map, so I found myself regularly losing my sense of direction and the locations of shops. even with that the jump in visuals from the previous game to this one makes up for it, making me not care about going the wrong way. this is definitely a purchase you won't regret.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I've enjoyed my time with Momodora: RUTM and loved playing through this interesting and wonderfully macabre world. If you don't like Metroidvania's, it could be a nice introductory point for the genre due to it's relatively small over world and most abilities are fairly simple. There are dozens of collectables nearly everywhere, from beating bosses without taking damage, to giving unexpected things to unexpected people, I have barely found half of the stuff possible. The skills and abilities found throughout the different parts of the kingdom really add to the game play especially in boss fights, which I think are a highlight of the game. The pixelated art style adds more atmosphere to the game, by letting your imagination fill in the gaps that the blocky squares don't, and the more detailed sprites, like on the aforementioned bosses, really add a sense of depth to the pixels, as well as stellar designed backgrounds. Over all I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice, brief, atmospheric world to drop themselves in for a little while, as long as they can keep a sharp eye out for secrets.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Another souls-like Metroidvania!! The art style is nice and the sound design builds a good atmosphere. Game-play is solid and feeling kinda similar to the souls \"don\\'t rush it\" formula. Patience is required otherwise you\\'ll get annoyed with the mechanics. Contact damage from enemies is questionable!! Not sure it\\'s needed and can add a cheapness to the combat! Boss fights and many other moments in the game require death to learn what\\'s going on. Again, this feels very cheap as do the boss fights which seem to happen way more often than they need to. All i ever shout is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!! Honestly, it\\'s just not cool...\\n\\nFighting a boss that starts flashing to warn for an attack is fine but when the attack is a massive explosion around the enemy that your witnessing for the first time you just get one hitted, despite having all health upgrades. Dark Souls animates their bosses and adds sound ques so you KNOW something big is about to happen. This is lost in pixel art 2D...and so you die!\\n\\nBut overall, exploration and combat with upgrades sprinkled around make it very much a game that can be hard to put down. It annoys me as much as entertains me. Worth grabbing in a sale but be prepared, this isn\\'t anywhere as balanced and enjoyable as a real souls game. There is jank...and it feels like the dev was probably bullied as a child. It can be a rough time... 6/10 (It\\'s a short game to...only expect between 4-7 hours of gameplay!)',\n",

       "   'review': \"Momodora is a wonderfully made, pick-up-and-play Metroidvania that scratches the action platformer itch, provides tons of cute sprites, tough enemies and obstacles, stark art direction, and great music.\\n\\nI was able to almost 100% the first run in about 8 hours. There's a New Game+ and optional rewards you get for beating bosses without getting hit, so there's plenty of challenge to the game, without overloading you with content like a lot of modern games do.\\n\\nThis game could easily have worked on the DS, or maybe even GBA with some retooling, and I love that. It's rare to find lovingly-crafted pixels and expressive 2-D animation.\\n\\nIf I had to nitpick it, I want to see more spheres and forms! If the Momodora team ever builds a map on the size of the DS Castlevania games and does more with forms (or perhaps other characters... hint hint!), I'll get it in a heartbeat! As it stands, I will probably only need to play through this one or two more times to experience everything. But it's been a breath of fresh air, and I recommend it to any self-respecting Metroidvania player.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This game looks beautiful, has great music, and I think there is a nucleus of a great game wanting to emerge from it.\\n\\nHowever, I ground and ground at it for hours and simply don't 'get' how to play this.  I think it is asking me to diligently learn every enemy's moves and pay a lot of attention to the bosses, but the extremely inconsistent hit detection and absolutely punishing amount of damage mean I die endlessly while trying to proceed.  And dying means a painful shrieking scream out of my speakers, which is hugely jarring.\\n\\nMany times I have reached a point where I thought I was doing well, only to succumb to a poor design choice of an instant kill hit before reaching a save point.  Hilariously, there was one boss I completed, walked to the left, puzzled over whether I was looking at a ledge or water or something and figured the game wanted me to explore - so I jumped in the water and instantly died.  Had to play the boss fight over.  Then, a short time later, I discover my character can exist forever under the water for no apparent reason, but only intended water pools.  THIS is the entire game for me.\\n\\nWill things kill me instantly or reward me for walking up and talking to them?  Is one arbitrary path leading to an impossible boss I'm not ready for or something else?  Will I be hurt by touching an enemy or not?  Who can say.  And, after enough of this, I'm not sure I care anymore.\\n\\nI am punished for doing anything the game designer didn't intend and simply don't have the patience after dying repeatedly to want to wait and learn the boss fights.  I can tell there is a great game here wanting to get out, but it is as if there is a deep almost cultural lexicon which I am missing.\\n\\nIn many ways I *want* there to be a level of uncertainty, but I guess other gamers seem to enjoy a puzzling grind fest.  I get that.  The old Megaman series was a lot like this, but I think I was hoping for something a little more modern Castlevania or Cave Story than old-school difficult.  It probably comes down to whether you want a relaxing game for the weekend after a hard week at work or really need a challenge.\\n\\nThankfully, this was just a random Humble Bundle game for me, so I'm not really disappointed in that.  Just admittedly frustrated at the game to the point where I realize I didn't enjoy much of the past few hours in it.  It is a shame, as the game looks so nice, otherwise, I want to enjoy it.\\n\\nIf you *want* that challenge, this is a good short little game to pass a day with.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Apparently a pretty good metroidvania. But hides some serious problems.\\n\\nGraphics are superb, music and sound are regular.\\n\\nBut the gameplay...\\n\\nThe game allows you to travel practically anywhere non-linearly. Which boss should you face first? Which items does the game expect you to have?\\n\\nBut the death blow is the difficulty. On normal difficulty you need to hit some enemies three times per basis and there are various enemies at the end of the game that require you to hit them SIX times. STANDARD ENEMIES. With two or three on every screen.\\n\\nThis is so annoying and boring!\\n\\nAlso, boss fights kill the game. There is almost no patterns. Bosses change randomly from one kind of attack to the other with no indication at all of what they will do. This does not allow the player to adapt and many of my boss fights consists on spamming attacks on the boss. There is even two bosses which can be killed spamming arrows.\\n\\nItem animations are too long. Having to heal is troublesome enough. But needing almost a whole second is even more troublesome. It is not cool getting hit in the middle of a healing.\\n\\nDodge skill is dumb. You can dodge, but many enemies attack you twice. So you dodge and... get hit by the second blow. Er... why implement dodge at all, then? Have dodge and let player dodge or simply remove it.\\n\\nA beautiful game with no real testing.',\n",

       "   'review': \"It's a metroidvaniaish, it's fairly bug free, and it's got some interesting level design and bosses. Those are some of the good things, but there's a lot of bad as well IMO and in the end it wasn't enough to save me from eventually just loosing interest.\\n\\nIt's made what is, in my opinion, a critical mistake in the design of pretty much any game that includes a dodge: it's easy to get locked out of having access to your dodge. There are common used animation all of the place that lock the dodge for a moment, and result in attempting to dodge... doing nothing. It's perfectly acceptable for big charge-ups or other powerful moves to lock you out of your dodge, it's easy to learn which abilities those are and be prepared to commit to them if you're going to use them. But attacking twice? You're locked out of the dodge for a period of the second attack?\\n\\nIt lacks a key component of metroidvania games for as far as I got, there aren't abilities that open up the map. Just keys. Now... I've seen a number of map areas that appear to need abilities to access them... so I'm guessing that there are abilities somewhere to access them... but at 46% map completion I'd gotten none. At best, there feels like there's a pacing problem somewhere in there.\\n\\nThe story telling felt... just... meh... I simply wasn't pulled in. Then again, I don't play these games for the story telling. I play them for the game play. It was lacking. The game didn't feel fluid, it didn't feel like you had control, it felt like there was an extreme lack control. I realize I set a high standard for this particular genre, as it's one of my favorites... but I just didn't come away from this enjoying my time.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"The primary thing you do in this game is fighting, and the combat system is repetitive, boring, and low-skill. You have two attacks, a melee leaf strike, and a shot with a bow.\\nYou deal with every enemy in exactly the same way:\\n1) You run to melee range, and since every attack stuns them, you just stunlock them to death.\\n2) You stay at a distance and spam arrows until they die.\\n\\nThere's no reason to deviate from this, no reason to vary it up. However, this would be fine, if the enemy design was interesting, alas, this can also be summed up in four different categories:\\n1) Enemies that walk towards you and melee attack you.\\n2) Enemies that throw projectiles or spells in either an arc towards you, or actually targeted.\\n3) Melee enemies that block attacks from the front except when they're attacking.\\n4) Enemies that slowly float towards you and do contact damage/explode.\\n\\nYour only reason for fighting is to earn currency, which is in itself fairly useless.\\nThe next part of combat could be a very redeeming aspect, which is boss fights. Sadly, this is the worst part of Momodora for me. The bosses are just boring slog. They're slow, the attacks are all easily avoided, the telegraphing is extremely inconsistent. To give an example from the same boss, which has 2 melee attacks, one which does roughly 40% of your hp in damage, and one which does 80% of your hp in damage. The former has a long windup + visual effect playing, the latter has one unique frame of animation, quick windup, and no visual effect.\\nIn general, the bosses are slow, have almost no attacks, often very boring ones, can go off-screen/be invulnerable for such long periods of time, that your character literally stands still for long enough to play the idle-fidget animations, one of which is a yawn, which is exactly what the boss fights feel like.\\nAny semblance of difficulty comes completely from the high amount of damage each attack deals, rather than from interesting attacks to dodge. Overall, an extreme disappointment.\\n\\nThis is an easy game, but death is inevitable. Most of the deaths I've had came from one of two sources:\\n1) Water, which in some places you can, and even must swim in to progress. In other places, the exact same looking water is an instant death.\\n2) Spikes, any platforming mistake is an instant death.\\nDeath sets you back to your last save point, which can be quite a far way back, so it becomes rather tedious.\\n\\nLuckily there are a few things in the game that make me not completely regret spending the time on playing it. Firstly, aesthetically the world is pleasing, and the same goes for the music. The story, while nothing special, is cute enough. The characters you meet give the world some flair, and while I was quite disappointed that they almost never react to any actions you've taken in the world, it was still rather pleasant. Secondly, there is some decent exploration, and while secrets mostly lack any indication (except for a passive item that chimes when you enter a room with a secret), it's still something I enjoyed, and the main reason I finished the game.\\n\\nOverall, the game is mediocre at best, and I really don't see how it received such universal acclaim.\",\n",

On my first playthrough, I was able to get the \"True Ending\" without looking at a guide, which is always a good sign. The game was difficult for me in the beginning, however once I had gotten a handle on the controls/appropriately dodging, the game does become quite enjoyable.\\n\\nOverall, I did like the game eventually, with a few caveats:\\n\\nCons:\\n- The early game will punish you for recklessly moving forward; I\\'m not certain if this was intentional, but often times your HP only allows for 3 hits before dying. While this does force you to get a better handle of the controls, I have to admit I rage quit a couple times (though I did keep coming back)\\n- With some boss fights, there is not always a save point prior to the boss room; this can make some boss fights frustrating\\n- The map is a bit annoying - it would have been helpful if the different areas were color coded\\n\\nPros:\\n- The game offered a decent challenge once the game mechanics were learned\\n- Interesting areas to explore\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- While there are new sprites for enemies in new areas, there are a number of enemy types which are pretty much the same. Once you\\'ve gotten a handle on these basic enemy types, the game becomes a lot easier.\\n\\nMy first playthrough took me just under 8 hours to complete with most of the secrets found.',\n",

       "   'review': 'Horrible game design. I respawned a million times at the first save point (within the tutorial part) and had to play the last half of the tutorial over and over again just because I died again and again as soon as enemys came who actually did something. When you design your next game, try to think of beginners who need to figure out how to fight so just put a damn respawn point right in front of the first real enemys.\\nSpeaking of figuring out the controls: I took so long to figure them out because I played with the keyboard, which had been an excruciating experience. You cant change the controls and to me jumping on a, attacking on s, sniping with d and dodging with q is the weirdest thing ever. Just make the controls editable.\\nAlso the tutorial shows basically nothing. You get introduced to some blocking guy who only blocks from one side. So you just dodge onto the other side and slam him from behind, simple and easy. But when you get to the actual enemys who, as I mentioned, \"do something\" they all of a sudden change direction when you try to do that and block the other side. And then they randomly throw out knifes at you too. Thanks for introducing me to an uterly useless version of this before.  So I just have to kill 10 useless things over and over to find out that they actually do way more and are way harder to kill.\\nI dont care dieing, if I wouldnt had to do utterly useless things over and over. It made me rage quit in the end.',\n",

       "   'review': \"This game has really set me in a somber mood, one that I most typically and excruciatingly dislike. But, in this case, it was a good thing, no, a GREAT experience. The tone of the game lets you know that not everything is going to be hugs and kisses, even though the cute, pixelated, chibi-like appearances of almost all of the characters says otherwise (Koha is so cute). \\n \\nThe music was phenomenal. All soundtracks had a melancholic tone to them, some less than others. One particular soundtrack, triggered when entering the stage known as the [spoiler]Subterranean Grave[/spoiler], completely creeps me out, and I love it! \\n \\nI'm a fan of the pixelated art-style; it will always have a special place in my heart. I would definitely play through it again if there were some incentive for me, [spoiler] but I'm NOT a fan of having to replay through a game to get different endings[/spoiler]. \\n \\nFor a $10 game, $12 for the soundtrack bundle (I got the soundtrack bundle on sale for $5.19), the content is justified. I finished the game within 3 days, but I did enjoy the little bit that I played, and there was still quite a bit I had left to discover. \\n \\nI'm not much of an expert to speak of anything else with expertise, so... \\n \\nTL;DR Version: \\nGood game. Would recommend.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Misterious, challenging and beautiful, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is an open-ended 2D action scroller with an absolutely amazing visual department with fluid and detailed animations on a pixelated, but beautiful art style. Its single map contains a maze to explore with different environments that hide different visuals and enemies, hiding upgrades, items, easter eggs and even new environments that will encourage the player to explore. Its designed to be replayed, with a New Game+ mode, and additional difficulties that will prove to be quite the challenge.\\n\\n[h1]Its affordable price tag makes it a no-brainer for fans of metroidvania 2D side-scrollers, and it's also recommended to anyone looking for a challenging game.[/h1]\\n\\nNow onto the details:\\n\\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\\nYou're thrown into the shoes of Kaho, a priestess of the Lun village, which has fallen victim of a curse that has extended itself throughout the land, and it's your duty to find a remedy.\\n\\nThroughout the story you'll discover more about the world around you, and will meet unique characters, be it allies or foes.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\\nTo be honest, one of the things that made me try out this game was seeing it on Youtube and being stunned by the animation quality and art. It's brimming with personality. Unique and expressive characters and beautiful backgrounds make for a stimulating experience, with each area containing different environments and enemy types, each with their own theme.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nGameplay reminded me of [i]Dust: An Elysian Tail[/i], and breaks down in three main categories:\\n[list]\\n[*] [b]Exploration[/b]\\nThe game is set on an open-ended environment, which means that you'll be trapped in a single level where you can go back and forth to any direction you want, and revisit places at any time.\\n\\nThis kind of gameplay has it's pros, and cons:\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Allows the player to pace the gameplay and explore the level to their heart's content without having to worry whether they'll miss something out.\\n[*] The environment is refined and there are many multi-purposed areas. This means that some passageways are initially unreachable by the player, which with the later found upgrades, can be explored, bringing life again to what seemed [i]just another cleared area[/i]. With the addition of fast-travel on the latter half of the game just makes exploration more entertaining.\\n[/list]\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Requires backtracking. One of the bad things about these kind of games is that, until you start getting oriented, and/or receive fast-travel, you might find yourself mindlessly walking around the same areas over and over again, which can get a bit repetitive, more so in the first half of the game.\\n[/list]\\n[*] [b]Combat[/b]\\nCombat is composed of two components: Melee, and ranged attacks.\\n\\nMelee has a simple 4 combo mechanic that can be repeatedly used with no cooldown, it's simple yet satisfactory to use, and very effective.\\n\\nRanged attacks are done with a bow and an [i]infinite[/i] amount of arrows, so you don't need to worry about ammo since you'll be using it, [b]a lot[/b]. The bow is the most complex of the two, allowing for charged attacks that, with upgrades, can charge to different levels, attacking in different ways. Other upgrades include rate-of-fire, charge speed and damage.\\n\\nHowever, our protagonist can also [b]dodge[/b] by rolling. It's a really effective and useful mechanic, nullifying any damage done to Kaho when on a roll.\\n\\nThe only frustrating aspect is [b]contact damage[/b] which makes some boss fights frustrating as you'll find yourself taking damage before learning that some characters will roll and move like the player, only that they deal damage by merely [b]touching[/b]. Obviously this is based on preference, as the game will give you the tools to overcome this, and you'll have to approach combat in a different way.\\n\\n[*] [b]Items[/b]\\nThere's a simple inventory system, with slots for consumable items, and passive items. They are sold by different merchants with the in-game currency obtained by either secrets or killing enemies.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]Well, off to check out the rest of the series.[/h1]\",\n",

       "   'review': \"A short and sweet metroidvania with gorgeous pixel art, fun and challenging bosses, and the perfect amount of depth for its length. It completely okay to play without having played previous Momodora games. The only downside is that a fair amount of content (in the form of items) is locked behind beating each boss without taking a hit. The game is replayable with a New Game+ that includes new enemy placements and a harder difficulty level for the masochistic among us, but I didn't play either. I would've liked another way to acquire those items, or at least less powerful versions of each. \\n\\nWould recommend to fans of metroidvanias, or those who are looking to try out the genre.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'This is a very solid Metroid-vania. While the game is short (I finished it in 4 hours), there was never a dull moment. I was constantly going to a new level within 20-30 minutes, which also meant that I was facing a boss within 20-30 minutes. All the levels and bosses are unique and different from each other, which made for a fairly fun experience.\\n\\nIn this game, you play as a priestess who attacks with a maple leaf…… just roll with it. She also has a normal weapon, a bow, which she uses for ranged attacks. So you have a melee attack and a ranged attack. The ranged attack has the benefit of range (duh) but the drawback is that it does less damage. While the melee attack has the drawback of needing you to get close to your enemies, and therefore putting you at risk of taking damage, the benefit is that it does more damage AND it\\'s guaranteed to stun most enemies on hit (apart from bosses). Because both attacks have very real benefits and drawbacks, you\\'re going to want to switch between them as the situation changes, which keeps combat interesting.\\n\\nEnemies themselves are pretty fun to fight. Full disclosure, if you were to face any enemy 1 on 1, you would probably destroy them. However, what keeps enemies interesting is the COMBINATION of different enemies at once. The levels are designed in such a way that you can\\'t just run through spamming the attack button. You have to wait a little bit, think about the best way to approach the enemies and how they\\'ll react to seeing you, and approach them with a mini-strategy in mind. That doesn\\'t mean the game is slow. It\\'s actually pretty fast-paced, and in fact the correct strategy is often to be on the offensive and attack the enemy before they have time to attack you. It\\'s just that 1 wrong move can lead you to taking a hit (for example, if an enemy takes 3 hits to die but you press the attack button 4 times, the level is designed in a way to punish you for it). So yea, the level design is top-notch.\\n\\nIn regards to bosses, they all look and act very differently from each other (e.g. you\\'re not just fighting a lot of big dudes in armor like in Dark Souls 2). They also require some level of mastering before you\\'ll be able to overcome them. This is because each boss has very specific timing on when you\\'re supposed to dodge the attack. You can\\'t just spam dodge as soon as you see the attack and expect to not take damage. You have to learn the proper timing through trial and error. Furthermore, each boss will drop an item if you can kill them without taking damage. This adds a whole new level of challenge to bosses, and it\\'s something I found a lot of enjoyment in.\\n\\nThe progression in the game is the game\\'s weakest point. You don\\'t get any new weapons, so you always have only 2 very specific attacks. You also don\\'t get any new movement abilities (you get a mid-air dodge, but that\\'s for combat and is never used for platforming. You also are eventually able to turn into a cat, but that\\'s just to fit into small spaces). There\\'s no levelling. In regards to loot, you only have 3 active item slots and 2 passive item slots. 1 active item slot is used for healing (i.e. estus flask), so you really only have 2 active item slots and 2 passive item slots. The passive items you can get are pretty boring and are just damage increases, money drop increases, etc… (you\\'re basically going to use 2 loadouts. 1 loadout increases money collection and reveals secrets. Another loadout increases damage). While there are a lot of active items that are spells, they\\'re effectively useless because all spells require a charge time. That\\'s too slow for bosses and it\\'s faster to kill normal enemies with melee. So yea….. You\\'re not going to progress much from the time you start playing. What you\\'re doing in the beginning of the game is preeeeeeeeeeetty much what you\\'re going to be doing at the end of the game.\\n\\nApart from the progression, there are 2 other weaknesses that stop this game from being anything better than \"good\".\\n\\t• Damage buffs too strong: With the active and passive items, you can get a lot of damage increases that make fighting bosses too easy (active item that gives 100% more damage + passive item that gives 100% more damage at low health + passive item that gives fire damage to attacks = 200%+ damage). This meant that most bosses took like 30 seconds - 1 minute to beat.\\n\\t• Not too difficult/mechanically complex: Enemies eventually become a non-issue because they all die in like 3-5 hits and by the end you have plenty of healing to tank hits until you reach the next save point. Even bosses aren\\'t all that difficult since most of them only have like 3-4 attacks, and almost every attack is simply a matter of timing your dodge-roll properly. Not even jumping is required to dodge any boss attack. It would\\'ve been more interesting if your character had more defensive options to choose from (e.g. blocking) or if more enemy attacks required you to move in certain ways to dodge them. \\n\\nThere\\'s a vague story thrown in. A queen in a kingdom is spreading a curse across the land, and you were sent to stop her. Along the way, you see a lot of NPC\\'s who\\'ve lost hope. It\\'s a fairly typical \"slay the villain\" kind of story. None of the characters are developed or anything (most characters only say 3 things in the entire game) and there\\'s no explanation of WHY anything is happening, so there\\'s nothing really to get attached to.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good Metroid-vania game. However, at the end of the day I can\\'t say it\\'s any better than \"good\" because it\\'s over too quickly and it\\'s honestly not all that hard. Still, I had a fun time playing this game while it lasted.',\n",

Most bosses took one try to learn what they did, and then another try to actually defeat them. The art style is very well done, and the music is wonderful and fitting.  Many areas in the game give off a dark/creepy vibe, without over-using things like blood or corpses like some other games might. \\n\\nI'm not very familiar with castlevania/metroidvania type games, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this and would recommend it to any of my friends.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"God I love this cute lil' boop.\\n\\n[i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] is apparently the fourth game in the [i]Momodora[/i] series, but since it's also apparently a prequel, I'm not going to fret about having never played nor heard of any of the others. At a glance, the story's nothing special - you play a priestess from a small village which has become affected by a spreading wickedbadness, and apparently its source is the massive capital city a couple blocks over. Being the fine upstanding do-gooder you are, you grab your ritual whackin' leaf and head off to see the queen and find out what's wrong with her plumbing. Upon arrival, you find that everything is deeply horrible, and must slay a bunch of bosses in various corners of the kingdom to unlock the path to the final boss and kick it in the jibblies. All very fine and nice and straightforward.\\n\\nFortunately for us, the team behind [i]M:RUtM[/i] decided to go with the Soulsborne writing style of Showing a world rather than Telling one. As you explore, you meet survivors of the queen's curse who ramble and prattle on and share some deep life goals, but they do a marvelous job of keeping exposition to a minimum. Instead, you have gorgeously polished 2D environments that explain the state of decay far more clearly than words ever could, and each item you pick up offers a couple sentences of vague plot-snacks that make the world at large just a teensy bit clearer. Couple all that with delightful enemy and boss design that straddles chibi and horror splendidly and you've won me over before we even get to the gameplay.\\n\\n...And then the gameplay's great! Goodness gracious, you little weasels went and accomplished a whole lot with very little there, didn't you? Your character starts the game with a melee attack combo and a few arrow tricks, and you essentially go the whole game relying on those and some consumables. Rather than throwing a massive arsenal at you which you'll never quite get the hang of, [i]Mr. UM[/i] makes each boss encounter creative and complex enough that you need to work out how to go about dodging everything they throw at you while still inflicting damage of your own. And because Bombservice knows it's my favorite gimmick in the world and loves me very much, they even threw in a mechanic where beating a boss flawlessly rewards you with special, unique pieces of equipment, complete with tasty, tasty plot snippets.\\n\\nIt's not a terribly long game, but that's perfectly fine. What we have here is polished 'til it shines, and even if some pieces of the game seem baffling, I'm willing to accept that that's just the devs having fun. If you enjoy a good Metroidvania, [i]Momodora[/i]'s one of the best on the market, offering an immediately lovable world and solid gameplay for filthy casuals and elite pro-gamers alike.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"So, Momodora is a pre-quel entry and the 4th installment in the series. This was the very first Momodora experience for me. \\n\\n Despite all of it's flaws, it was quite a good experience. If you ask to me, Momodora is a great option for people to enter the metroidvania(-like) games. It is somewhat short, well adjusted in difficulty, filled with secrets, subtle designed and connected world, also flavored with soulslike experience. It may be hard to catch up with the story & lore. However, people are used to play these kind of games for it's gameplay. So I'll be examining Momodora in gameplay wise. \\n\\n You have some basic controls. Jump, roll (and dash in the air later on), attack. You can attack with either your sword or bow. I think bow is quite overpowered if you would have taken pickups later around the midgame. Still, I think bosses are challenging enough. After all, you will memorize the bosses' patterns and the whole map because you will be backtracking a lot. \\n\\n What I most dislike about the game is sadly it's final ending and the boss itself. The final boss was quite easy on normal. Bosses are sweet with their animations and all but as in gameplay wise, I just could not say they are great. Specifically final boss is just too basic. Also the game just punishes you if you have not collected a single particular item. That being said the game only has 2 endings which are Bad Ending and True Ending. I mean there are usually Good&Bad&optional/secret endings. There are no proper ending. If you have collected the item you can get the true ending & achievement. If you have not collected that item you just fail and can't fight with the phase 3 of the final boss. If it wasn't a guide, I would not have been finished the game with true ending. \\n\\n + Pretty good amounts of bosses with variety\\n + Cleverly designed levels \\n + A good place to start playing metroidvania(-like) games\\n + It is short but lives it's price tag\\n + Charming animations & pixel art \\n + Item variety, map filled with secrets \\n + Pretty well designed difficulty except few situations + great checkpoint system that is similar to the bonfires\\n\\n - The final boss is just like another boss with 3 phases. \\n - Bosses are usually subpar in gameplay terms comparing them to games like Rogue Legacy, Dead Cells, Castlevania et cetera.\\n - Endings are bad in narrative terms and doesn't give the feeling of accomplishment \\n - Platforming is kinda irritating at times \\n\\nI give the game a solid 78 out of 100 though. It was enjoyable. Looking forward for a sequal filled with better secrets and bosses, and hopefully more lengthful.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35602119-The-Deus-eX-foX/ My curator page.\",\n",

The art is really charming, the movement and combat feels responsive and crisp, and the gameplay is fun while still presenting enough of a challenge to cater to both hardcore sadists and newcomers alike. I would definitely recommend this game to veterans of the genre and to those who are interested in getting a first taste.',\n",

       "   'review': 'Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a graphically stunning game, with great atmosphere and an eye-catching story. \\n\\nThe only problem I have with it, is that fighting enemies is needlessly unfair. There would be times where 4+ enemies were in the same room and it would be impossible to dodge their attacks because of how small the area was. \"Why not just kill them?\" you might of asked. Well, everytime you attack an enemy, the character steps a bit forward, leaving other enemies to attack you repeatedly. They don\\'t even have to attack you to deal damage, the character just has to bump into them.\\n\\nEven so, dealing damage to your foes feels great, and the combat problem is nowhere to be found in the boss battles.\\n8/10',\n",

Momodora is worth a try since it's not very expensive. \\n\\nGetting it on sale is a nice deal. The game is pretty short and took me around 4 hours to beat it and get the True Ending, the maps are nice to explore but the controls are a bit clunky and may take a while to get used to.\\nIt's not like this game is bad, it is quite good and fun but I have to say that nothing really in this game stands out. There aren't many attack options, very few enemy variety, it's very short and the story is kinda average, soundtrack also didn't catch my attention.\\n\\nGet it when it's on sale and if you like Metroidvania games, it's a nice game to have in your library but don't expect too much from this game.

       "   'review': \"tl;dr If you like dying and jumping on platforms – go for it, it's really worth it\\n\\nWelp, I got much more fun from it than I expected (but it was a forgotten game on my list from some kind of bundle, so I couldn't have much expectations to begin with).\\n\\nThe controls are what you would expect from solid, non-forgiving, yet fair, metroidvania. Every mistake I made was my, and my only. Whacking enemies is pretty fun, though you might quite quickly find that avoiding them is just as effective (except for some cases). Main character feels satisfying to walk, jump, dash and fight, which is important to mention, beacuse if opposite happens in a game, it ruins a whole lotta fun, in my opinion.\\n\\nGraphics are really appealing. I wouldn't necessary say that everything looks stunnig, but it's solid, modern pixelart. Quite nice touch is actually seeing it being only pixelart, and none of that blurs and effects on lighting and shading. Same goes for animation – satisfying to watch (I often found myself just swinging the weapon around to see how the character moves, so kudos to the animators).\\n\\nMusic and sound design is good. There's nothing that stuck with me (even after repeating bosses several times in a row) so I can't say it's too memorable, but it's solind and enjoyable. I'm not sure on this one, but I would say that most of the bosses share the same track, which gets boring after some time (and loses a lot of its drama).\\n\\nBosses, are, of course, the main course and boy, are they really thoughtful put together. With a few expections, every fight is unique and memorable, and even though I can't remember all of the characters names, I still remember how to fight them and what moves thes execute in which order. Those are the main difficulty of the game, and the reason you die so often, as expected, but I rarely felt irritated during the process.\\n\\nDifficulty is rather low dare I say. Despite many options in-game and additional challanges suggested by achievements I didn't have much problem with finishing the game on hard difficulty in around 4 hours, and then re-running it again on insane difficulty (you basically die in one hit form 90% of stuff) in half the time. But then again, for somebody new to the genre it might be more challenging.\\n\\nStory and characters are quite basic, devs really wanted to go for this scarce, dark souls-ish item descrition lore, but I didn't get hooked. You probably could create quite interesting universe while reading all descriptions and dialogues, but the main arc of the game would still be quite mundane. I don't wanna get into details, but *great threat*, *4 powerful beings*, *primodial evil*, you know the drill.\\n\\nAnd last, but not least – heavily inspired by some elements from Dark Souls. I mean, usually it's game mechanics or something like that, but this time I found myself giggling while finding exact replica of “Does not open from this side” frm my beloved franchise. Beside that, the general feel of the city was came preety close to Dark Souls 3, and the panels showing names of the locations were almost identical. Maybe at this point I'm nitpicking, but I there's only so many options for doing these kinda stuff in different ways, so I can't say I'm disappointed or mad.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"bought it on sale, however I wish I paid full price for it. Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a fun metroidvania game with beautiful 2d graphics, the music is a treat to listen to as well, each track making me want to explore the area to completion. The difficulty is pretty fair but still gives a good challenge, with each death feeling like one you got without it feeling cheap. overall I'd give this game a 9.5 / 10 it would get a 10 / 10 if it were a little bit longer.\",\n",

Is it bad? Hell no. Really my only quarrel with it is the lack of world-building, things like why bosses fight you and why they are located where they are. Things like the reasoning and rationale of a character that guides the choices that they make, but hey nothing is perfect. The game is still gorgeous what with it's game design, secrets, and gameplay. Sadly there isn't much for multiple playthroughs other than completing all the endings, and getting all the items and achievements. Still, I'd very highly recommend this game.\",\n",

Can be categorized in the bullet-hell genre considering that each bosses will have their own unique attack patterns, and that you'll be required to study and analyze them in order to get past them; in one piece. Each soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the location you're in, as well as the bosses. Let's take Pardoner Fennel for an example, you can feel the sorrow and despair her theme has, as how the queen she once entrusted has turned into a bewitched being who now just lusts for power. \\nWhat I found best about this game is that you'll be rewarded an item everytime you best a boss without suffering any damage. I mean, of course the player should be rewarded, after all they've spent countless hours studying each boss's attack patterns to perform damageless runs.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Momodora is a beautifully crafted adventure game and one of the best metroidvanias I had the pleasure to experience. \\n\\nThe graphics, although simple, are quite satisfying to look at, specially during the action sequences. \\n\\nThe gameplay is responsive and gives you a variety of tools to play with as you customise your playstyle (I in particular had a blast using a pure damage build that nuked every boss in a few hits from Kaho's magical leaf). It is quite challenging even in normal difficulty, so bewarned.\\n\\nThe story is full of mysteries that will keep you guessing for a good part of the game, although it is a shame that many questions are never truly answered, something that keeps me longing for a sequel.\\n\\nOverall, this is a hidden gem. Worth the price I would say, but this game goes on sale quite often, so you can get it for a bargain.\\nThe only problem I have with the whole experience is that it is a bit too short.\\n\\n9/10\",\n",

       "   'review': 'PROS\\n- Fun gameplay; it\\'s fun to roam around, trying out different paths.\\n- Combat is satisfying.\\n- Soundtrack is good and nice to listen to without being too intrusive.\\n\\nCONS\\n- Difficult, but not in the good way. \\nUsing Hollow Knight for comparison, the truly difficult enemies and bosses in that game have unorthodox attack patterns, attack you from a place that is difficult to reach, or require precise timing in dodging and counterattacking.\\nThe difficulty in the enemies of this game is \"This enemy does ungodly amounts of damage for no reason. Eat a dick.\"\\nSeriously. The beginning enemies can chew off half of your health bar in one hit. A lot of enemies have really bland attack patterns (wait, jump. wait, jump.) and can be (kind of) easily avoided, like those ghost-wolves in the second area. They still do really high amounts of damage for what is supposed to be a run-of-the-mill \"haha im in your way\" enemy, but fine, this game is made to be difficult.\\nBut the goddamn witches snip off half your health bar in one hit. Their attacks also go through walls, are targeted (meaning they aim to where your character was/is), and are ranged. There\\'s some areas in the beginning of the game where you can\\'t see the witch on screen, but you can hear it and see it attacking you.\\n- The backgrounds of the game, while pretty, make it really hard to see translucent enemies spawning out of nowhere. Speaking of:\\n- Enemies spawn out of nowhere. No warning, no sound, no special graphic, nothing. Just a spawning animation. And it doesn\\'t help that a lot of them are transparent, so they\\'re even harder to see against backgrounds depending on their color.\\n\\n\\nI want to like this game. It\\'s charming, the character designs are cute/cool, the combat is satisfying as hell. \\nBut this isn\\'t how you make a game difficult; this is how you make a game unfair.\\nIf you like getting disintegrated by beginning-game level enemies, I can recommend this 100%.\\nIf you\\'d rather not, I can\\'t say this game\\'s for you.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: I never understood the concept of having enemies having hitboxes aside from their attacks. Why does the body of a regular human wearing a white dress hurt me? If it\\'s a knight with spiky armor, sure. But just some regular old Steve Johnson? I don\\'t understand.',\n",

Even on the hardest difficulty the game really isnt hard due to a large amount of checkpoints and the fact the game is fairly short. The bow feels like it almost should have been the main weapon in this game because it is so much more useful than melee, especially if you get a handful of bow specific damage items.\\n\\nThe art in particular is quite nice with a couple of very well done scenes that stand out even from the rest of the game.\\n\\nThe game is unfortunately very short.',\n",

If you are also familiar with Metroidvania games there will be a lot of aspects to appreciate. I think overall, the game is well made, it's a brief and enjoyable experience that knows very well where it's strenghts lies. \\n\\nBut it may be too dependant on the mix of genres to draw the player in, and while it's enough, it does not challengue any new boundries, it just proves that the mix goes well, without adding too much of it's own elements, to a mixture some may have been able to guess would work.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This is one of the best indie games I've ever played. The combat is simple, but still very engaging because of stellar level design. You have to platform your way around enemies and their projectiles to kill them, which makes every single room a unique combat experience. And the exploration is amazing. There are so many little secrets that make exploring every nook and cranny of the map rewarding and beneficial to player progression.  This is one of a very small handful of games I've gotten every achievement/ trophy in because I love it that much. \\n\\nA few negatives. The movement can feel a bit slow, especially after playing a game where the player speed is sanic fast. And the jumping is a bit weak. Siting here though I can't think of anything else wrong with the game. Basically this game is a masterpiece. A must buy for metroidvania fans, indie fans, or anyone who can spare a few dollars.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'TL;DR I\\'m not sure this game was play tested. It\\'s very pretty, but very annoying to play.\\n\\nThis game is almost good. This game has so many things going for it in the looks, sound, and world building departments; but this game is lacking everywhere else. The controls are so stiff, but I did get used to them, and there were so many BS deaths that I just couldn\\'t avoid. The areas were interesting to explore, but I accidentally stumbled into the end of the game because nothing told me that I happened upon the final boss. I accidentally got the bad end (which I didn\\'t know was a thing in this game), but I still had so much left to do. The starting area was pretty intuitive when introducing mechanics, but then there are some parts of the game where it doesn\\'t tell you enough or where it straight up contradicts it\\'s self! For example: the game teaches you that water kills by letting you jump off a bridge, but then there\\'s a whole under water area I couldn\\'t find because I thought the entrance would kill me. I\\'m also pretty sure the game broke on me too. There\\'s an npc that gives you money for bugs, and at some point they just stopped accepting the bugs I was collecting... I would talk to them and they\\'d say \"bring me more bugs and I\\'ll reward you,\" but they wouldn\\'t take the bugs or reward me.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Big disappointment. The crappy controls and menus reminds me of the 90's, not to mention the unmappable keys. Enemies do a ton of damage and you can't even air dodge, trying to explore doesn't yield much and every time you die you have to start from a waypoint from a mile away while every enemy twoshot you. Sometimes attacks would go through enemies but your animation lock will make get you in contact and take dmg which is always about 50% of your total health. It's really stupid and annoying.\\n\\nOverall, The pixel graphics would be okay but from controls to mechanics and gameplay just feels annoying and clunky. I've played dozens of similar type games but this I'll just give up because I don't have fun with it at all.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This is a bad metroidvania. So many positive reviews only for the good graphics is a terrify. Yes, it's beautiful, but there is just a lot of problems with game design. People had different claims about: duration of the game, useless power-up's, annoying enemies, level design, pixel jumps and some bugs on bosses (attacks animations, attacks of enemies from behind the locked screen), but the main problem is in the working with the genre.\\n\\nThis metroidvania punishes you for research. You must learn the exact paths from the proposed scheme: 3-5 rooms, save point, 3-5 rooms, etc. Any distraction from this route is punished with the instant death holes and enemies spam attacks. You passed two and a half locations, discover some secrets, buying and changing equipment, killing enemies for the gold, and then accidentally died, because there is nowhere to fill your health? Be kind to go through all of this again! It's just like to read the same paragraph over and over. This is an incredibly dull affair.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Definitely lighter on story and heavier on gameplay, but I found the plot behind the game to be pretty intriguing, especially with the creepy setting. I'd heard a lot about how difficult it is, but I think the difficulty is pretty reasonable - for the most part it's all approachable. You might have to retry some bosses or areas, and some sections include instakill spots where you have to be really careful about your jumping timing or placement, but it feels [i]challenging[/i], not impossible. It's also challenging enough even in the easier spots to keep your attention. The art is great - nostalgic without looking old or low-quality - and the music is really incredible to listen to. Definitely worth a try.\",\n",

The art is amazing, the soundtrack is beatiful (i getted stucked in Fezzel for a 30 minuts, i guess, and now her song is my favorite, and a special thx to Bombservise for fck my feels, i really didnt expectate for that, and how im pretty slow understanding the things, just talking with Paramol again i understanted, who was THAT new npc in monastery, and after cry for 5 minuts, i taked my achieviment and cotinued my game), but is really short!\\n\\nIf u just rush the game, doesnt care with the achievs too much, the hided things and doesnt dieying as fck, like me, u can end the game in one day, but for the other achievs (how i still have to do xD), i think its pretty replayable(that word exist?)\\n\\njust one thing letted me a little unconfurtable: The control... If u have a controler USB, u can just ignore this and will play, but if are u thinking in play on keyboard... i telling u, that is  probably the worst decision that u can make, i know, i know, didnt have much buttons what are confortables to use for a long time in keyboard, but... A,S,D and i cant remember all then because i changed in the first seconds. that wasnt a good decision, in my sight\\n\\nMomodora can be resumed in a short, but really good game, if u want some fast experience, doesnt want to pay too much, a pretty art and soundtrack. thats for u :)',\n",

       "   'review': \"You must understand that the initial toughness of this game is balanced later on. It's off putting at first (when I played it, it seemed so unforgiving that I left it alone for a while) but once I came back with a fresh attitude I realized the strategy behind it. Never go too far without saving and always play defensively … it is better to take your time with a boss and come out unscathed than button smash your health bar into oblivion. Also take breaks! If you get cocky and fly through tough enemies only to die to a common one, it can get irritating. I think the balance is just right; you must believe in the beginning, look at that beautiful pixelated art and press forward. There’re some charms you get later that turn the game from an ordeal into a wonderful experience, with different enemies, environments, music and bosses. \\nI like the story as well; the country girl who comes into the city to address a curse that reached her homeland seemed like a novel idea. Everyone laughing at her for doing so seemed so as well. I also found her extremely cute. The way she didn’t get a message box and yet still communicated with other characters only added to the charm. This is a dungeon-crawler I massively enjoyed and would recommend to anyone who liked games such as Hollow Knight, Dead Cells or Ori and the Blind Forest; difficult but rewarding.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Pros:\\ngood controls\\nlooks great\\ndecent soundtrack\\ngood atmosphere\\n\\ncons:\\nbad level design\\nbad boss fights\\nbad at teaching the player\\narbitrary multiple endings\\nbad difficulty pacing\\nbad upgrades\\n\\nnow to justify myself: ((MAJOR SPOILERS FOR BOSSFIGHTS AND LEVEL DESIGN))\\nThe level design is good on most accounts except for a lot of places where jumps are 1 or 2 pixels higher than you can jump, tricking players into thinking they can make it up there when they cannot. There are also places where enemies that are designed to blend into the background (paintings, statues) are introduced by placing them on the other side of an instant death pit, causing you to slam your face into them and die. There are also way too many instant-death spikes and tricky jumps that just feel like cheap deaths.\\n\\nThe bosses are good looking, but their fight design is pretty awful. The first boss has several attacks with vague sprites (as in, they are mostly transparent and circular with minimal indication) and I found myself turning down the graphics options to lower the detrimental graphical effects such as lighting that hides indicators and particles that clutter the screen. Along with this, many bosses have attacks that either cover most of the screen (the witch that you fight twice has an attack that is both vague and covers a lot of the screen) or chase you down. In particular, one of the humanoid bosses has an attack in their seconds phase in which they dash towards you, swing their sword twice, and then spin across half the screen. This attack lasts for multiple seconds, can always hit you, and can change directions three times. this is basically the \"I\\'m going to now roll back and forth\" period of her fight. Along with this, the humanoid bosses just love to shove themselves inside of you while you roll, causing you to get hit as soon as your I-frames end. You will roll through an attack only for the boss to move into your space and hit you anyways, it\\'s frustrating. Along with this, some bosses have attacks with minimal or NO indication. The 3rd to last bossfight in the game has an arrow-shooting character who will leap across the screen and cover the center with arrows. the only way to see this coming is to either look at her (which means your not watching the much more important boss that you\\'re actually fighting on the ground)  or to just always assume they\\'re about to do it, which is lame.\\n\\nThe game also has a bad habit of not showing or telling you what enemies do before they hit you. There is an enemy early on that falls on your head when you stand under it, and this is fine, but then they introduce an orange variation later on that can go in any direction and the first time you find out about this is when it chases you through a tight tunnel you are trapped in. You are given minimal time to react to a new enemy that you have not seen before, and you get hit because of it. \\n\\nThere are multiple endings in this game SPOILER ALERT and it is really dumb. To get the good ending, you simply play through the game as normal except you use a box of wind to upgrade your leaf. That\\'s it, that\\'s all you need to do. No choices, no gameplay challenge, just go use the box on the windmill and voila. This is unfulfilling and leads to the extremely easy final boss to being even more anticlimatic when you don\\'t even get the good ending. And aside from this, there are very few direct upgrades to your weapons.\\n\\nThe difficulty curve is really strange and is not really curved at all. I didn\\'t notice the challenge ramping up even a little, with most rooms in the early game being just as hard as the rooms later on. What I did notice was that there were many more cheap enemies that appear out of nowhere or hit you from off-screen in the early game and late game, which makes the mid-game my favorite. The witches are the most egregious example, firing large pink projectiles at you from off-screen that have very vague hitboxes (the attack is made of mostly transparent square sprites and I think a transleucent pink ball) and enemy melee attacks can similarly start off-screen. Compound this with the fact that your basic attack does nothing to deter enemy attacks, and a lot of situations can feel cheap and un-reactable. This is basically gone in the mid-game, but it returns in the late game with enemies like paintings and statues that blend in with background elements until you start recognizing their exact shape, as well as some enemies that literally appear from the walls and hit you. The very last stretch of the game is 3 bossfights that feel completely out of order. the first one is the most difficulat, featuring two different characters with hard to read attacks, the second one boils down to a guessing game similar to 1 ball 3 cups, and the last one is a cakewalk that ends the game completely anitclimactically \\n\\nThe upgrades you buy from the single in-game shopkeeper are incredibly lame. Most of them are not very useful (there\\'s one that increases your damage and also hurts you randomly, which is totally useless when you\\'re trying not to die, along with one that applies poison to your arrows, which only helps in boss fights but is really not worth it sine the arrows aren\\'t very strong anyways) and in the end the only upgrades that are worth anything are the mandatory story ones that give you mostly bow and dodge upgrades and one store upgrade that makes your weaker attacks flinch enemies, which makes the game incredibly easy. Other than that there are money collecting upgrades I never used, a ring that tells you where secrets are, thus completely ruining the point, the aforementioned random death device, one that raises your resistance to bad effects which only occur from incredibly weak enemies very early in the game, one that increases the speed of your arrows from pretty much instant to literally instant and probably more I didn\\'t even bother buying. You can have two of these at a time and the choice is pretty obvious, which would be flinching attacks and poison arrows, and the poison arrows are just for bosses anyways.',\n",

       "   'review': \"-Synopsis-: \\n\\n       Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a 2-D metroidvania where you control a cute little priestess \\n       named Kaho. She is sent on a mission to save her village from a dastardly curse threatening her land by \\n       seeking an audience with the queen of Karth. When arriving at Karst it's immediately understood that \\n       things are not as they seem and the city is emanating the curse Kaho is trying to stop. Now it's up to her \\n       to stop the curse in karst in order to prevent her village from being destroyed. \\n\\n-Gameplay-:\\n      \\n       The gameplay in Momodora is like a standard metroidvania with a twist of Dark Souls. You are fighting \\n       enemies while making your way jumping and hopping on platforms to boss fights. Progression is made by \\n       finding items and upgrades to your characters to unlock other areas. You have a set number of \\n       collectibles that you can use to unlock side quests and power up your character with more items. These \\n       collectibles are in every areas in the game and some are hidden pretty well behind fake walls or using \\n       hidden platforms to get up to them. \\n\\n\\n-Graphics/Sound-:\\n\\n       The game has a pixel art style that is refreshing to look at and strengthens the cute atmosphere. The \\n       environments are deep and well constructed. The animations are fluid and are impressive. The music of \\n       the game is really nice and meshes really well with the environment and the event occuring to the player. \\n       Boss themes are epic and inspiring while the background themes are reminiscent of the areas they are \\n       tied to. \\n\\n-Story-:\\n\\n       The Story of Momodora isn't that deep, but is still a good one. A young priestess is sacrificing her own \\n       wellbeing (and in some endings her life) for her homeland's safety. Along with meeting and helping out \\n       victims of the curse in several sidequests. It's an inspiring tale where the weak can become strong in order \\n       to protect their friends, family and comrades. \\n\\n\\n\\nGameplay: 10/10\\nGraphics/sound/ 9/10\\nStory: 9/10\\n\\nOverall: 93/100\\n\\ntl;dr\\n\\nGame is cute, game is good, buy the cute good game\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a very good game. The Sprites are beautifully made, and well animated. The level design is superb and really fun to navigate through. Momodora also has an oppressive atmosphere that will seem to choke you at times as you feel the dread and despair from the environment and the characters of the game. Momodora has outstanding music, and I will be purchasing the soundtrack at a later date. This game does follow a story line from a series of games. But as far as I'm aware you don't have to play those to get a full experience from this game's story; as it seems mostly self-contained, but I could be wrong.\\n\\n My main issue with Momodora is that the game is on the short side. You can beat it in about five hours in your first play through. However, there is a new game+ option and a hard/insane mode; that will increase the game time and make an already tough game even harder. I also feel as though there was also a couple of bullshit moments with the enemy placement in the later levels; The one I remember most is that damn witch in the sewers.  However, most of the difficulty problems I ran into was because of my own skill. As this game does require you to use your brain to memorize enemies attack patterns.\\n\\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight at $10 is a purchase very well made. A solid 8/10 it is a must own for any MetriodVania type fans.\\n\",\n",

       "   'review': \"There's a lot of things going for this game. Music, atmosphere, item collection, diverse enemies, etc. but one severe drawback from my pov.\\nThe game is challenging but not necessarily in a healthy way. Enemies are positioned to attack where it came off as frustrating. With game design, players shouldn't need to approach a new area cautiously for negative surprises - we should clearly see and adapt without needing to die over and over unless we've memorized enemy layouts when they're unclear. It's the (main) difference between Super Mario versus the Syoban Cat game. This game felt as if it was developed to have more 'random' risks than reward.\\nTo be fair, I only played an hour and a half on writing this review, but here are some examples from what I've seen:\\n- A wolf breaks out of a box that begins shaking when you approach it. However, the pixel art and lack of ambient lighting in that location made the wolf unapparent\\n- Witches began firing before they appeared in the player's fov. There are multiple audio cues for when they fire, but having to rely on that is a bad accessibility move. \\n- Enemies apparated/spawned in undeclared locations, which includes the location the player may currently be standing at\\n\\nOne thing that may be worth noting is that I chose the 'hard' difficulty - but that shouldn't matter with a game design heuristic that applies across the board. Enemies inflicting more damage or having larger hp pools scaling with difficulty makes sense - that's a separate topic from the issue addressed above. At any given difficulty, the issue would still stand; the only difference was that I probably died much more often than had it been on an easier difficulty. \\nThe overall combat mechanics make it interesting enough for me to give the game a few more hours of playtime in case this is just an issue of me needing to 'git gud'. And I'll still possibly purchase their upcoming 2019 title, where hopefully the same issue doesn't persist (the trailers look great so far).\\nAs a huge fan of this genre, I'm still very eager to see what Bombservice has in store!\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Love the atmosphere, soundtrack, graphics, and most of all the gameplay.\\n\\nIt's a bit like a 2d Bloodborne. Not quite as difficult, but still challenging. There are three difficulty settings, so obviously if you're used to Souls-like difficulty, go with hard, but normal was just right for me personally. The life-death cycle is also much faster than a Souls game, and the checkpoints feel like they were well spaced-out considering how long it takes me to run out of heals, or how often I die.\\n\\nI'm at 3.5 hrs so far, but I think I've only uncovered about 50% of the map so far. $10 USD feels about right considering the amount of fun you can get out of it, so $5 on sale made it a steal IMO.\\n\\nIt also helps that you can run it on a potato. My Macbook Pro can't even run Civ 5 on minimal settings without the fan kicking in, but this game runs like a breeze, even on the high graphic settings.\\n\\nAlso, I thoroughly enjoyed the surprise boss fights!

       "   'review': \"There's only so much you can take before accepting that it just isn't fun.\\n\\nEditing this review to add more detail. I've finished the game several times since, and it deserves at least that much.\\n\\nI normally like Metroidvania titles that only get easier as you progress, but the reason isn't because the starting zone is so ridiculously difficult to pass through. This game makes that mistake, populating the first cluster of areas you pass through with shield imps who are basically nigh-impossible to actually kill, paired with poison-throwing imps who carpet-bomb much ground (or anything vaguely near you) and are very annoying to avoid (and as it later turned out, these were the only armored and poison-inflicting enemies in the entire game). Maybe my inexperience with combat-oriented Metroidvanias is showing but I wasted way too much time trying to kill everything and constantly dying in this zone, and even when I shifted focus to just getting through without dying, it was still painful. At least this became less of an issue once I got into the next zone and started collecting more items.\\n\\nI don't hate the Souls-inspired design like the occasional bonfires and You Died screen, but after anywhere from a dozen to a hundred deaths, Kaho's final scream started driving me crazy.  The only way this would've been acceptable to put in would be if Dark Souls had also had the player character emit a similar sound on death.\\n\\nMy final gripe is the story. Not the whole thing, just parts of it. While it apparently continues a trend in the series of a matriarchal world where the people are accustomed to solving all problems with sacrifices, this particular game mostly offers an excuse plot. A darkness grips the land, so you enter a cursed place to end the source of it all, which turns out to be the result of a deal with the devil. (Sound familiar?) Once you venture far enough you're told to gather a total of 4 fragments (actually 3, since you collect one right then) of an item which for some reason are guarded by the very enemies of the Queen and/or Church (the Pardoner and Derelict respectively, and the Arsonist would qualify as both). Who even knows why one fragment was hidden on a spiritual plane?\\n\\nThis game does do a lot well, like easier enemies after the first couple of areas, rare/unique rewards for flawless (no-hit) boss fights which help immensely when obtained as early as they are, collectibles to upgrade health and get even more useful items (although there is a limit to their usefulness as you only have 3 active item slots and 2 passive item slots, and using more than 3 actives in the same timespan would require constantly switching items during a skirmish). There's also an optional extra boss if you want one more offensive spell in your inventory (or just seek one more fight), because the boss fights are just that well-designed.\\n\\nThe boss fights are what makes this game, and that there are so few of them is a shame. (At least the game's base price is low to reflect that.) On my first playthrough I forgot about my extra items and fought most of them vanilla (on later runs, using items, especially the ones dropped by previous bosses, made them a walk in the park on all difficulties), and it was an awesome experience even with all the deaths. The fights were impressively animated and designed, with tight controls and fair i-frames in rolling/dashing (in Easy mode the i-frames are even more generous).\\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this, unless you really like Metroidvanias and don't mind the difficulty curve being the opposite of conventional (stupidly hard -> easier, instead of easy -> harder).\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I really loved this game. It is a short and sweet addition to the metroidvania genre that i found strangely addicting. A normal playthrough would take about 3-4 hours, but I have beaten the game 4 times to get all of the achievements (and because I just really enjoy it). It has beautiful art style and sound design with challenging gameplay and plenty of secrets to keep you busy. Nothing felt BS from bosses to normal enemies to level design, and I have yet to discover any bugs. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nIt is a good game that was well worth the money, especially if you love the metroidvania genre.',\n",

       "   'review': \"I've been wanting to check this game out ever since I saw it in a YouTube video a couple of years ago, and now that I finally got around to play it I've got to say that it is quite a nice experience.\\n\\nI won't go on for too long, so I'll just go over the aspects of this game that I liked the most, starting by the gameplay, this game feels like a mix between a metroidvania and a souls game, it's not very long, a normal playthrough can take you around 4 and a half hours to beat (that's what it took me), however it has a ng+ and different difficulty settings (including a 1 hit death insane mode if you really hate yourself!), plus some stuff to find around the map, so it has some replay value.\\n\\nThe other part of the gameplay I want to talk about is the difficulty, I personally didn't find the normal difficulty THAT difficult (just some fairly normal challenge here and there), I haven't tried the hard difficulty so take what I said with a grain of salt (however, I can recall that video saying that the hard mode is quite evil) might update this review once I get around to beat it.\\n\\n[strike]Some of the hitboxes are pretty weird however, it doesn't break the experience or anything I just thought it would be important to say [/strike]\\n\\nNow let's talk about controls, they are simple, fluent and easy to learn, the dodge can take some getting used to, but it really isn't that big of a deal. The combat probably isn't that deep, all you will be doing is mashing the X and B button (if you are using an Xbox controller, like I did) and dodging when necessary, but it does its job and it didn't get old for me, the bosses will make sure you have to think about your movements and strategy.\\n\\nTalking about the bosses, a thing I had with them is that I found the difficulty curve is a little off, some bosses are considerably harder than others, and the final boss is kinda easy (this is in normal difficulty, I haven't tried hard mode yet, so again, take it with a grain of salt), so if you really want a challenge my advice is to go directly to the hard difficulty.\\n\\nLet's see, what more... well, the graphics are nice and the designs are cute, the protagonist's animations are particularly well done; might not be the best looking game of its kind, but still looks good. The music is alright, a bit unmemorable maybe, most tracks are very ambiental, but it doesn't really matter, it fits the game and that's enough, at least for me.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it's not the densest, deepest or longest game I've ever played, but for the price it's a really pleasing experience that will leave you satisfied after the credits roll, and with some replay value if you want to extract all of the juice from it, just get used to the dying animation.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"The fourth installment of the Momodora series and the best [spoiler] so far [/spoiler], developer Bombservice takes all the best parts of the previous game and improves upon the formula reaching new heights, offering a game much larger in scope, longer, with more action, a bigger interconnected world to explore, wonderful boss fights, more interactions and overall higher quality of an already great series. \\n\\nThe amazing art consists of a wide variety of immersive locations/backgrounds, from sunny forests to gloomy cursed cities and abandoned castles, inhabited by some nasty-but-cute enemies. The pixel-art animation is fluid, detailed and highly expressive. The music is also a great mix of epic, calm , intense and somber pieces that compliment the story. \\nAnd while the story is presented in a minimalistic style it still manages to evoke the melancholic and sometimes depressing nature of the Momodora series - do not let youself be deceived by the cute and colorful pixel art style, the world of Momodora is dark and somber where happiness is hard to achieve. But with some hope still lingering.\\nMake sure you explore the map thoroughly in order to achieve a more satisfying ending too!\\n\\nI didn't encounter any bugs, gamepad worked as intended (for me at least!). As for the gameplay, you can choose various difficulties if you feel you want a bigger challenge (the default normal was no walk in the park either and resulted in many game over screens but nothing extremely frustrating) and afetr you finish the game you have a NG+ with higher difficulty and different enemy placement, while you get to keep your inventory.\\n\\nFor fans of metroidvania platformers, Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a small gem that you should not miss.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I can only recommend this game if you're a huge fan of metroidvania/dark souls-esque games and have already played though all the better ones. It's the equivalent of comfort food- probably not good, but it satisfies a craving. (As an aside, this is my entry point into the series, so keep that in mind)\\n\\nI'll start with the things I liked about it. The world concept was really fun, and I enjoyed the theming of the main character. It really made me want to see what her homeland was like, since it's only talked about in the game. I also enjoyed the way the bow works, and I thought that the charge mechanic was a good idea, sacrificing time to get a wider range/more damage.\\n\\nHowever, there are entirely too many faults to make it worth enjoying. I'll just list them in bullet point form to save time.\\n- The scale was too small. I didn't want to just hear about the main character's homeland, I wanted to see it for myself, and levels felt extremely small and exceedingly linear for a metroidvania\\n- The movement was somehow too floaty and too clunky at the same time, and you were slower and didn't jump as high as you should have in my opinion\\n- The melee range was awkwardly short and led to a lot of unfair hits\\n- It was too hard to dodge out of the way of enemies once you had committed to your combo which again led to a lot of unfair hits\\n- The enemies were not really designed with your toolkit in mind (I was able to snipe the first 2-3 bosses with my bow because there was nothing punishing me for snipecamping)\\n- There were a lot of moments that lacked polish and showed there was a lack of playtesting, such as enemies having such similar designs to the point that you could easily confuse them for one another, to there being awkward choke points where you take hits that feel unfair, to probably even more if I had continued to play\\n- Mediocre graphics and music. I don't remember a single thing about what the game sounded like, the pixel art felt extremely run of the mill, the pallete was muddy and generic, there were talk portraits so you didn't know what any of the characters' faces looked like, etc.\\n- And finally, an absolute lack of originality mechanics wise. They literally just copied the bonfire and estus flask system from Dark Souls and the upgrade/item system from Metroid. The best I can say about it is that only having 2 slots for passive items was kind of interesting, but the effects were not dramatic enough to cause you any sort of trouble deciding what to put there- and the fact that you can swap it out on the fly as you need makes it a moot point anyway.\\n\\nUltimately if you REALLY, REALLY like this kind of game... go get Hollow Knight instead. It does everything this game wants to but 10x better and it's probably 5x longer. But if you already did that and this game is on sale, then knock yourself out? I'd say its just barely worth 5$ if you're a fan.\",\n",

Have you wanted to play a game that looks like anime but not the ones where the women in the game are 90% big boobs but women that look normal size? Then this game is for you.\\nTo honest I little worry about the females in this game having animated females. But thanks to the artist and SNES style of graphics making not only look nice but the artist have made them look like women and not sexual hentai girls. \\n\\nMetroidvania is this gameplay style done well. you get two weapons the bow and the leaf, now it might not sound like the leaf would make a good weapon but its more like megaman x when zero swings his Z saber fast and strong plus it can stun enemies. The bow can charge shot up to two levels, level 1 boost damage, level 2 shotgun arrows. \\n\\nAs for the levels its more castlevania where you explore to find more lay outs to open new routes to get around to bosses or saves or shops.\\n\\nThe story is just right to tell you what you need to get done. Your a young priestess that wants to save her home and stop the curse from destroying all life. Simple and ready to go. No long waiting for cutscene\\'s or any of \"Triple AAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYeeeeeee\" Bullsh#t of making you feel bored.',\n",

       "   'review': \"A very pleasant, although rather short metroidvania. The visuals are really pretty in motion, I'm not a fan of the overuse of pixel art in platforming games, but the quality of animations and some visual effects definitely made up for it.\\n\\nBoss fights are enjoyable, a bit challenging sometimes, but rewarding. The items available make quite a difference in combat and movement, giving it a good feeling of progression. Music is rather ambient, yet helps in building the gloom fairy-tale atmosphere.\\nFor those who like to dig a bit in available text, there is some lore to uncover, even if not a lot of it.\\n\\nNG+ didn't change that much as I played it, some enemy placements pretty much. The challenges for achievements are rather tricky, would require finishing a game good few times to master it.\\n\\nOverall it's a well done little game, one that I'll probably get back to, especially since it doesn't require as much time investment as other metroidvanias.\\n\\n+Those are really good looking thighs for just a few pixels used.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Story: Starts with priestess which uses red leaf to fight called kaho from sacred village arriving before karst city (sound like a pun to me for a word cursed) to stop curse from spreading that has been spreading across the land and her village.\\nTo eliminate the curse, she needs to defeat the queen. Some items often tells bits of plot too, similar to Dark Souls.\\nThere are two ending to the game, to achieve the best ending possible you need to find pond which you need to soak in the leaf you fight with and you get green leaf back which is more powerfull weapon from red leaf. It gets pretty dark in the more you progress. There are some hidden quests troughout the story like helping the skeleton man find his love again just to find her in her grave and if you visit him later, you will see his atire on her grave with him missing. This is the forth installment of the series momodora with this one being the better and most polished.\\n\\nSoundtrack: For this game is amazing, it sounds so mysterious and eerie and i love it. They are really well done and really fit the game. \\nThere is in total 21 soundtracks inside the game and they are all made by Elektobear.\\n\\nGameplay: Difficult, but a lot of fun. Controls feels great and character feels very responsive.You use arrow keys to move, A to jump or double jump if you press it two times,S to melee and mash it for triple combo attack, D To use arrows and latter you have upgrades that enchaces or when holdind D you charge arrows for greater spread and damage, Q for rolls which you use to dodge enemies and make yourself faster and you latter unlock air dodge which makes it even faster and W for changing items. Game is platformer metroidvania which means that you choose where you want to go with and that there a lot of items to collect.  Some you can't collect right away since you need required power ups (like the cat sphere to get trough the tight spaces) to get to them, and some are hidden like in the hidden wall in the beggining of the game. Boss battles are most difficult parts of the game, especially on harder difficulties.\\nHardest boss in the game is definitly the queen which you need to defeat her 3 times in a row. Some items can be purchased for currency called munnies which enemys drop when they are killed. Collectables in the game are Ivory bugs which you trade off to bunny in whiteleaf memorial park, Health container which expands you hp a bit then collectables you get for taking no damage during boss battles which are usually very good items you can equip. There are 4 difficulties in the game, easy, normal, hard and insane. Trying to beat insane is very, very challanging, basically to beat it you need to go trough everything in game without being touched once on highest difficulty. Game is about 6 hours long or even more if you are completionist.\\n\\nArt: It has that 16-bit anime-ish art and it looks beautifull. Amount of details to the characters and everything around makes it feel gorgeous. Feels good just looking the main character moving around. Background has some movements but not too much like lights in some levels or swinging roses and slight shading of the background to darker then brighter (examle from whiteleaf memorial park), there are alot of particles that floats around like in karst city some white stuff, i assume snow. When screen moves with you the background moves with you too and i love when games do that.\\n\\nI highly recommend this game to fans of platformers and anyone interested in these kind of games. it is totally worth its full price even when not on sale.\\n\\nThanks for reading.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I\\'m giving this a positive review so you\\'ll maybe check out the game if you read this, but the game deserves a \"meh\" more than a positive or negative, because frankly it\\'s both at the same time. \\n\\nTLDR: Good mechanics, movement, and overall core aspects, atrocious game design. Like, wow, the game design in this game is bad. Not bad enough to make it not worth checking out, but seriously this is a steam sale purchase, don\\'t spend more than 5 or so dollars on this game. It\\'s really short, repetitive, and annoying in how its designed. Definitely one of those games that warrants a \"meh\" option on steam. \\n\\na little longer TLDR: Difficulty is really poorly executed in this game, but the mechanics and gameplay are solid enough that I didn\\'t hate the experience, despite a lot of bosses just kind of being cheap and poorly balanced. They do too much damage, don\\'t take enough damage to warrant their damage output (unlike how in Dark Souls nothing usually feels like it takes too long to kill, and it never feels like their damage output and moveset is straight poorly designed). I give it a loose recommendation because the movement is fun and fast paced, but I\\'d probably rather play Salt and Sanctuary if I wanted a \"Dark Souls in 2D\" experience. And yes, this very much is a Dark Souls in 2D game, and I\\'m not just saying that because it\\'s hard. \\n\\nThe review: So I\\'ll start by saying I haven\\'t technically finished the game at the time of writing this (though I have about 75 percent map completion, and there\\'s really not very much backtracking in this game so I\\'m going to assume I\\'m about 75 percent of the way through the main content, which in a game like this is enough to give a rough recommendation), so if that\\'s a deal breaker for you feel free to skip this review now (Edit: I am at the final boss now, and I completely stand by what I say in this review). \\n\\nThat said, I can give this game a loose recommendation. The mechanics and gameplay is overall really solid. You know that saying of \"it\\'s the Dark Souls of ____\"? Well this is the Dark Souls of Metroidvanias (though truthfully if you want something even closer to a Dark Souls of Metroidvanias, play Salt and Sanctuary; it\\'s like 2D dark souls in every sense of the word, all the way down to not having a map you can look at). At least sort of. There\\'s bells that act like bonfires, there\\'s these spikey seed things that act like estus flasks and replenish every time you rest at a bell, you die in 1-2 hits, etc. Which brings me to my next point, and biggest complaint about this game, which is that you die in 1-2 hits (though I am playing on the hard setting). \\n\\nIt\\'s not even that the bosses are particularly difficult to beat, but when you die in 1 hit at full hit points, yeah, that\\'s kind of not good game design. In a game like Dark Souls, if a move is going to kill you in one hit, it\\'s going to let you know it\\'s coming first. There\\'ll be a big wind up and you\\'ll have a year to get out of the way.\\n\\nIn this game if the bosses so much as scratch their fucking nutsacks, woop zoop sloop it\\'s back to the bell for you! And pretty much every boss is like this. Very little start up, kills you in one hit. To add insult to injury, the estus seeds (Idk what their name actually is so I\\'ma call \\'em that for this review) don\\'t level up as far as I\\'m aware in terms of how much they heal, and I\\'m 75 percent of the way through the game and I\\'ve had 5 for 90 percent of my playtime. They also heal fucking pathetic amounts of health. Like, if you take one hit you end up using literally half your estus just so you can survive another hit. \\n\\nEdit: Okay so as I\\'m writing this review, I pulled up the items page, and yeah I missed a few of the bellflowers (estus flasks), but my point still stands that in a game where you can\\'t upgrade your hit points through leveling and need to find powerups to do that, dying in one hit from low lag attacks is still just not great game design. I mean I get that it\\'s easy to just have a game kill you in one hit instead of actually balancing difficulty, but frankly if you want a brutally hard souls-like metroidvania I\\'d recommend Salt and Sanctuary or Hollow Knight (though frankly neither of those are brutally hard IMO, but they\\'re certainly harder than your average video game). \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a good time, but the difficulty spikes during the boss fights just becomes unfun after a while, as you get tired of getting really close to killing something and then dying in one hit because maybe you aren\\'t completely perfect and the bosses attacks aren\\'t super telegraphed a lot of the time. You just feel like you got cheated out of a victory more times than you feel like you genuinely lost because you fucked up. \\n\\nAnd no, this isn\\'t a case of \"Git Gud\", so go eat a fuckin shoe you darn tootin\\' hooligans.',\n",

       "   'review': \"At first I thought this game was really hard until I realized your items are replenished when you save. Kind of like the Etus Flask from Dark Souls. After that I had a much better time.\\n\\nThe presentation is certainly neat. Graphics, animations, sound effects, music... it's all good.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I find the level design rather lacking. The layout of the map and the teleport spots don't seem very thoughtfully picked. Neither do the enemy placements. The second time you encounter the mages (or witches, whatever) you get hit from a source you can't even see because the screen is so big and there are other enemies to take care of before. At that point it is too early to ask the player to pay attention to what is telegraphed via sound.\\n\\nAlso some enemies don't even turn around when you hit them in the back. They didn't expect you to backtrack even though this is a metroidvania game.\\n\\nYou open up some shortcuts to straighten out your way from the save point to the boss, which is nice. \\n\\nThere are some secrets, collectibles / upgrades and equipment but I find that pretty shallow. You learn exactly one more move, the rest is available from the start and it's not very deep. Oh yeah, you can turn into a cat but that is also underwhelming. Also, the game is not that long. Aria of Sorrow or what have you is twice its size.\\n\\nIt's not like the game is without merits. There is fun to be had... as long as you keep your expectations under control. And I wouldn't spend more than 5 bucks on it.\",\n",

Here's a long list of cons.\\n\\n- checkpoints are handled terribly, never placed close by major parts of the game and the game doesn't have the decency to save/heal after bosses which can lead to some obnoxious cancer where you die immediately after a long as hell fight and have to go through the same 11 rooms all over again while trying not to take damage just to try again\\n- enemies don't drop anything except money. there's an item to change that to restoring a bit of health. you can't have both and they don't drop any consumable refills so after a short while there's hardly any reason to kill them\\n- the highest damaging moves bosses can do are the ones that are the hardest to react to\\n- bosses in general are excessively basic, with one move you won't get hit by, one move that's obnoxious, and then one fair one. some of them just shrug off your bow for no reason and others make close combat such a risk that you have to hang back and shoot them like it's devil may cry 2\\n- there's one boss that has an enemy in the bit of the room prior to the arena and that enemy will make the fight immensely painful if not genuinely impossible if you decide not to kill it.\\n- most of the game is just trial and error and after a while you'll just air dash through most of the game recklessly because combat isn't worth it and you're getting bored\\n- too many instant kill spikes and death pits creating artificial difficulty, padding, and causing you to die in otherwise harmless rooms and lose progress because you thought this game wouldn't let you die there\\n- finding out how to progress often boils down to wandering aimlessly until you find one off room you missed that was hiding a major collectible (final crest, the transformation to get under small walkways) or how to progress further (that one sky area place)\\n- two of four major upgrades are useless bow upgrades, the other is a fast travel option you'll probably get *last* when you've known about it since the first bell checkpoint (the warp)\\n- it's a metroidvania but most of the items you get are either basic stat change active items or whatever passives you'll forget about and most of them are bought, not found. health upgrades are hidden and there's tiny little 4 pixel bug collectibles that only give you money\\n- speaking of buying items, the amount of money you have to grind just to get anything worthwhile is ridiculous\\n- there's multiple difficulties but it just lowers your health and maybe adds enemies which is the worst way to make this game different. there's also a new game+ for some reason that adds the same enemies.\\n- super easy to miss the true ending and both endings are depressing anyway, you either die and accomplish nothing or fade from existence to save a land with nothing in it but dead people and cardboard characters\\n- there's a boss in here where you have to hit the real enemy out of an increasing group of clones but it boils down to a dumb luck timesink that'll make you want to stop playing and then you find out that's the second-to-last boss\\n- music isn't memorable at all, not even the boss theme. nothing to hum or listen to after playing.\\n- the game opens very pretty but then every area after that is dark, bland, or depressing. too much grey and brick everywhere.\\n- nonexistent story, no character or encounter has any noticeable significance and there's no background lore to supplement it\\n\\nThis game is grossly overrated. Poor by Metroidvania standards and littered with bad design decisions. Look at the features list on the store page. Pretty much everything on there is an enormous exaggeration if not an outright lie. Even the part about the graphics, they're not much. You probably bought it because of the one boss girl with big breasts. She dies unceremoniously. There I just saved you anywhere from five to ten dollars. Buy something else. Buy Iconoclasts. Buy an actual Metroid or Dark Souls game. Buy Rabi-Ribi. Just not this, Jesus Christ.\\n\\nedit: *more hearts\",\n",

       "   'review': '[b] Got this game from Humble Bundle for a couple of bucks, and I\\'d have to say that it\\'s probably better at that price. [/b]\\n\\nSo here\\'s the issue with Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight; it is not a bad game, but with all the issues that the game has as a whole, there\\'s no way I can recommend buying it for $10, not while at the same looking at the competition it\\'s dealing with.\\n\\nTL;DR: Wait for a sale, this game is not worth buying at $10\\n\\n[h1] This Game is Padded Out to Hell [/h1]\\nThis game is extremely short, even by Metroidvania standards. Don\\'t let my 5ish hours fool you into thinking this is a long game as the majority of that playtime was done doing the padded out collect-a-thon that I\\'ll get to later; trust me when I say you can easily finish this game in less than 40 minutes if you really tried to. The way Momodora tries to get you to not do so however is tricking the player into spending time doing other stuff instead of just finishing the game.\\n\\nFor example, the game forces you to grab 4 power-ups scattered at the 4 corners of the map so you can progress to the final boss. 2 out of the 4 are useless bow upgrades that you will most likely never use, 1 of them is an unlock that allows you to go into half of the map for unlocks, and the last one is the ability to warp between checkpoints.\\n\\nYes, the ability to warp is locked behind an unlock you can potentially miss while playing the game, yes that\\'s a lot of backtracking if you potentially don\\'t grab it, no you are not told where these are, and no it\\'s not obvious where these upgrades are. When you have a game that has as big of a map as this one where backtracking can potentially inhale so much of your time, why the hell is teleportation locked from the start? Even then, teleporting is limited at that as you can\\'t teleport to every checkpoint, only a set few of them. It\\'s not hard to backtrack through the game, it\\'s just like why?\\n\\n[h1] Collecting Is a Chore [/h1]\\nLike many other metroidvanias, Momodora has a ton of collectibles to grab and a ton of ways to hide them from you. Now I understand how subjective this can be and it might just sound like I\\'m bad and I\\'m just whining but let me bring up two other games that do collecting fantastically, those being Hollow Knight and essentially the entire Metroid franchise. In Hollow Knight there are tons of collectibles as well and they all make a unique sound while you\\'re in the room with them. While you might not be able to grab them at the moment, you know they\\'re there and can come back to them. Metroid has a different approach by altering the surroundings themselves to show you that something is hidden. Maybe there\\'s cracks in a wall, maybe it\\'s blocked by a door you can\\'t open yet, you know something is there and like Hollow Knight, you can come back to it if you can\\'t figure it out at the moment.\\n\\nMomodora doesn\\'t do either of these. Rather than, you know, making collecting fun, Momodora has illusory walls that look like every other wall, \"invisible platforms\", and tiny as hell collectibles that you can potentially miss if you\\'re not paying attention. The game does however offer a way to help you notice these hidden objects, but even Momodora finds a way to mess it up. It comes in the form of an item that you have to equip, therefore blocking you from using another item in it\\'s place and it makes a sound that blends in with all the other sounds of the game or a vibration if you\\'re on controller.\\n\\nSo basically, if you\\'re not using controller like I was while playing this game, you can be playing the game listening for a sound that might never come up because you just flat out don\\'t know what it sounds like and miss so many of the collectibles the game has to offer. Like why? How hard is it to turn up the volume of the sound? How hard is it to give some indication that these walls can break away? How hard is it to make these collectibles just a little bit bigger?\\n\\nYou\\'re going to be running around big rooms just ramming yourself into walls trying to find some hidden thing because the game just flat out doesn\\'t want you find what it\\'s hiding, and even then the thing it might be hiding could just be completely useless!\\n\\nI think I\\'ve made my point that this isn\\'t worth the money. Here\\'s a couple of other metroidvanias that you\\'re probably enjoy more than Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight. If you can find this game for less than $10 then pick it up, it\\'s fine. But compared to the competition? Nah.\\n\\nSuper Metroid / Metroid Fusion - Free just emulate them\\nHollow Knight - $15\\nOri and the Blind Forest - $20\\n\\nAll of these offer way more content for your time than Momodora ever could without cheating you for it',\n",

       "'Metroidvania with some influences from Dark Souls. I enjoyed it. I had to check some guide to see the true ending. It\\'s ok. Frustrating mechanics turned me off of the game. Definitely feels slow and clunky when fighting. Not a bad game just a m e h it\\'s alright game. Ultimately there\\'s better games to play. Cat Has problems but overall pretty good. I\\'d suggest you don\\'t play on easy even if you\\'re REALLY bad like me as it\\'s... Well, too easy This is a very good and very short game. If you have ever wanted a 2d platformer with some soulslike mechanics such as rolling, save points and refillable items, then there is a decent chance you will enjoy your time on it. It combines that with an interesting story with fun (and relatively easy) bosses all wrapped up in a metroidvania package. I did have some minor issues with the game such as the way spawn points were set and the warp mechanic. The warp system only takes you to a specific bell in an area and you have to work your way through enemies to get to whichever bell you need to be at to progress. This was somewhat frustrating at times considering that this game does promote backtracking in order to find special items and collectibles. This was coupled with the fact that warping doesn\\'t set your spawn point to the bell you warped to, meaning you also have to make sure you set your spawn in case you die. Other than that, it was a fun and short game. A short but sweet metroidvania that is worth your time, especially if you like getting difficult achievements! awooooo Fun game, but a bit too easy imo Momodora: RUtM is the 4th game in the series and easily the best. It\\'s a 2-d action platformer with a simple yet rewarding combat system and difficulty options aplenty. The game is pretty short, about 4 hours on my first play-through (on switch). If you play on normal, I would recommend a second play-through on insane, which adds enemies and drastically lowers the player health bar. Other than that, there isn\\'t a ton of replay value unless you want to find all the hidden collectibles. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this game. . Short but sweet It\\'s really fun! If you like games like Rabi-Ribi or Metroidvania  games in general you\\'d def like this game!! Man, it\\'s short enuf that my monke brain was able to finish it twice within 7.4hrs. Pacifist achievement tho..enemies just decide that suicide is the best route so it becomes part of your kill count :\\'( This game is awesome, it has great art design and an insane diffculty, when played on hard mode, it become a personal fave for its la dark souls but in 16 bit A charming and difficult pixel action platformer. really loveable 2d metroidvania exploration game. animations feel very polished I didn\\'t expect to love this game as much as I do now.\\nThe boss fights felt so smooth, were rewarding, and had great music to them.\\nWorth the pain of repeated deaths for a perfect boss fight. The good: interesting world. I like the music. You can kill enemies with a leaf! Not too long, not too difficult.\\nThe bad: story isn\\'t much. Some sound effects were mistimed.\\nOverall enjoyable. Good game [h1] An Important Note     [/h1]\\nSpecial thanks to my buddy Jp. For a good palate cleanser of a game.\\n\\n[h1]One Priestess to Stop a Deadly Curse [/h1]\\nBasic premise/Story\\n\\nFrom developer studio, Bombservice and directed rdein. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie metroidvania where you play as a young priestess named Kaho as she journeys to the eastern kingdom of Karst to stop a curse that has been corrupting nearby lands including her village. \\n\\n[h1]A Leaf and a Bow? [/h1]\\nUnique Gameplay\\n\\nThe game oozes with 2D bit aesthetics that are both charming and minimalistic. There weren\\'t a whole lot of systems involved to remember. Except using a bow and your leaf to attack enemies, consumables option and even some handy items/spells you can use during combat. Each giving off a passive or active effect. Momodora doesn’t even take that long to beat with my playthrough clocking at just a little bit over four hours. With 99% map completion. The music, while subtle, helped give to life many areas you will visit throughout the map in Momodora. Yet it doesn’t overstay its welcome. There are plenty of save options nearby to save your progress and restore your health and consumables while on the go. Usually bringing up the map and going back to places you previously couldn’t enter is recommended once you gain a key ability that will allow the player to traverse into the new zone. Making backtracking a breeze and using new abilities to traverse is fun. \\n\\n[h1]Moving the Curtain Aside.[/h1]\\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\\n\\nTo my utter surprise I was quite captivated by Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. It’s been some time since I played a metroidvania game and I was hooked by how minimalistic the game details its world, inhabitants, lore and more without saying too much. While I would appreciate some more world-building to flesh out the game some more. I believe Momodora does an adequate job in selling the game’s premise to fans. There is no need to saturate the game further when it would break the balance and momentum of what the game already tries to convey to the player. Not much I can critique on the game, besides wishing for more music tracks. The gameplay was simple and effective by relying on the mechanics given at the start. Players can go deeper with combos in tandem to combat some bosses the game throws at you. In addition to some new abilities you will gain later on to help with traversal and combat. The story surprised me deeply and I couldn’t help, but be touched by the ending. Without any context, it goes into a direction I found fitting albeit one I didn’t expect at all. Still Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a must for newcomers or veterans of the metroidvania genre looking for something new, charming and short.  \\n\\nTotal Times Beaten: 1\\nScore: 8/10 \\nDate Finished: 5/21/21\\nDate Reviewed: 5/21/21\\nHours Played: 4.14 hours\\n Quick Description:\\n-Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th entry in the Momodora series and is hands down the most polished version of the series.  This is a cute, mini metroidvania that metroidvania fans are likely going to enjoy.  It\\'s a one man team and is quite rough around the edges, but makes up for it w/ charm and engaging combat.\\n\\nWhat\\'s Good:\\n-This game has a ton of charm.  There are a lot of cute characters and npcs all over the map.  Even some of the larger than life bosses are adorable looking characters.  I like the contrast between the brutal combat and the cute characters.  There are enemies that kill in 2-3 hits and spikes that instantly kill you.  You would never expect that from such an adorable looking game.\\n-I\\'m a big fan of the pixel art.  I like the way the bosses look, the impact when you hit enemies w/ your weapons, and when small star-like currency flies out of dead enemies.  The environment itself is serviceable, although not as polished as top tier games.\\n-The boss fights are hands down the most fun and challenging part of this game.  There are a quite few bosses in this 5 hourish game.  Some of small and agile, while others are very imposing and towering above you.  These bosses hit hard and are tough.   Memorizing their patterns and equipping the right powerups are key to victory.\\n-Lots of secrets to find.  I really loved exploring the world.  This is not that big of a metroidvania and the map isn\\'t great, but traversing the world is still really fun.  You will be heavily rewarded for checking every square inch the map.  Some secrets are really obvious, while others are more obtuse.  Being able to equip more health potions, finding powerful relics, or simply gaining health can all be found if you search hard enough.\\n-You have a basic short ranged four leaf clover and a long range bow.  I loved that they chose a four leaf clover to be used as a weapon.  It\\'s small things like this that make Momodora stand out.  You can unlock powerups that make your arrows poisonous or add flames to your attacks.\\n\\nCould Use a Few Changes:\\n-Very difficult during the first 2 hrs.  You are way under-powered and thrown into the deep in.  During the first 30 minutes, there are several enemies that can 2-hit you.  Even after the first hr, there are a ton of enemies that can 3 hit you.  There are also lots of instant death spikes to avoid while platforming.  This is going to cause a lot of players to give up before really enjoying the meat of this game.\\n-Pacing could use a lot of work.  I think this game would have benefit from adding one to two more areas and making this closer to a 8 hr experience.  Basically, as of right now, you spend your first two hrs dying left and right, then by the 4 hr mark, you become an incredibly overpowered tank that can brute force its way through almost everything.  If this game were a little longer, then they could have made the beginning a bit easier, and had a longer build up until you become extremely powerful.\\n-Most people do not enjoy one hit death spikes.  They are used quite a bit here, especially in the second half of the game.  There has to be more creative ways to add new challenges to the end of the game.\\n-Some areas of the map are kind of bizarre, and you can tell that this game lacks the polish that the best in the genre have.  You will also see quite a bit of duplicate enemies throughout the game.  Some enemies from the very beginning will also be at the very end in the same form.  This is not ideal imo.\\n\\nThoughts:\\n-I\\'m glad that I finally got around to playing Momodora.  I haven\\'t played any of the other games in the series, but I\\'ve been told that this one is the best and most well rounded of the 4.  There is a final 5th game in the works which I\\'m excited to check out.  This isn\\'t a perfect game but it\\'s a competent metroidvania that fans of the genre should check out.  The dev was clearly inspired by Dark Souls and the challenging, methodical combat is one of the highlights of the game.\\n\\nConsensus:\\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  It\\'s only $10 new but is an absolute steal right now while it\\'s on sale for $4.  If you are scrambling to binge another metroidvania, than Momodora Reverie of the Moonlight is a fun one worthy of your time. i smacked a blue girls tiddies with a sword and they jiggled 10/10 Decent Metroidvania, Slightly Challenging, Janky Hitboxes on Higher Difficulties, Story wasn\\'t anything special. A well-made Metroidvania, with good flow and controls. anime tiddy Really beautiful art style and animations, but slow pacing and lack of some original gameplay features made the game feel pretty monotonous. Also I am not a fan of the music. I\\'ve experienced several headakes while I was visiting some areas that had less resonant music than others.\\nGeneraly good game, but I\\'am not really impressed. Very punishing but not in a fun way. Somehow the fights are not fun. A short but sweet metroidvania. kinda fun This is not a long game, it is not particularly well polished in some regard but it is absolutely worth playing for the tone, atmosphere and general impression. It\\'s a lovely little game A nice ~7 hour metroidvania, good pixel art, good bosses, difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating, relatively simple combat but in an enjoyable way. Fantanstic game, difficulty gets over hyped anyone could beat it if time is put in but even if you\\'re pretty good the game is every likely to kill you. and FAIRLY! there\\'s only a handful of \"kaizo\" traps and they are so few and far between. cute graphics, lit story, actual difficulty that makes you feel good when you beat a \"level\" easy 9/10 another beautiful indie that proves greatness can be had without HD graphics. fun gameplay and good writing go so far. love the game it\\'s a classic and a steal when on sale. easily worth full price and i\\'m a scrooge. Very calming and nice game good game. charming and original. really cool. plesent surprise good excellent metroidvania and cute platformer step on me kaho. awesome sauce The art direction and animations in this are my absolute favourites. The gameplay is also great. Movement is tight, and items are pretty useful, save for one or two. I also love the couple of rooms and side characters that give the world a lot more depth. It\\'s a simple little game you can finish in an hour or so, unless you\\'re going for all the secrets (there\\'s more than you think).

I did not expect it to be difficult (spoiler, you\\'ll die), but it is really fun to play and despite the frustrating difficulty scaling, its mostly skill-based and you can get really good at dodging everything. 10/10, a must play indie imo. This is an amazing Metroidvania and you should totally play it!  I got stuck on my first playthrough, but then I got better at these kinds of games, and then I was able to really enjoy playing and beating Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight.  The gameplay\\'s great, so if you like any sort of Metroidvania or platform beat-em-up, I will recommend you this. This game started off great and I really want to like it. Unfortunately, I got about an hour into the game and then four times in a row, the game crashed while entering into the next boss fight. Play as Kaho, the Priestess from the village of Lun! Lately, a terrible, terrible curse has spread across the lands, and the only way to fix it is for Kaho to travel from her homeland to the Kingdom of Karst to seek the aid of the Queen!

Until you actually find upgrades and learn attack patterns, every enemy and boss can actually be pretty tough and will kill you if you don’t pay attention. Once all the upgrades are collected, the game is much easier, but the opponents stay exactly the same. Some of the enemies you find in the beginning are the same ones you find right before the final boss room and there really could have been a bit more variety. \\nThe biggest disappointment for me had to be the endings.

Play it if you want.

      "Metroidvania with some influences from Dark Souls. I enjoyed it. I had to check some guide to see the true ending. It's ok. Frustrating mechanics turned me off of the game. Definitely feels slow and clunky when fighting. Not a bad game just a m e h it's alright game. Ultimately there's better games to play. Cat Has problems but overall pretty good. I'd suggest you don't play on easy even if you're REALLY bad like me as it's... Well, too easy This is a very good and very short game. If you have ever wanted a 2d platformer with some soulslike mechanics such as rolling, save points and refillable items, then there is a decent chance you will enjoy your time on it. It combines that with an interesting story with fun (and relatively easy) bosses all wrapped up in a metroidvania package. I did have some minor issues with the game such as the way spawn points were set and the warp mechanic. The warp system only takes you to a specific bell in an area and you have to work your way through enemies to get to whichever bell you need to be at to progress. This was somewhat frustrating at times considering that this game does promote backtracking in order to find special items and collectibles. This was coupled with the fact that warping doesn't set your spawn point to the bell you warped to, meaning you also have to make sure you set your spawn in case you die. Other than that, it was a fun and short game. A short but sweet metroidvania that is worth your time, especially if you like getting difficult achievements! awooooo Fun game, but a bit too easy imo Momodora: RUtM is the 4th game in the series and easily the best. It's a 2-d action platformer with a simple yet rewarding combat system and difficulty options aplenty. The game is pretty short, about 4 hours on my first play-through (on switch). If you play on normal, I would recommend a second play-through on insane, which adds enemies and drastically lowers the player health bar. Other than that, there isn't a ton of replay value unless you want to find all the hidden collectibles. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this game. . Short but sweet It's really fun! If you like games like Rabi-Ribi or Metroidvania  games in general you'd def like this game!! Man, it's short enuf that my monke brain was able to finish it twice within 7.4hrs. Pacifist achievement tho..enemies just decide that suicide is the best route so it becomes part of your kill count :'( This game is awesome, it has great art design and an insane diffculty, when played on hard mode, it become a personal fave for its la dark souls but in 16 bit A charming and difficult pixel action platformer. really loveable 2d metroidvania exploration game. animations feel very polished I didn't expect to love this game as much as I do now.\n",

      "\n",
      "From developer studio, Bombservice and directed rdein. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie metroidvania where you play as a young priestess named Kaho as she journeys to the eastern kingdom of Karst to stop a curse that has been corrupting nearby lands including her village. \n",

      "Unique Gameplay\n",
      "\n",
      "The game oozes with 2D bit aesthetics that are both charming and minimalistic. There weren't a whole lot of systems involved to remember. Except using a bow and your leaf to attack enemies, consumables option and even some handy items/spells you can use during combat. Each giving off a passive or active effect. Momodora doesn’t even take that long to beat with my playthrough clocking at just a little bit over four hours. With 99% map completion. The music, while subtle, helped give to life many areas you will visit throughout the map in Momodora. Yet it doesn’t overstay its welcome. There are plenty of save options nearby to save your progress and restore your health and consumables while on the go. Usually bringing up the map and going back to places you previously couldn’t enter is recommended once you gain a key ability that will allow the player to traverse into the new zone. Making backtracking a breeze and using new abilities to traverse is fun. \n",

      "\n",
      "To my utter surprise I was quite captivated by Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. It’s been some time since I played a metroidvania game and I was hooked by how minimalistic the game details its world, inhabitants, lore and more without saying too much. While I would appreciate some more world-building to flesh out the game some more. I believe Momodora does an adequate job in selling the game’s premise to fans. There is no need to saturate the game further when it would break the balance and momentum of what the game already tries to convey to the player. Not much I can critique on the game, besides wishing for more music tracks. The gameplay was simple and effective by relying on the mechanics given at the start. Players can go deeper with combos in tandem to combat some bosses the game throws at you. In addition to some new abilities you will gain later on to help with traversal and combat. The story surprised me deeply and I couldn’t help, but be touched by the ending. Without any context, it goes into a direction I found fitting albeit one I didn’t expect at all. Still Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a must for newcomers or veterans of the metroidvania genre looking for something new, charming and short.  \n",

      " Quick Description:\n",
      "-Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th entry in the Momodora series and is hands down the most polished version of the series.  This is a cute, mini metroidvania that metroidvania fans are likely going to enjoy.  It's a one man team and is quite rough around the edges, but makes up for it w/ charm and engaging combat.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's Good:\n",
      "-This game has a ton of charm.  There are a lot of cute characters and npcs all over the map.  Even some of the larger than life bosses are adorable looking characters.  I like the contrast between the brutal combat and the cute characters.  There are enemies that kill in 2-3 hits and spikes that instantly kill you.  You would never expect that from such an adorable looking game.\n",
      "-I'm a big fan of the pixel art.  I like the way the bosses look, the impact when you hit enemies w/ your weapons, and when small star-like currency flies out of dead enemies.  The environment itself is serviceable, although not as polished as top tier games.\n",
      "-The boss fights are hands down the most fun and challenging part of this game.  There are a quite few bosses in this 5 hourish game.  Some of small and agile, while others are very imposing and towering above you.  These bosses hit hard and are tough.   Memorizing their patterns and equipping the right powerups are key to victory.\n",
      "-Lots of secrets to find.  I really loved exploring the world.  This is not that big of a metroidvania and the map isn't great, but traversing the world is still really fun.  You will be heavily rewarded for checking every square inch the map.  Some secrets are really obvious, while others are more obtuse.  Being able to equip more health potions, finding powerful relics, or simply gaining health can all be found if you search hard enough.\n",
      "-You have a basic short ranged four leaf clover and a long range bow.  I loved that they chose a four leaf clover to be used as a weapon.  It's small things like this that make Momodora stand out.  You can unlock powerups that make your arrows poisonous or add flames to your attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could Use a Few Changes:\n",
      "-Very difficult during the first 2 hrs.  You are way under-powered and thrown into the deep in.  During the first 30 minutes, there are several enemies that can 2-hit you.  Even after the first hr, there are a ton of enemies that can 3 hit you.  There are also lots of instant death spikes to avoid while platforming.  This is going to cause a lot of players to give up before really enjoying the meat of this game.\n",
      "-Pacing could use a lot of work.  I think this game would have benefit from adding one to two more areas and making this closer to a 8 hr experience.  Basically, as of right now, you spend your first two hrs dying left and right, then by the 4 hr mark, you become an incredibly overpowered tank that can brute force its way through almost everything.  If this game were a little longer, then they could have made the beginning a bit easier, and had a longer build up until you become extremely powerful.\n",
      "-Most people do not enjoy one hit death spikes.  They are used quite a bit here, especially in the second half of the game.  There has to be more creative ways to add new challenges to the end of the game.\n",
      "-Some areas of the map are kind of bizarre, and you can tell that this game lacks the polish that the best in the genre have.  You will also see quite a bit of duplicate enemies throughout the game.  Some enemies from the very beginning will also be at the very end in the same form.  This is not ideal imo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoughts:\n",
      "-I'm glad that I finally got around to playing Momodora.  I haven't played any of the other games in the series, but I've been told that this one is the best and most well rounded of the 4.  There is a final 5th game in the works which I'm excited to check out.  This isn't a perfect game but it's a competent metroidvania that fans of the genre should check out.  The dev was clearly inspired by Dark Souls and the challenging, methodical combat is one of the highlights of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consensus:\n",
      "-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  It's only $10 new but is an absolute steal right now while it's on sale for $4.  If you are scrambling to binge another metroidvania, than Momodora Reverie of the Moonlight is a fun one worthy of your time. i smacked a blue girls tiddies with a sword and they jiggled 10/10 Decent Metroidvania, Slightly Challenging, Janky Hitboxes on Higher Difficulties, Story wasn't anything special. A well-made Metroidvania, with good flow and controls. anime tiddy Really beautiful art style and animations, but slow pacing and lack of some original gameplay features made the game feel pretty monotonous. Also I am not a fan of the music. I've experienced several headakes while I was visiting some areas that had less resonant music than others.\n",
      "Generaly good game, but I'am not really impressed. Very punishing but not in a fun way. Somehow the fights are not fun. A short but sweet metroidvania. kinda fun This is not a long game, it is not particularly well polished in some regard but it is absolutely worth playing for the tone, atmosphere and general impression. It's a lovely little game A nice ~7 hour metroidvania, good pixel art, good bosses, difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating, relatively simple combat but in an enjoyable way. Fantanstic game, difficulty gets over hyped anyone could beat it if time is put in but even if you're pretty good the game is every likely to kill you. and FAIRLY! there's only a handful of \"kaizo\" traps and they are so few and far between. cute graphics, lit story, actual difficulty that makes you feel good when you beat a \"level\" easy 9/10 another beautiful indie that proves greatness can be had without HD graphics. fun gameplay and good writing go so far. love the game it's a classic and a steal when on sale. easily worth full price and i'm a scrooge. Very calming and nice game good game. charming and original. really cool. plesent surprise good excellent metroidvania and cute platformer step on me kaho. awesome sauce The art direction and animations in this are my absolute favourites. The gameplay is also great. Movement is tight, and items are pretty useful, save for one or two. I also love the couple of rooms and side characters that give the world a lot more depth. It's a simple little game you can finish in an hour or so, unless you're going for all the secrets (there's more than you think). One tip: there's a body of water that has a ladder going downwards; you won't drown in that.\n",

      "Even on Hard (the only difficulty I've tried - if I'm right and the Insane difficulty means you always die in one hit then it's no better, as it's very easy to avoid getting hit by absolutely anything) it's much too easy and much too short, and the relative inexperience of those behind the game is easy to see, with many mechanics only serving to pointlessly prolong the game in a way that doesn't feel at all natural. The combo system is badly done - it features good animations but they greatly harm the fluidity of the character's movement potential, and the cheap Dark Souls-style roll only harms that further given that, much like in DaS, it's exceptionally overpowered. The world itself, if it can even be called a  world, is poor at best too: the area transitions are very badly done and give the feeling of a severely disjointed world, many places have cheap tricks that are easily figured out after just a single death but which cannot be seen coming on the first try no matter how cautious the player is, and there's no real incentive to progress besides \"it's a game, you must progress\".\n",

It has your typical Metroidvania layout and will please explorers who want a great sense of atmosphere and completionists who want to 100% the game by letting them searching every nook and cranny for upgrades. The art and aesthetic are fantastic, you really get into the world this game paints (reminds me of Super Metroid in the respect of how great its atmosphere is). Music is ominous and beautiful; great soundtrack!\n",

I am also very suprised at how very little people know of this game, its great and easy to find were your going (not at first but I play dark souls) and the soundtrack and bosses are even more unique, even if you can cheese them. I am very glad I stumbled across this game on my first time on steam, buying a few others as well. play this game, you won't regret it.\n",
      "Short but very fun game. It can be a bit hard at times but certainly worth the effort. Gives a Castlevania meets Bloodborne kind of vibe.\n",
      "I recently finished this game after looking through my steam library for games that I hadn't touched, and I found it extremely enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game-play was responsive, challenging, and highly rewarding. I chose the Hard difficulty for my first run, and finished the game in around seven hours. Every time I got a game over, from a boss, or a common enemy, or from platforming hazards, I found myself determined to succeed the next time I tried - I just had to try again, and again, and again until I got it right.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, the game-play is the biggest draw this game has - that's not to say that the other factors were lacking though. The art, the music, the world, and the way the story is presented were all deeply enthralling. I'd also have a hard time trying to point out a significant number of flaws in the game, there's nothing negative that really comes to mind. Next, I'll be trying the Insane difficulty and attempting to get all the achievements.\n",
      "Really good game so far, I'll update it once I finish, but I'm really liking it so far.\n",
      "This game surprised me. Excellent Metroidvania gameplay for enticing exploration, blus incredibly fluid pixel animations with tight gameplay. That Mario-esque momentum makes the platforming feel really smooth. There's a Souls-like map design philosophy where progress is often a loop back to a bonfire (in this case bells) that will restore all of your healing items and miscellaneous consumables. I didn't notice much story: go beat the evil queen, slap some weird bosses around, give a bunny some bugs. But never you mind that. Momodora sports gorgeous visual stylings and a no-nonsense combat system I think any old-school gamer is going to love.\n",
      "Just a quick review...\n",
      "\n",
      "2 solid thumbs up. Very interesting story, solid controls, and engaging gameplay. Obvious dark souls simularities, which is one of the reasons I bought it.  Another great game in this vein is salt and sanctuary.  Anyway, have fun!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "E\n",
      "Beautiful visuals, excellent controls and satisfying combat mechanics make this game totally worth the price.\n",
      "Couldn't recommend this enough. Great game! It's only about 4 hours long but for 10 bucks thats about the right price. Gameplay feels great, awesome music as well. Looking forward to a sequel!\n",
      "good 2 hour or so game 8/10\n",
      "I found this to be a short and enjoyable Metroidvania game. The production value isn't very high (nowhere near as good as Hollow Knight or Ori and the Blind Forest), and you only gain a few abilities before the game ends. Nonetheless, it's worth a playthrough for those who enjoy a short challenge.\n",
      "Short ride, but I enjoyed every last minute of it.\n",
      "Great Platformer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cancer I got from watching too many cringe complimations, was cured by this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "420/42\n",
      "This game is not a mouse-controlled game.  In addition to up/down/left/right, this game uses 8 buttons (including the pause/menu button, and the map button).  Combat uses 6 of them. I found that 6 buttons are 1 or 2 too many for playing with a keyboard.  If you use keyboard controls in lots of games you'll probably be fine, but as someone who plays about 50% of games on consoles, I found that a controller made the experience much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a perfectly-difficult game with good art and soundtrack.  Dying resets you back to the last save point, and I found that it usually took me 2-3 tries to get to each new save point. Not too easy, but never impossible either.\n",
      "I am new to Metroidvanias. I thought I would start with games with a high steam review score.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just didn't find the game that fun really, not sure how else to describe it. It is obviously a good game given the scores but I'll never know which bit of it people get a buzz out of... Too each his own I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "I played Axiom Verge recently too, it was more drawn out with lots of tedious backtracking, so arguably a worse game, but at least it had an amazing theme and overarching story to pick away at.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in conclusion play it if you are a Metroidvania fan.\n",
      "Or if like me, you are just starting out on the genre maybe give this one a miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short and sweet Metroidvania. With thight, respondise controls and a somber but cute athmosphere to match.\n",

      "PROS:\n",
      "+Awesome combat system.\n",
      "+Good Soundtrack.\n",
      "+Boss fights.\n",

      "+Pretty good lore so far.\n",

      "CONS:\n",
      "-Can be pretty hard/annoying, but nothing more than this.\n",
