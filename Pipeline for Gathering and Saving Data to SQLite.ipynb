      "Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a cutesy pixel Metroidvania game with few memorable boss battle with suitable background music while you hack and slash your way to the next boss battle, which you need the skill to dodge the attack because you'll be doing a lot of trial and error even tho the game is short but there is a few flaws on the game, the level design is alright but can be irritated later on, in a certain point in the game you have to go back to the beginning so you can go to the next area, you'll be climbing a lot of ladder or jumping on bouncy pink jelly, overall the game is good and worth getting it.\n",
      "THE GOOD + Controls feel VERY good, not once have I died or even took damage because of them, if you mess up it is 100% your fault; + 3 + 1 difficulty settings; + Nonlinear; + Lots of helpful items, everything's useful for a different scenario, but you never find yourself depending on them; + A fair amount of secrets and illusory walls; + Replay value; (2 endings, NG+, unlockable Insane mode, achievements for pacifist and no-death runs) + Well animated pixel graphics; + Fitting BGM; + Silent protagonist; (yes this is a plus) + Female protagonist; (also a big plus) Protagonist can transform into a cat; + So many things remind me of Dark Souls and Castlevania: mainly the atmosphere, and also the music, the bosses, the NPCs, the item descriptions revealing bits of lore... and so on, but I don't want to sound like \"lololol dork soulz ripoff.\n",
      "Momodora: RUtM is a 2D Side-Scrolling Platform game which has you travelling to various locations in an attempt to take down the corrupted Queen who has infected Kaho's village of Lan, in all seriousness, this is a really good game, as someone who plays 2D Side-Scrolling Platformers often, I highly reccomend this game to anyone who is also a fan, the game itself is fairly short, but I find it has good replay value, I've found myself playing through this game multiple times already and I am currently speedrunning it and planning to pick up 100% for it fairly soon, once you actually find where everything is, it's hard to forget, although I still find myself making mistakes over and over again and if you're looking for a challenge, I reccomend trying to beat Hard Difficulty and even Insane Difficulty which you unlock for beating Hard, I am yet to beat Insane Difficulty but I wish any who try the best of luck.\n"
